Introduction to collider shapes

# Collider shapes

Colliders are available in different shape configurations. A **collider** An
invisible shape that is used to handle physical collisions for an object. A
collider doesn’t need to be exactly the same shape as the object’s mesh - a
rough approximation is often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay.
[More info](CollidersOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Collider)’s shape defines how accurately the
collider matches the **Mesh** The main graphics primitive of Unity. Meshes
make up a large part of your 3D worlds. Unity supports triangulated or
Quadrangulated polygon meshes. Nurbs, Nurms, Subdiv surfaces must be converted
to polygons. [More info](mesh.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Mesh) shape, and how computationally efficient
the collider is.

**Topic** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Introduction to collider shapes](collider-shapes-introduction.html) | Overview of the different collider shapes in Unity.  
[Primitive collider shapes](primitive-colliders.html) | Primitive collider shapes are built-in, pre-calculated collider shapes in Unity (Box, Sphere and Capsule colliders).  
[Mesh colliders](mesh-colliders.html)A free-form collider component which
accepts a mesh reference to define its collision surface shape. [More
info](class-MeshCollider.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#MeshCollider) | Mesh colliders create **collision** A collision occurs when the physics engine detects that the colliders of two GameObjects make contact or overlap, when at least one has a Rigidbody component and is in motion. [More info](CollidersOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Collision) geometry that matches the shape of
their associated Mesh, for extremely accurate collisions.  
[Wheel colliders](wheel-colliders.html)A special collider for grounded
vehicles. It has built-in collision detection, wheel physics, and a slip-based
tire friction model. It can be used for objects other than wheels, but it is
specifically designed for vehicles with wheels. [More info](class-
WheelCollider.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#WheelCollider) | Wheel colliders use raycasting to form wheel-shaped collision geometry with suspension and tyre-based friction.  
[Terrain colliders](terrain-colliders.html)A terrain-shaped collider component
that handles collisions for collision surface with the same shape as the
Terrain object it is attached to. [More info](class-TerrainCollider.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#TerrainCollider) | **Terrain** The landscape in your scene. A Terrain GameObject adds a large flat plane to your scene and you can use the Terrain’s Inspector window to create a detailed landscape. [More info](terrain-UsingTerrains.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Terrain) colliders create collision geometry
that matches the shape of their associated Terrain, for extremely accurate
collisions.  
[Compound colliders](compound-colliders.html) | Compound colliders are a combination of multiple other colliders, which together have a single **center of mass** Represents the average position of all mass in a Rigidbody for the purposes of physics calculations. By default it is computed from all colliders belonging to the Rigidbody, but can be modified via script. [More info](../ScriptReference/Rigidbody-centerOfMass.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#CenterofMass).
