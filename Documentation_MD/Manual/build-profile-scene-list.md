# Manage scenes in your build

Use the ****Scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game.
Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place
your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and
building your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene) List** to organize the scenes in your
build. Unity builds scenes in the order they appear in the list, and you can
add, exclude, remove, and reorder scenes in the list.

Access the scene list by navigating to **File** > **Build Profiles** >
**Platforms** > **Scene List**.

Use the following actions to manage the scene list:

**List action** | **Description**  
---|---  
**Add** | Use **Add Open Scenes** to add all currently open scenes to the list. You can also drag scenes from the **Project** window into the list.  
**Exclude** | Clear the checkbox next to a scene to exclude it from the build . This removes the scene from the build, but not from the list.  
**Remove** | Right click on a scene name and select **Remove Selection** to remove it from the list.  
**Reorder** | To adjust the scene order, drag scenes into a different position in the list.
