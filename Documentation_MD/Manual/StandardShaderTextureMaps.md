# Texture maps

Approaches for adding detail to the surface of a model.

**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Normal maps](StandardShaderMaterialParameterNormalMapLanding.html)A type of
Bump Map texture that allows you to add surface detail such as bumps, grooves,
and scratches to a model which catch the light as if they are represented by
real geometry.  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Normalmap) | Techniques for adding surface detail such as bumps, grooves, and scratches that catch the light.  
[Height maps](StandardShaderMaterialParameterHeightMap.html) | Learn about shifting the areas of the visible surface texture, to achieve a surface-level occlusion effect.  
[Occlusion maps](StandardShaderMaterialParameterOcclusionMap.html) | Learn about providing information about which areas of the model should receive high or low indirect lighting.  
[Add light emission to a material](StandardShaderMaterialParameterEmission.html) | Make a material appear as a visible source of light in your **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene).  
[Secondary Maps and Detail Mask](StandardShaderMaterialParameterDetail.html) | Learn about creating sharp detail when a material is viewed up close.
