# Android plug-in types

Unity supports multiple **plug-in** A set of code created outside of Unity
that creates functionality in Unity. There are two kinds of plug-ins you can
use in Unity: Managed plug-ins (managed .NET assemblies created with tools
like Visual Studio) and Native plug-ins (platform-specific native code
libraries). [More info](./plug-ins.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Plug-in) types for Android applications. Each
plug-in type has its own capabilities so, if you want to create your own plug-
in for a particular use-case, make sure to select the most relevant plug-in
type for the use-case.
