# Binding examples

Learn Editor data binding from examples.

## Basic Editor binding examples

**Topics** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Bind with binding path in C# script](UIE-create-a-binding-csharp.html) | Use `bindingPath` to create a binding that changes the name of a **GameObject** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject) in a custom Editor window.  
[Bind without the binding path](UIE-bind-without-bindpath.html) | Use `BindProperty()` to create a binding that changes the name of a GameObject in a custom Editor window.  
[Bind with UXML and C#](UIE-create-a-binding-uxml-bind.html) | Create a binding and set the binding path in UXML, and bind with `Bind()` in C#.  
[Create a binding with the Inspector](UIE-create-a-binding-uxml-inspector.html) | Create a binding that binds among a custom **Inspector** A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. [More info](UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Inspector), a custom Editor, and serialized
objects.  
[Bind to nested properties](UIE-bind-to-nested-properties.html) | Use the `binding-path` attribute of a BindableElement in UXML to bind fields to nested properties of a SerializedObject  
[Bind to a UXML template](UIE-bind-uxml-template.html) | Create a binding and set binding paths with UXML templates.  
[Receive callbacks when a bound property changes](UIE-create-a-binding-callback.html) | Creates a custom Editor window with a TextField that binds to the name of a GameObject in a **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene).  
[Receive callbacks when any bound properties change](UIE-create-a-binding-callback-any-properties.html) | Create a custom Inspector with two fields that warns the user if the values of the fields fall outside certain ranges.  
  
## Advanced Editor binding examples

**Topics** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Bind to a list with ListView](UIE-bind-to-list.html) | Create a list of toggles and binds the list to an underlying list of objects.  
[Bind to a list without ListView](UIE-bind-to-list-without-listview.html) | Create a binding that binds to a list with array instead of ListView.  
[Bind a custom control](UIE-bind-custom-control.html) | Create a custom control and bind it to a native Unity type.  
[Bind a custom control to custom data type](UIE-bind-to-custom-data-type.html) | Create a custom control and bind it to a custom data type.
