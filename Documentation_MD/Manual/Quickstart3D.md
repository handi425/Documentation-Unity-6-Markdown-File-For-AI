# 3D game development quickstart guide

This quickstart guide provides a workflow for 3D game developers creating a 3D
game in Unity.

**Note** : This guide applies to all versions of Unity from 2019 LTS upwards.

This quickstart guide helps you:

  * Set up your Unity Project (Refer to the **Initial setup** section on this page)
  * [Create a 3D game](Quickstart3DCreate.html)

For detailed 3D game tutorials, refer to the following Unity Learn materials:

  * [Beginning 3D Development](https://learn.unity.com/course/beginning-3d-game-development) Learn Course
  * [John Lemon’s Haunted Jaunt: 3D Beginner Project](https://learn.unity.com/project/john-lemon-s-haunted-jaunt-3d-beginner)
  * See all [3D Learn Tutorials](https://learn.unity.com/search?k=%5B%22q%3A3D%22%5D)
  * [Create with Code](https://learn.unity.com/course/create-with-code)
  * [Creator Kit: Beginner Code](https://learn.unity.com/project/creator-kit-beginner-code)

## Initial setup

**Note:** For this guide, the recommended best practice is that you choose the
[Universal Render Pipeline (URP)](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/universal-
render-pipeline.html) and not the [Built-in Render
Pipeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/built-in-render-pipeline.html).

  1. Install Unity version 2019 LTS or a later version. Refer to [Installing Unity](GettingStartedInstallingUnity.html).
  2. Open the [Unity Hub](https://docs.unity3d.com/hub/manual/index.html). You can use the Hub to create and manage your Unity projects.
  3. Create a project and select the Universal **Render Pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) template. Refer to [Add and
remove projects in the Unity
Hub](https://docs.unity3d.com/hub/manual/AddProject.html) in the Hub
documentation.

For help familiarizing yourself with Unity and getting set up, refer to the
[Unity Learn Unity Essentials pathway](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/unity-
essentials).
