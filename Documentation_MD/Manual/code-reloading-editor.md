Configuring how Unity enters Play mode

# Code and scene reload on entering Play mode

Authoring your application in Edit mode and then switching to Play mode to
preview its runtime behavior is a core feature of iterative development in the
Unity Editor. By default the Editor reloads both your code and **scene** A
Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique
Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments,
obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in
pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene) assets as part of the transition from
Edit mode to Play mode. It’s important to understand what Unity reloads, why
and when it does so, and how you can configure the reloading behavior. This
helps you make informed trade-offs between development iteration time and the
degree to which Play mode accurately reflects your built application’s
performance.
