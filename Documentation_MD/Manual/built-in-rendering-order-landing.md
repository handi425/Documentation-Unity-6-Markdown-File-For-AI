Render queues and sorting behaviours in the Built-in Render Pipeline

# Rendering order in the Built-In Render Pipeline

Resources for using render queues and sorting behaviours to change how Unity
renders **GameObjects** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can
represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A
GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More
info](class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject).

**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Render queues and sorting behaviours](built-in-rendering-order.html) | Learn about how Unity renders GameObjects in groups called render queues, and sorts and draws objects based on their distance from the camera.  
[Set the render queue for a material](built-in-rendering-order-set-queue.html) | To change when Unity draws a material, override the render queue value of the material.  
[Set how a camera sorts materials](built-in-rendering-order-sorting.html) | Use the `Camera` or `Rendering` API to change how a camera sorts GameObjects.
