# Filtering the list

To narrow down which packages appear in the list panel, select the **Filters**
menu from the **Package Manager** window.

![Filter controls for Unity Registry \(left\) and My Assets
\(right\)](../uploads/Main/upm-ui-filter2.png) Filter controls for **Unity
Registry** (left) and **My Assets** (right)

**Note:** When you select **In Project** in the [navigation panel](upm-ui-
nav.html), the filter controls are disabled, because **In Project** has a
nested view to list packages that have updates.

Using the **My Assets** list as an example, you can use the following types of
filter options to narrow down the list of **Asset Store** A growing library of
free and commercial assets created by Unity and members of the community.
Offers a wide variety of assets, from textures, models and animations to whole
project examples, tutorials and Editor extensions. [More
info](AssetStore.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#AssetStore) packages displayed:

  * The **Status** group lets you choose one **Status** to list the packages that have that status. For example, if you choose **Unlabeled** , then only those Asset Store packages that you never assigned a label to appear in the list.
  * Choose one or more **Categories** to list the Asset Store packages that match your selection.
  * Choose one or more custom **Labels** that you created in the Asset Store for your packages. If you select more than one label, only those packages that match any one label remain in the list. For information about creating and managing labels, refer to [Using labels to organize My Assets](AssetPackagesLabels.html).

If you need to start over, click **Clear Filters** beside the **Filters** menu
to reset all filter options to their default values.
