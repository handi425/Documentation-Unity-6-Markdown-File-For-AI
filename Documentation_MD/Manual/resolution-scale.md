Introduction to changing resolution scale

# Changing resolution scale

To reduce the amount of work for the GPU and speed up rendering, you can
change the resolution of the image Unity renders.

**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Introduction to changing resolution scale](resolution-scale-introduction.html) | Learn about the different dynamic resolution and upscaling techniques in the different **render pipelines** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Renderpipeline).  
[Dynamic resolution](DynamicResolution-landing.html)A Camera setting that
allows you to dynamically scale individual render targets to reduce workload
on the GPU. [More info](DynamicResolution-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#dynamicresolution) | Resources for rendering at a lower resolution dynamically, to reduce the amount of work for the GPU.
