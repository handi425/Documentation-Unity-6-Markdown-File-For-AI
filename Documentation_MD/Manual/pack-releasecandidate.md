# Release candidates

In the alpha and beta versions of the Unity Editor, [pre-release](pack-
preview.html) packages become release candidates if they’re strong candidates
for official release. When a package becomes a release candidate state, Unity
guarantees that the package will transition to the [released](pack-safe.html)
state during the next stage of the release cycle (either TECH or LTS).

Packages that are Release Candidates appear in the [list of released
packages](pack-safe.html).

For a list of stable packages, including both release candidates and packages
that are officially released for this version, refer to [released
packages](pack-safe.html).

For more information about package states, refer to [package states and
lifecycle](upm-lifecycle.html).
