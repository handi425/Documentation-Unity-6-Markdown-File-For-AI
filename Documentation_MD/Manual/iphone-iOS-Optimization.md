# Optimize for mobile

When developing for mobile, it’s recommended to optimize your game for mobile
platforms as much as possible. Optimizing your title as part of the
development process can help you avoid performance issues later in the
development cycle.

For general tips on optimizing your game for mobile devices, refer to
