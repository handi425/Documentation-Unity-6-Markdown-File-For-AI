Android plug-in types

# Create and use plug-ins in Android

You can use plug-ins to deliver resources and call Java and C++ code created
outside of Unity from your C# **scripts** A piece of code that allows you to
create your own Components, trigger game events, modify Component properties
over time and respond to user input in any way you like. [More info](creating-
scripts.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scripts). They enable you to access features,
like third-party code libraries and operating systems calls, that would
otherwise not be available to Unity. For more information about plug-ins with
Unity, see [Plug-ins](./plug-ins.html)A set of code created outside of Unity
that creates functionality in Unity. There are two kinds of plug-ins you can
use in Unity: Managed plug-ins (managed .NET assemblies created with tools
like Visual Studio) and Native plug-ins (platform-specific native code
libraries). [More info](./plug-ins.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Plug-in).

This section describes how to create your own plug-ins and use them in Android
projects. The information on these pages assumes you already know how to
create native plug-ins for Unity. For more information about native plug-ins
and their uses, see [Native plug-ins](plug-ins-native.html)A platform-specific
native code library that is created outside of Unity for use in Unity. Allows
you can access features like OS calls and third-party code libraries that
would otherwise not be available to Unity. [More info](./plug-ins.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Nativeplug-in).

**Topic** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Android plug-in types](android-plugin-types.html) | Understand the different plug-in types available for Unity Android applications.  
[Call Java and Kotlin plug-in code from C# scripts](android-plugins-java-code-from-c-sharp.html) | Interact with Java and Kotlin plug-in code from your C# scripts.  
  
## Unity as a Library

If you upgrade your project to Unity 2019.4 or above, the introduction of
Unity as a Library might require you to adapt your [native](plug-ins-
native.html) and [managed](plug-ins-managed.html) plug-ins to work properly
for Android.
