# Manual license activation

You can manually activate a Unity license by using a serial key, if you’re
unable to activate it using the [other
methods](LicenseActivationMethods.html).

Note: The manual activation method works only with plans other than Unity
Personal.  
---  
  
**Important** : Manual license activation requires internet connectivity.
However, the manual activation method requires internet connectivity for only
one part of the process, and you can do that part on any connected computer;
not necessarily the same computer where you’ll use Unity.

There are two options for manually activating a license:

  * [Submit a license request from the Hub](ManualActivationHub.html)

  * Submit a license request using the command line and browser:

    * [Windows instructions](ManualActivationCmdWin.html)

    * [macOS and Linux instructions](ManualActivationCmdMac.html)

## Returning a manually activated license

If you manually activate a license, you can’t return it by using the [other
license management methods](LicenseActivationMethods.html); you’ll need to
contact support to assist with the return.
