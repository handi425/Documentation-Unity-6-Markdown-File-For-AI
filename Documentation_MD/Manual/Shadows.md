# Shadows

![Scene with objects casting shadows](../uploads/Main/ShadowIntro.png) Scene
with objects casting shadows

Shadows add a degree of depth and realism to a **scene** A Scene contains the
environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a
unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and
decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More
info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene) because they bring out the scale and
position of objects that might otherwise look flat. In Unity, lights can cast
shadows from a **GameObject** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which
can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A
GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More
info](class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject) onto other parts of itself, or
onto nearby GameObjects.
