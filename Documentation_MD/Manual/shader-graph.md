# Creating shaders with Shader Graph

Shader Graph is a tool that enables you to build shaders visually. Instead of
writing code, you create and connect nodes in a graph framework. **Shader** A
program that runs on the GPU. [More info](Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Shader) Graph gives instant feedback that
reflects your changes, and it’s simple enough for users who are new to shader
creation.

## Render pipeline compatibility

Feature | Universal **Render Pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) (URP) | High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) | Custom Scriptable Render Pipeline | Built-in Render Pipeline  
---|---|---|---|---  
Shader Graph | Yes | Yes | No | Yes  
  
## Getting started with Shader Graph

For instructions on installing and working with Shader Graph, see the [Shader
