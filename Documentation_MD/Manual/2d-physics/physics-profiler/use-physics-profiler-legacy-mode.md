# Use the Physics Profiler Legacy mode

You can switch to the **Legacy** mode to see the older version of the Physics
2D **Profiler** A window that helps you to optimize your game. It shows how
much time is spent in the various areas of your game. For example, it can
report the percentage of time spent rendering, animating, or in your game
logic. [More info](../../Profiler.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#Profiler) module, which was the default
module in older versions of Unity. To do this, select **Legacy** from the
dropdown menu at the upper-right of the Profiler module’s details pane.

In this mode, you can load and inspect Profiler data that was saved in an
older version of Unity. If you switch to this mode to inspect data captured in
a newer version of Unity, then the data displayed may be unreliable and
inaccurate. It is recommended to always use the **Current** mode to inspect
Physics 2D Profiler data in current versions of Unity.
