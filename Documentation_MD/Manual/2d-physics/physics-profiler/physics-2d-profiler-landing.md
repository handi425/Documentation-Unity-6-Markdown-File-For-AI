# Physics 2D Profiler

Approaches to analyzing the performance of 2D physics in your application.

**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Physics 2D Profiler module reference](physics-2d-profiler-module-reference.html) | Explore the **profiler** A window that helps you to optimize your game. It shows how much time is spent in the various areas of your game. For example, it can report the percentage of time spent rendering, animating, or in your game logic. [More info](../../Profiler.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#Profiler) properties for analyzing the
performance of 2D physics in your application.  
[Use the Physics Profiler Legacy mode](use-physics-profiler-legacy-mode.html) | Set the physics profiler module to legacy mode to work with data from old versions of the Unity Editor.
