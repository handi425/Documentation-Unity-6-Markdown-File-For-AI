Introduction to Rigidbody 2D

# Rigidbody 2D

Rigidbodies enable physics-based behavior, such as reactions to gravity, mass,
drag, and momentum. A **Rigidbody** A component that allows a GameObject to be
affected by simulated gravity and other forces. [More info](../../class-
Rigidbody.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#Rigidbody) 2D is a 2D component you can
use to enable an object to act under the control of physics.

**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Introduction to Rigidbody 2D](introduction-to-rigidbody-2d.html) | Learn how to use Rigidbody 2D in your project and how they interact with **Collider** An invisible shape that is used to handle physical collisions for an object. A collider doesn’t need to be exactly the same shape as the object’s mesh - a rough approximation is often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay. [More info](../../CollidersOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#Collider) 2D components.  
[Rigidbody 2D body types](body-types/rigidbody-2d-body-types-landing.html) | Choose which **Body Type** Defines a fixed behavior for a 2D Rigidbody. Can be Dynamic (the body moves under simulation and is affected by forces like gravity), Kinematic (the body moves under simulation, but and isn’t affected by forces like gravity) or Static (the body doesn’t move under simulation). [More info](../../2d-physics/rigidbody/introduction-to-rigidbody-2d.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#BodyType) to use to define the behavior
of the Rigidbody 2D.  
[Rigidbody 2D Simulated property](rigidbody-2d-simulated-property.html) | Use this property to start or stop a Rigidbody 2D and any attached Collider 2Ds and **Joint** A physics component allowing a dynamic connection between Rigidbody components, usually allowing some degree of movement such as a hinge. [More info](../../Joints.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#joint) 2Ds from interacting with the 2D
physics simulation.
