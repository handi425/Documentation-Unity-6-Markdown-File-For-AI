Dynamic Body Type

# Dynamic Body Type fundamentals

The **Dynamic** **Body Type** Defines a fixed behavior for a 2D Rigidbody. Can
be Dynamic (the body moves under simulation and is affected by forces like
gravity), Kinematic (the body moves under simulation, but and isn’t affected
by forces like gravity) or Static (the body doesn’t move under simulation).
[More info](../../../../2d-physics/rigidbody/introduction-to-
rigidbody-2d.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../../../Glossary.html#BodyType) is the default Body Type
for a **Rigidbody** A component that allows a GameObject to be affected by
simulated gravity and other forces. [More info](../../../../class-
Rigidbody.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../../../Glossary.html#Rigidbody) 2D, because it is the
most common Body Type for things that need to move and is designed to move
under simulation. All Rigidbody 2D properties are available with this Body
Type, such as finite mass and drag, and is affected by gravity and forces. A
Dynamic body will collide with every other Body Type, and is the most
interactive of Body Types. It’s also the most performance-expensive Body Type,
because of its dynamic nature and interactivity with everything around it.
