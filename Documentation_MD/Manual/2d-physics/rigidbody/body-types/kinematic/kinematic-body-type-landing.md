Kinematic Body Type fundamentals

# Kinematic Body Type

Techniques and resources for working with a Kinematic **Body Type** Defines a
fixed behavior for a 2D Rigidbody. Can be Dynamic (the body moves under
simulation and is affected by forces like gravity), Kinematic (the body moves
under simulation, but and isn’t affected by forces like gravity) or Static
(the body doesn’t move under simulation). [More
info](../../../../2d-physics/rigidbody/introduction-to-rigidbody-2d.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../../../Glossary.html#BodyType) **Rigidbody** A
component that allows a GameObject to be affected by simulated gravity and
other forces. [More info](../../../../class-Rigidbody.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../../../Glossary.html#Rigidbody) 2D.
