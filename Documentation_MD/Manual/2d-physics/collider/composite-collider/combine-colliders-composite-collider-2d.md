# Combine Colliders with the Composite Collider 2D

All the supported **Collider** An invisible shape that is used to handle
physical collisions for an object. A collider doesn’t need to be exactly the
same shape as the object’s mesh - a rough approximation is often more
efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay. [More
info](../../../CollidersOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../../Glossary.html#Collider) components have the
[Composite
Operation](../../../../ScriptReference/Collider2D.compositeOperation.html)
property, which allows them be composed into a single Collider with the
Composite Collider 2D. These Colliders must also be attached to the same
[Rigidbody 2D](../../rigidbody/introduction-to-rigidbody-2d.html) as the
Composite Collider 2D. When you select a **Composite Operation** , other
properties disappear from that Collider, as they are now controlled by the
Composite Collider 2D.

Refer to the
[CompositeCollider2D](../../../../ScriptReference/CompositeCollider2D.html)
API documentation for more information about scripting with the Composite
Collider 2D.
