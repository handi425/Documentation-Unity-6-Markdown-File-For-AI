# Collider 2D

When you attach a **collider** An invisible shape that is used to handle
physical collisions for an object. A collider doesn’t need to be exactly the
same shape as the object’s mesh - a rough approximation is often more
efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay. [More
info](../../CollidersOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#Collider) 2D component to a
**GameObject** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent
characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s
functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More
info](../../class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#GameObject), the collider 2D defines
which area of the GameObject has **collision** A collision occurs when the
physics engine detects that the colliders of two GameObjects make contact or
overlap, when at least one has a Rigidbody component and is in motion. [More
info](../../CollidersOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#Collision) and can interact with other
colliders in the **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your
game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you
place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and
building your game in pieces. [More info](../../CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#Scene). The collider 2D is invisible,
and it’s shape is about the same shape as the GameObject for more accurate
collisions. You can adjust a collider’s shape and other properties in its
**Inspector** A Unity window that displays information about the currently
selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and
edit the values. [More info](../../UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#Inspector) window properties.

Colliders for 2D GameObjects all have names ending with 2D. You can’t use 3D
GameObjects with 2D colliders, or 2D GameObjects with 3D colliders.

You can use the following types of collider 2Ds with [Rigidbody
