Techniques and resources for working with and configuring a Capsule
**Collider** An invisible shape that is used to handle physical collisions for
an object. A collider doesn’t need to be exactly the same shape as the
object’s mesh - a rough approximation is often more efficient and
indistinguishable in gameplay. [More info](../../../CollidersOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../../Glossary.html#Collider) 2D.

[Capsule Collider 2D component reference](capsule-collider-2d-reference.html) | Refer to the **Capsule Collider** A capsule-shaped collider component that handles collisions for GameObjects like barrels and character limbs. [More info](../../../class-CapsuleCollider.html)

properties to create cylindrical shaped **collision** A collision occurs when
the physics engine detects that the colliders of two GameObjects make contact
or overlap, when at least one has a Rigidbody component and is in motion.
