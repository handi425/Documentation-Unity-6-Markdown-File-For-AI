# Constant Force 2D reference

****Constant Force** A simple component for adding a constant force or torque
to game objects with a Rigidbody. [More info](../class-ConstantForce.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#ConstantForce) 2D** is a quick utility for
adding constant forces to a ****Rigidbody** A component that allows a
GameObject to be affected by simulated gravity and other forces. [More
info](../class-Rigidbody.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Rigidbody) 2D**. This works well for one-
shot objects like rockets, if you want them to accelerate over time rather
than starting with a large velocity.

Constant Force 2D applies both linear and torque (angular) forces continuously
to the Rigidbody 2D, each time the **physics engine** A system that simulates
aspects of physical systems so that objects can accelerate correctly and be
affected by collisions, gravity and other forces. [More
info](../PhysicsSection.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#PhysicsEngine) updates at runtime.

## Properties

**Property** | **Function**  
---|---  
**Force** | The linear force applied to the Rigidbody 2D at each physics update.  
**Relative Force** | The linear force, relative to the Rigidbody 2D coordinate system, applied each physics update.  
**Torque** | The torque applied to the Rigidbody 2D at each physics update.
