Introduction to 2D joints

# 2D joints

Approaches and techniques for working with 2D **joints** A physics component
allowing a dynamic connection between Rigidbody components, usually allowing
some degree of movement such as a hinge. [More info](../../Joints.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#joint) in Unity.

**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Introduction to 2D joints](introduction-to-2d-joints.html) | Understand the fundamental concepts of 2D joints.  
[2D joint constraints](2d-joint-constraints.html) | Understand the constraints of using 2D joints.  
[Distance Joint 2D](distance-joint-2d-landing.html) | Techinques and resources for working with Distance Joint 2D components.  
[Fixed Joint 2D](fixed-joint-2d-landing.html)A 2D joint type which is
completely constrained, allowing two objects to be held together. Implemented
as a spring so some small motion may still occur. [More

See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#FixedJoint2D) | Techinques and resources for working with **Fixed Joint** A joint type that is completely constrained, allowing two objects to be held together. Implemented as a spring so some motion may still occur. [More info](../../class-FixedJoint.html)

[Friction Joint 2D](friction-joint-2d-landing.html) | Techinques and resources for working with Friction Joint 2D components.  
[Hinge Joint 2D](hinge-joint-2d-landing.html) | Techinques and resources for working with **Hinge Joint** A joint that groups together two Rigidbody components, constraining them to move like they are connected by a hinge. It is perfect for doors, but can also be used to model chains, pendulums and so on. [More info](../../class-HingeJoint.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#HingeJoint) 2D components.  
[Relative Joint 2D](relative-joint-2d-landing.html)A 2D joint that allows two
game objects controlled by Rigidbody physics to maintain in a position based
on each other’s location. Use this joint to keep two objects offset from each
other, at a position and angle you decide [More

[Spring Joint 2D](spring-joint-2d-landing.html) | Techinques and resources for working with **Spring Joint** A joint type that connects two Rigidbody components together but allows the distance between them to change as though they were connected by a spring.
