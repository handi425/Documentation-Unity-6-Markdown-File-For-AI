# Hinge Joint 2D

Techniques and resources for working with Hinge **Joint** A physics component
allowing a dynamic connection between Rigidbody components, usually allowing
some degree of movement such as a hinge. [More info](../../Joints.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#joint) 2D components.

**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Hinge Joint 2D fundamentals](hinge-joint-2d-fundamentals.html) | Understand the **Hinge Joint** A joint that groups together two Rigidbody components, constraining them to move like they are connected by a hinge. It is perfect for doors, but can also be used to model chains, pendulums and so on. [More info](../../class-HingeJoint.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#HingeJoint) 2D component and how it’s
used to rotate a **GameObject** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which
can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A
GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More
