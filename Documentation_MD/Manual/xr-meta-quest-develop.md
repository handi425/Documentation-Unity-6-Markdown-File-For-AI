# Develop for Meta Quest workflow

Unity supports development for Meta Quest 2, 3, and 3S, and Quest Pro.

The following sections outline Unity’s resources and packages to develop for
Meta Quest devices.

## Packages

Unity provides multiple packages that you can use to develop for Meta Quest
devices. The route you choose to develop for Meta Quest depends on whether
you’re also targeting other **XR** An umbrella term encompassing Virtual
Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality (MR) applications.
Devices supporting these forms of interactive applications can be referred to
as XR devices. [More info](XR.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#XR) platforms.

Refer to the following table to understand when to use each of Unity’s Meta
Quest-compatible packages:

**Package** | **Description** | ****VR** Virtual Reality [More info](VROverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#VR)/**MR** Mixed Reality  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#MR)** | **Target platform**  
---|---|---|---  
[Unity OpenXR plug-in](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.openxr@1.13/manual/index.html) | Integrates core OpenXR features. | VR and MR | All [OpenXR runtimes.](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.openxr@1.13/manual/index.html#runtimes)  
[Unity Meta OpenXR](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.meta-openxr@2.0/manual/index.html) | Integrates Meta-specific vendor extensions of OpenXR to provide additional features for Meta Quest devices. Provides Meta Quest integration for [AR Foundation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@6.1/manual/index.html) to enable **mixed reality** Mixed Reality (MR) combines its own virtual environment with the user’s real-world environment and allows them to interact with each other.  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#MixedReality) features. | VR and MR | Provides additional OpenXR features for Meta Quest devices, such as Passthrough.  
[Oculus XR plug-in](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.oculus@4.4/manual/index.html) | Tools, SDKs and resources for VR development on Quest. | VR | Meta Quest devices only.  
  
**Tip:** You can use the Unity OpenXR **plug-in** A set of code created
outside of Unity that creates functionality in Unity. There are two kinds of
plug-ins you can use in Unity: Managed plug-ins (managed .NET assemblies
created with tools like Visual Studio) and Native plug-ins (platform-specific
native code libraries). [More info](./plug-ins.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Plug-in) and the Unity Meta OpenXR package
together to develop a cross-platform application that has additional features
tailored for Meta Quest devices.

To learn more about the packages Unity provides for XR development, refer to
[XR packages](xr-support-packages.html).

### Meta packages

Meta also provides packages to develop for Meta Quest in Unity. Refer to
Meta’s [Import XR
packages](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/unity-
package-manager/#meta-xr-packages-overview) documentation to learn about the
packages Meta provides.

**Note:** These packages and related documentation are maintained by Meta.

## Templates

You can use the following templates as a starting point for your Meta Quest
project:

  * [Mixed Reality template](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.template.mixed-reality@2.0)
  * [VR Template](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.template.vr@9.0)
  * [VR Multiplayer template](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.template.vr-multiplayer@2.0)

Refer to [Create an XR project](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/xr-create-
projects.html) to understand how to use templates as a starting point for your
project.
