Uses of layers in Unity

# Layers

Layers are a tool that allows you to separate **GameObjects** The fundamental
object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery,
cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the
Components attached to it. [More info](class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject) in your scenes. You can use layers
through the **UI**(User Interface) Allows a user to interact with your
application. Unity currently supports three UI systems. [More info](UI-system-
compare.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#UI) and with **scripts** A piece of code that
allows you to create your own Components, trigger game events, modify
Component properties over time and respond to user input in any way you like.
[More info](creating-scripts.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scripts) to edit how GameObjects within your
**scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of
each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your
environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building
your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene) interact with each other.

You can select which layers display in the **Scene view** An interactive view
into the world you are creating. You use the Scene View to select and position
scenery, characters, cameras, lights, and all other types of Game Object.
[More info](UsingTheSceneView.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#SceneView) from the [View Options
overlay](ViewModes.html).
