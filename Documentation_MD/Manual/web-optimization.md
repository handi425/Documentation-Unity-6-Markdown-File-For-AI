Recommended Graphics settings to optimize your Web build

# Optimize your Web build

It’s important to optimize your Web build because Web-based applications
perform best when you have a small build. A small build means there’s less
data to download during initialization, which reduces load times. Slow load
times can result in poor user experience and a high bounce rate.

To optimize your Web build for mobile, refer to [Optimize Web platform for
mobile](web-optimization-mobile.html).

Use these recommendations to make optimizations specific to Unity Web
platform.

**Topic** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Recommended Graphics settings to optimize your Web build](web-optimization-graphics.html) | Change the Graphics settings to create an optimized Web build.  
[Recommended Quality settings to optimize your Web build](web-optimization-quality.html) | Change the Quality settings to create an optimized Web build.  
[Recommended Player settings to optimize your Web build](web-optimization-player.html) | Change the **Player settings** Settings that let you set various player-specific options for the final game built by Unity. [More info](class-PlayerSettings.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#PlayerSettings) to create an optimized Web
build.  
[Use C# code to enable optimization settings](web-optimization-c-sharp.html) | Use a C# script to enable some optimization settings.  
[Remove unused resources from your Web build](web-optimization-remove-resources.html) | Remove unused packages and **shader** A program that runs on the GPU. [More info](Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Shader) variants from your build.
