# Install a UPM package from a registry

**Note** : When you install a **UPM package** A **Package** managed by the
**Unity Package Manager**. Refer to **Packages**.  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#UPMpackage) using Package Manager, the Package
Manager evaluates other packages and their dependencies to determine if there
are version conflicts with the version you selected. If it detects any
conflicts or restrictions, it installs the version that resolves these issues.
For more information, refer to [Dependency and resolution](upm-
dependencies.html).

Use the same process for installing a package from either the Unity registry
or any [scoped registry](upm-scoped.html) defined in your project.

  1. Open the **Package Manager** window and select **Unity Registry** from the [navigation panel](upm-ui-nav.html). If you set up a [scoped registry](upm-scoped.html) and you want to install a package from a scoped registry, choose **My Registries** instead.

**Note** : If you haven’t defined any scoped registries for this project, **My
Registries** doesn’t appear in the navigation panel.

![Select Unity Registry or My Registries](../uploads/Main/upm-ui-
unityregistry.png) Select **Unity Registry** or **My Registries**

  2. Select the package you want to install from the [list of packages](upm-ui-list.html). The package information appears in the [details panel](upm-ui-details.html).

**Note:** If the Package Manager doesn’t list the package you want to install
in the list of packages, it might be an undiscoverable package, such as an
[experimental](pack-exp.html) or [pre-release](pack-preview.html) package. The
Package Manager doesn’t display experimental packages unless they’re already
installed, but pre-release packages appear in the Package Manager when you
enable the [Show Pre-release Package Versions](class-
PackageManager.html#advanced_preview) project setting.

  3. Optional: If multiple versions are available, select the version to install. For more information on available versions, refer to [Finding a specific version](upm-ui-find.html#VersionList).

  4. Click **Install**.

When the progress bar finishes, the new package is ready to use.

**Note** : You can install multiple packages with one click by using the
multiple select feature. For more information, refer to [Perform an action on
multiple packages or feature sets](upm-ui-multi.html).
