# Use your native audio DSP plug-in and GUI in Unity

Once you create your [audio DSP plug-in](AudioNativeDSPPlugin.html) and
[customize your GUI to your liking](AudioNativeCustomGUI.html), you can build
your file and import it into Unity.

## 1\. Compile and build your plug-ins

You must implement your **plug-ins** A set of code created outside of Unity
that creates functionality in Unity. There are two kinds of plug-ins you can
use in Unity: Managed plug-ins (managed .NET assemblies created with tools
like Visual Studio) and Native plug-ins (platform-specific native code
libraries). [More info](./plug-ins.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Plug-in) as a dynamic library for your
preferred platform. Unlike with **scripts** A piece of code that allows you to
create your own Components, trigger game events, modify Component properties
over time and respond to user input in any way you like. [More info](creating-
scripts.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scripts), any platform that you want to
support must be able to compile this file, along with platform-specific
optimizations.

For information about how to build your plug-in into a library file for each
platform, refer to [Building plug-ins for desktop platforms](plug-ins-for-
desktop.html).

## 2\. Rename your audio plug-in DLL file

  * Add the prefix “audioplugin” to the name of your DLL file (case insensitive). For example `audioplugin-myplugin.dll`

Unlike other **native plug-ins** A platform-specific native code library that
is created outside of Unity for use in Unity. Allows you can access features
like OS calls and third-party code libraries that would otherwise not be
available to Unity. [More info](./plug-ins.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Nativeplug-in), Unity needs to load audio
plug-ins before it creates any mixer assets that might need effects from a
plug-in. But Unity doesn’t do this by default.

Add the prefix “audioplugin” to the name of your DLL file so that the Unity
Editor detects and adds your plug-in to a list of plug-ins that Unity
automatically loads as the build starts.

## 3\. Import your audio plug-in into Unity

Click and drag your plug-in library file into the Asset folder of your Unity
project. Unity automatically installs your plug-in and it is ready to use.

## 4\. Link the plug-in to a platform

Native audio plug-ins use the same scheme as other native or **managed plug-
ins** A managed .NET assembly that is created with tools like Visual Studio
for use in Unity. [More info](./plug-ins.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Managedplug-in): You must use the plug-in
importer **Inspector** A Unity window that displays information about the
currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to
inspect and edit the values. [More info](UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Inspector) to associate your plug-in with your
preferred platforms. For more information, refer to [Plugin Inspector](plug-
in-inspector.html).

  * [Audio Spatializer](AudioSpatializerSDK.html)A plug-in that changes the way audio is transmitted from an audio source into the surrounding space. It takes the source and regulates the gains of the left and right ear contributions based on the distance and angle between the AudioListener and the AudioSource.
