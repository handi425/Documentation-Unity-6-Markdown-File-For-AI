# Visual Effect Graph

The Visual Effect Graph is a package that you can use to create large-scale
visual effects for your Unity Project. The Visual Effect Graph simulates
particle behavior on the GPU, which allows it to simulate many more particles
than the Built-in **Particle System** A component that simulates fluid
entities such as liquids, clouds and flames by generating and animating large
numbers of small 2D images in the scene. [More info](class-
ParticleSystem.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#particlesystem). If you want to create visual
effects that include a large number of particles and need highly customisable
behavior, use the Visual Effect Graph instead of the Built-in Particle System.
For information on how to install and use the Visual Effect Graph, see the
[getting started
guide](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.visualeffectgraph@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/GettingStarted.html).
