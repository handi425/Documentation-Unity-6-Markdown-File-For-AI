# Feature sets

Feature sets are groups of [packages](PackagesList.html)Packages are
collections of assets to be shared and re-used in Unity. The [Unity Package
Manager](upm-ui.html) (UPM) can display, add, and remove packages from your
project. These packages are native to the Unity Package Manager and provide a
fundamental method of delivering Unity functionality. However, the Unity
Package Manager can also display [Asset Store
packages](AssetStorePackages.html) that you downloaded from the Asset Store.
[More info](Packages.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Packages) that enable you to achieve specific
results in Unity. For example, the 2D **feature set** provides all the
functionality you need to create 2D games for various art styles.

All the packages in a feature set are compatible with each other for that
version of the feature set. You can install feature sets using the [Package
Manager](fs-install.html).

The following feature sets are available in this release of Unity:

  * [2D](2DFeature.html): Create 2D game worlds with animated characters and 2D physics.
  * [3D Characters and Animation](CharacterAnimationFeature.html): Animate characters and create cutscenes, sequences or movies.
