# Report crash bugs for iOS

You can report crash bugs for iOS with Unity [Bug
Reporting](https://unity.com/releases/editor/qa/bug-reporting). If your
application crashes in the Xcode debugger, it’s recommended to add the Xcode
console output to your bug report. Use the following steps to access the
console output if your application crashes:

**Note** : Before submitting a [bug
report](https://unity.com/releases/editor/qa/bug-reporting), refer to
[Troubleshooting on iOS devices](TroubleShootingIPhone.html) where you will
find solutions to common crashes and other problems.

  1. From the **Debug** menu , select **Continue** twice.
  2. Open the debugger console from **View** > **Debug Area** > **Activate Console**.
  3. In the console, type `thread backtrace all` and press **Enter**.
  4. Copy the console output and attach it to your bug report.

When reporting any application freezes, you can click **Pause** and repeat the
previous steps.

If your application crashes on the iOS device, it’s recommended to retrieve
the crash report. To achieve this, refer to [Acquiring Crash and Low Memory
Reports](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2151/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40008184-CH1-ACQUIRING_CRASH_AND_LOW_MEMORY_REPORTS)
(Apple Developer). Attach the crash report, your built application, and the
console log to your bug report.
