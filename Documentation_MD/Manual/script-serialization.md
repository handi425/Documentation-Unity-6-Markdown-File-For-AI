Serialization rules

# Script serialization

**Serialization** is the automatic process of transforming data structures or
**GameObject** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent
characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s
functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](class-
GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject) states into a format that Unity
can store and reconstruct later.

How you organize data in your Unity project affects how Unity serializes that
data, which can have a significant impact on the performance of your project.
This page outlines serialization in Unity and how to optimize your project for
it.
