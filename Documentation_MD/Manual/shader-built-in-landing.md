Prebuilt shaders render pipeline compatibility reference

# Prebuilt shaders

Resources for the prebuilt **shaders** A program that runs on the GPU. [More
info](Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Shader) in Unity. Use prebuilt shaders to
create a wide range of materials, from simple unlit colors to physically-based
lit surfaces.

Page | Description  
---|---  
[Prebuilt shaders render pipeline compatibility reference](shader-built-in.html) | Explore which prebuilt shaders are compatible with which **render pipelines** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Renderpipeline).  
[Legacy prebuilt shaders](Built-inShaderGuide.html) | Resources for the over 80 legacy shaders that are included in Unity for backwards compatibility, but aren’t recommended for new projects.
