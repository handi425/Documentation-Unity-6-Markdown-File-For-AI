# Deprecating your Assets

When you set a package as deprecated, the package no longer displays when you
search the **Asset Store** A growing library of free and commercial assets
created by Unity and members of the community. Offers a wide variety of
assets, from textures, models and animations to whole project examples,
tutorials and Editor extensions. [More info](AssetStore.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#AssetStore). For new customers, it’s removed
from the store. However, customers who have already purchased or downloaded
the package can still download the package.

Once you deprecate a package, you need to submit a new draft for review.

To deprecate an Asset:

  1. Open the [Asset Store Publisher](https://publisher.assetstore.unity3d.com/) portal and navigate to the **Packages** tab.

  2. Select the **Published** view in the drop-down menu.
