# Android keystores

A keystore is a binary file that contains private keys and public key
certificates. Android uses the keys in a keystore to sign an application for
security reasons. For more information, see [Keystores, keys, and
certificates](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-
signing#certificates-keystores).

## Android keystores in Unity

To interface with keystores, Unity provides the Keystore Manager and
properties in **Player Settings** Settings that let you set various player-
specific options for the final game built by Unity. [More info](class-
PlayerSettings.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#PlayerSettings). You can use these tools to
create, configure, or load **Android keystores** An Android system that lets
you store cryptographic key entries for enhanced device security. [More
info](class-PlayerSettingsAndroid.html#projectkeystore)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#AndroidKeystore) and keys.

**Note** : If you sign an application with a particular key and upload the
application to an app store, you must sign future versions of the application
with the same key.
