Introduction to 3D textures

# 3D textures

[Switch to Scripting](../ScriptReference/Texture3D.html "Go to Texture3D page
in the Scripting Reference")

Resources for creating and using a bitmap image that contains information in
three dimensions, for example to create volumetric effects, 3D meshes, or
animated textures.

Page | Description  
---|---  
[Introduction to 3D textures](class-Texture3D-introduction.html) | Learn how 3D textures are used to simulate volumetric effects, approximate a volumetric 3D **mesh** The main graphics primitive of Unity. Meshes make up a large part of your 3D worlds. Unity supports triangulated or Quadrangulated polygon meshes. Nurbs, Nurms, Subdiv surfaces must be converted to polygons. [More info](mesh.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Mesh), or store animated textures.  
[Import a 3D texture](class-Texture3D-import.html) | Import a flipbook texture as a 3D texture.  
[Preview a 3D texture](class-Texture3D-preview.html) | View an imported 3D texture as a cube, slices, or a signed distance field (SDF).  
[Create a 3D texture in a script](class-Texture3D-create.html) | Use the `Texture3D` API to create or edit a 3D texture in a script.  
[Sample a 3D texture in a shader](class-Texture3D-use-in-shader.html) | Sample an imported 3D texture in a **shader** A program that runs on the GPU. [More info](Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Shader), and use it to create a volumetric
effect.
