# Introduction to lighting data

Precomputed lighting data and baked lighting are not the same.

Baked lighting data is static. For example, the appearance of a **GameObject**
The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props,
scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined
by the Components attached to it. [More info](class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject) can change as it moves around a
**Light Probe** Light probes store information about how light passes through
space in your scene. A collection of light probes arranged within a given
space can improve lighting on moving objects and static LOD scenery within
that space. [More info](LightProbes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#LightProbe) (if that GameObject has Contribute
Global Illumination enabled). However, the data in the Light Probe itself does
not change. Unity can store baked lighting data in **lightmaps** A pre-
rendered texture that contains the effects of light sources on static objects
in the scene. Lightmaps are overlaid on top of scene geometry to create the
effect of lighting. [More info](Lightmapping.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Lightmap), Light Probes, and Reflection
Probes.

Enlighten Realtime **Global Illumination** A group of techniques that model
both direct and indirect lighting to provide realistic lighting results.  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#globalillumination) does not rely on baked
lighting. Instead, it uses precomputed visibility data to speed up the process
of determining how a light moving in real-time affects the surfaces that its
rays can reach.

## Generating lighting data

The Editor follows different steps to calculate **Enlighten** A lighting
system by Geomerics used in Unity for Enlighten Realtime Global Illumination.
[More info](https://www.siliconstudio.co.jp/en/products-service/enlighten/)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Enlighten) Realtime Global Illumination and
Baked Global Illumination. The progress bar displays information about the
current process. You can continue working in the Editor while the processes
run.

The stages of lighting precomputation are listed below:

**Enlighten Realtime Global Illumination**

  1. Create Geometry
  2. Layout Systems
  3. Create Systems
  4. Create Atlas
  5. Clustering
  6. Visibility
  7. Light Transport
  8. Tetrahedralize Probes
  9. Create ProbeSet

**Probes**

  1. Ambient Probes
  2. Baked/Realtime Ref. Probes

## Generating data

Unity’s precomputed lighting solutions only consider static geometry. To begin
the lighting precompute process, you need at least one
[Static](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/StaticObjects.html) **GameObject** in
your ****Scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game.
Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place
your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and
building your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene)**.

When you initiate a precompute, the Unity Editor evaluates and computes all
aspects of your Scene lighting. To recalculate and bake only [Reflection
Probes](class-ReflectionProbe.html)A rendering component that captures a
spherical view of its surroundings in all directions, rather like a camera.
The captured image is then stored as a Cubemap that can be used by objects
with reflective materials. [More info](class-ReflectionProbe.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#ReflectionProbe), select the **Generate
Lighting** option **Reflection Probes** [Lighting Window](lighting-
window.html).

## Before you build

Before building your game, generate the lighting data for all your Scenes, to
ensure that you do not lose any lighting data.

When you generate lighting for your Scene, Unity saves your lighting data as
Asset files in your project directory. This ensures that the data you need is
part of your build.
