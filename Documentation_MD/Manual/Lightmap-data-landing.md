Introduction to lighting data

# Lighting data

Resources for how Unity stores lighting data and visibility data for
lightmapping, **Light Probes** Light probes store information about how light
passes through space in your scene. A collection of light probes arranged
within a given space can improve lighting on moving objects and static LOD
scenery within that space. [More info](LightProbes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#LightProbe), and **Reflection Probes** A
rendering component that captures a spherical view of its surroundings in all
directions, rather like a camera. The captured image is then stored as a
Cubemap that can be used by objects with reflective materials. [More
info](class-ReflectionProbe.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#ReflectionProbe).

**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Introduction to lighting data](lighting-precomputed-data.html) | Understand how Unity stores lighting data and visibility data for lightmapping, Light Probes, and Reflection Probes.  
[Lighting Data Assets](LightmapSnapshot.html) | Learn about the asset Unity creates to store precomputed lighting data for a **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene).  
[GI cache](GICache.html)The cached intermediate files used when Unity
precomputes lighting data. Unity keeps this cache to speed up computation.
[More info](GICache.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GICache) | Learn about the internal data cache Unity uses to store intermediate files when it precomputes lighting data for lightmapping.  
[Lightmap data format](Lightmaps-TechnicalInformation.html) | Understand how Unity stores light intensity as textures during lightmapping, and learn about support for high dynamic range (HDR) **lightmaps** A pre-rendered texture that contains the effects of light sources on static objects in the scene. Lightmaps are overlaid on top of scene geometry to create the effect of lighting. [More info](Lightmapping.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Lightmap).  
[Light Probe data format](LightProbes-TechnicalInformation.html) | Understand how Unity stores light as spherical harmonics data in Light Probes.
