# Set the camera background with Clear Flags in the Built-In Render Pipeline

Each **Camera** A component which creates an image of a particular viewpoint
in your scene. The output is either drawn to the screen or captured as a
texture. [More info](CamerasOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Camera) stores color and depth information
when it renders its view. The portions of the screen that are not drawn in are
empty, and will display the **skybox** A special type of Material used to
represent skies. Usually six-sided. [More info](sky-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Skybox) by default. When you are using
multiple Cameras, each one stores its own color and depth information in
buffers, accumulating more data as each Camera renders. As any particular
Camera in your **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your
game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you
place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and
building your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene) renders its view, you can set the
**Clear Flags** to clear different collections of the buffer information. To
do this, choose one of the following four options:

## Skybox

This is the default setting. Any empty portions of the screen will display the
current Camera’s skybox. If the current Camera has no skybox set, it will
default to the skybox chosen in the [Lighting Window](lighting-window.html)
(menu: **Window** > **Rendering** > **Lighting**). It will then fall back to
the **Background Color**. Alternatively a [Skybox component](sky-landing.html)
can be added to the camera.

## Solid color

Any empty portions of the screen will display the current Camera’s
**Background Color**.

## Depth only

If you want to draw a player’s gun without letting it get clipped inside the
environment, set one Camera at **Depth** 0 to draw the environment, and
another Camera at **Depth** 1 to draw the weapon alone. Set the weapon
Camera’s **Clear Flags** to **depth only**. This will keep the graphical
display of the environment on the screen, but discard all information about
where each object exists in 3-D space. When the gun is drawn, the opaque parts
will completely cover anything drawn, regardless of how close the gun is to
the wall.

## Don’t clear

This mode does not clear either the color or the **depth buffer** A memory
store that holds the z-value depth of each pixel in an image, where the
z-value is the depth for each rendered pixel from the projection plane. [More
info](class-RenderTexture.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#depthbuffer). The result is that each frame is
drawn over the next, resulting in a smear-looking effect. This isn’t typically
used in games, and would more likely be used with a custom **shader** A
program that runs on the GPU. [More info](Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Shader).

Note that on some GPUs (mostly mobile GPUs), not clearing the screen might
result in the contents of it being undefined in the next frame. On some
systems, the screen may contain the previous frame image, a solid black
screen, or random colored **pixels** The smallest unit in a computer image.
Pixel size depends on your screen resolution. Pixel lighting is calculated at
every screen pixel. [More info](ShadowPerformance.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#pixel).
