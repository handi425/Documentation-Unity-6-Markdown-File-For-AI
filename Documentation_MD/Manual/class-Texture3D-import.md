# Create a 3D texture

A 3D texture is a bitmap image that contains information in three dimensions
rather than the standard two. 3D textures are commonly used to simulate
volumetric effects such as fog or smoke, to approximate a volumetric 3D
**mesh** The main graphics primitive of Unity. Meshes make up a large part of
your 3D worlds. Unity supports triangulated or Quadrangulated polygon meshes.
Nurbs, Nurms, Subdiv surfaces must be converted to polygons. [More
info](mesh.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Mesh), or to store animated textures and blend
between them.

To create a 3D texture, import a 2D texture with the following properties:

  * Flipbook format - a single 2D texture arranged as regular cells.
  * Maximum size of 2048 × 2048 × 2048 **pixels** The smallest unit in a computer image. Pixel size depends on your screen resolution. Pixel lighting is calculated at every screen pixel. [More info](ShadowPerformance.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#pixel).

The size of a 3D texture on disk and in memory increases quickly as its
resolution increases. For example, a 3D texture with
[`RGBAFloat`](../ScriptReference/TextureFormat.RGBAFloat.html) format, no
mipmaps, and a size of 32 × 32 × 32 pixels has a size of 512 KB (32 × 32 × 32
× 16 bytes) in memory. If you increase the resolution to 256 × 256 × 256
pixels, the size in memory becomes 256 MB (256 × 256 × 256 × 16 bytes).

Follow these steps to import:

  1. Import the texture into your project.
  2. In the **Project** window, select the texture asset. Unity displays the texture import settings in the ****Inspector** A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. [More info](UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Inspector)** window.

  3. In the **Inspector** window, set **Texture Shape** to **3D**.
  4. Set **Columns** and **Rows** to the appropriate values for your flipbook texture.
  5. Select **Apply**.

Unity adds a 3D texture slice for each cell in the texture.

The texture after you set **Texture Shape** to **2D** , **Columns** to **8** ,
and **Rows** to **8**.
