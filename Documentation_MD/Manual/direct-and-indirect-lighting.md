# Direct and indirect lighting

Resources on choosing whether Unity calculates **global illumination** A group
of techniques that model both direct and indirect lighting to provide
realistic lighting results.  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#globalillumination) in real time, or stores
baked lighting in a build.

**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Lighting data](Lightmap-data-landing.html) | Resources for how Unity stores lighting data and visibility data for lightmapping, **Light Probes** Light probes store information about how light passes through space in your scene. A collection of light probes arranged within a given space can improve lighting on moving objects and static LOD scenery within that space. [More info](LightProbes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#LightProbe), and **Reflection Probes** A
rendering component that captures a spherical view of its surroundings in all
directions, rather like a camera. The captured image is then stored as a
Cubemap that can be used by objects with reflective materials. [More
info](class-ReflectionProbe.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#ReflectionProbe).  
[Precalculating surface lighting with lightmaps](Lightmapping-landing.html) | Resources for improving performance by setting up Unity to do complicated lighting calculations ahead of time.  
[Precalculating indirect light with Light Probes](LightProbes-landing.html) | Resources and techniques for using Light Probes to store the light at specific points in a **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene).  
[Save and load lighting settings with Lightmap Parameters Assets](configure-with-lightmap-parameters-asset.html) | Create and assign lighting settings to scenes or **GameObjects** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject), for example to swap between
indoor and outdoor lighting.
