# Introduction to cubemaps

A **Cubemap** A collection of six square textures that can represent the
reflections in an environment or the skybox drawn behind your geometry. The
six squares form the faces of an imaginary cube that surrounds an object; each
face represents the view along the directions of the world axes (up, down,
left, right, forward and back). [More info](class-Cubemap-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Cubemap) is a collection of six square
textures that represent the reflections on an environment. The six squares
form the faces of an imaginary cube that surrounds an object; each face
represents the view along the directions of the world axes (up, down, left,
right, forward and back).

Cubemaps are often used to capture reflections or “surroundings” of objects;
for example [skyboxes](sky-landing.html) and [environment reflections](class-
ReflectionProbe.html) often use cubemaps.
