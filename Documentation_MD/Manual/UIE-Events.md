# Control behavior with events

UI Toolkit provides events that communicate user actions or notifications to
**visual elements** A node of a visual tree that instantiates or derives from
the C# [`VisualElement`](../ScriptReference/UIElements.VisualElement.html)
class. You can style the look, define the behaviour, and display it on screen
as part of the UI. [More info](UIE-VisualTree.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Visualelement). The **UI**(User Interface)
Allows a user to interact with your application. Unity currently supports
three UI systems. [More info](UI-system-compare.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#UI) Toolkit **event system** A way of sending
events to objects in the application based on input, be it keyboard, mouse,
touch, or custom input. The Event System consists of a few components that
work together to send events. [More info](UIE-Runtime-Event-System.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#EventSystem) shares the same terminology and
event naming as [HTML events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events).
