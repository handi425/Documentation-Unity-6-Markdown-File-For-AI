# 2D game perspectives reference

Decide what game perspective or viewpoint you want your game to have. The
following table describes the main types of 2D game perspective:

**Game perspective** | **Description**  
---|---  
Top-down | A 2D game that provides an overhead or bird’s-eye view of the action.  
Side-on | A 2D game where the character moves left or right (or up and down) and the screen scrolls with them. The perspective is from the side.  
Isometric and 2.5D (three-quarter view) | 2D games with isometric view simulate 3D geometry and a depth axis, but use an orthographic Camera instead of a perspective Camera. This gives the player a bird’s-eye view of the action. For information on orthographic and perspective Cameras, see [Cameras](CamerasOverview.html)A component which creates an image of a particular viewpoint in your scene. The output is either drawn to the screen or captured as a texture. [More info](CamerasOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Camera).  
2.5D (also known as three-quarter view) games are 2D games that use 3D
geometry for the environment and characters, but restrict the gameplay to two
dimensions. The 3D effect has a visual rather than functional purpose.  
  
Many sections of this guide are relevant for all game perspectives. For top-
down and side-on perspectives, the [Tilemap](./2d-game-creation-wokflow.html)A
GameObject that allows you to quickly create 2D levels using tiles and a grid
overlay. [More info](tilemaps/work-with-tilemaps/tilemap-reference.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Tilemap) and [9-slicing](./2d-game-creation-
wokflow.html) tools are especially useful for designing your levels. For
isometric, three-quarter view or 2.5D perspectives, the [Isometric
Tilemaps](./2d-game-creation-wokflow.html) tool is especially useful.
