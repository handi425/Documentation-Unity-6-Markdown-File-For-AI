Introduction to cubemaps

# Cubemaps

Resources for creating and using a collection of six square textures that
represent the reflections in an environment, and form an imaginary cube around
a **GameObject** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent
characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s
functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](class-
GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject).

**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Introduction to cubemaps](class-Cubemap-introduction.html) | Understand that a **cubemap** has six squares forming the faces of an imaginary cube that surrounds an object.  
[Create a cubemap](class-Cubemap-create.html) | Generate a cubemap from textures, or the contents of a **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene).  
[Create a cubemap array](class-CubemapArray-create.html) | Use a script to create a cubmap array.  
[Sample a cubemap array in a shader](class-CubemapArray-use-in-shader.html) | Sample a cubemap array in High-level **Shader** A program that runs on the GPU. [More info](Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Shader) Language (HLSL).  
[Preview a cubemap array](class-CubemapArray.html) | Use the Texture Settings Import window to check a cubemap.
