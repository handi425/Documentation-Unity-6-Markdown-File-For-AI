Introduction to primitive collider shapes

# Primitive collider shapes

Primitive **colliders** An invisible shape that is used to handle physical
collisions for an object. A collider doesn’t need to be exactly the same shape
as the object’s mesh - a rough approximation is often more efficient and
indistinguishable in gameplay. [More info](CollidersOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Collider) are defined by simple geometric
shapes with a low number of polygons. They match Unity’s [Primitive
Objects](PrimitiveObjects.html), which are built-in **GameObject** The
fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props,
scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined
by the Components attached to it. [More info](class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject) shapes.
