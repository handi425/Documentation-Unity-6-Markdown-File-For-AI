Introduction to physics articulations

# Articulations

A physics articulation is a set of [Articulation Bodies](physics-
articulations.html) organized in a logical tree, in which each parent-child
relationship reflects mutually constrained relative motion.

The main purpose of physics articulations is to provide a realistic physics
behavior for industrial and commercial non-gaming applications that involve
**joints** A physics component allowing a dynamic connection between Rigidbody
components, usually allowing some degree of movement such as a hinge. [More
info](Joints.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#joint). For example, they make it a lot easier
than the regular Joints to simulate robotic arms and kinematic chains.

You can configure articulations via the
[`ArticulationBody`](../ScriptReference/ArticulationBody.html) class, or the
corresponding [Articulation Body](class-ArticulationBody.html) component.
