fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props,
scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined

GameObjects.

Large, complex **scenes** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your
game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you
place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and
building your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)

the same position with each other or GameObjects with meshes or geometry that
overlap. The selection piercing menu lists all GameObjects that share the same
