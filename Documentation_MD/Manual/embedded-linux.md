# Embedded Linux

Embedded Linux is a compact version of Linux designed to use for embedded
devices and appliances. It provides features and services that support
building applications suited for embedded systems. Use this section to
familiarize yourself with setting up the Unity Editor for Embedded Linux. For
information on distributions, refer to [Embedded Linux
Distributions](https://elinux.org/Embedded_Linux_Distributions).

**Note:** The Unity Editor for Embedded Platforms is available under separate
terms. For download information and licensing, contact your Account Manager or
the [Unity Sales](https://create.unity.com/unity-for-industries) team.
