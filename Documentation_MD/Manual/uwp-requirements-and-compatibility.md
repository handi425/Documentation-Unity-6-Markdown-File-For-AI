# UWP requirements and compatibility

This page contains system requirements and compatibility information for
Universal Windows Platform (UWP) development in Unity.

## UWP application support

Unity supports four CPU architectures when targeting UWP:

  * x86
  * x64
  * ARM
  * ARM64

Unity supports the following operating system versions:

  * Windows 10+
  * HoloLens

Unity supports GPUs capable of running:

  * DX10
  * DX11
  * DX12

You need the following additional software to develop with UWP:

  * Windows 10+ SDK
  * Visual Studio 2019 (or later)

## Activate Windows Developer Mode

You need to activate Windows Developer Mode on your PC and any other testing
devices to be able to develop an application for UWP. When you open a UWP
project in Visual Studio for the first time, a dialog will open that instructs
you on how to select Developer Mode in your settings page. For more
information, refer to the Microsoft documentation on how to [enable your
device for development](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-
started/enable-your-device-for-development).

## Player log

You can locate the player log under
`<user>\AppData\Local\Packages\<productname>\TempState`. For more information,
refer to [log files](log-files.html).
