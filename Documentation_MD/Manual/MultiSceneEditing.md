# Work with multiple scenes in Unity

If you need to create large streaming worlds or want to effectively manage
multiple **scenes** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game.
Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place
your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and
building your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene) at runtime, you can open and edit
multiple scenes in the Unity Editor simultaneously. Having multiple scenes
open at once also lets you improve the workflow, especially if you often have
to edit scenes collaboratively.

[**Bake data in multiple scenes**](bakemultiplescenes.html) | How to bake **lightmaps** A pre-rendered texture that contains the effects of light sources on static objects in the scene. Lightmaps are overlaid on top of scene geometry to create the effect of lighting. [More info](Lightmapping.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Lightmap), **NavMesh** A mesh that Unity
generates to approximate the walkable areas and obstacles in your environment
for path finding and AI-controlled navigation. [More
info](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ai.navigation@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/NavInnerWorkings.html%23walkable-
areas)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#NavMesh) data, and **occlusion culling** A
process that disables rendering GameObjects that are hidden (occluded) from
the view of the camera. [More info](OcclusionCulling.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Occlusionculling) data in multiple scenes
simultaneously.  
[**Use scripts to edit multiple scenes**](scriptmultiplescenes.html) | How to edit multiple scenes with **scripts** A piece of code that allows you to create your own Components, trigger game events, modify Component properties over time and respond to user input in any way you like. [More info](creating-scripts.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scripts), through the Editor or at runtime.
