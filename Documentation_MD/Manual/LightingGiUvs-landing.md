Introduction to Lightmap UVs

# Lightmap UVs

Approaches and resources for creating and troubleshooting vertex coordinates
in **lightmaps** A pre-rendered texture that contains the effects of light
sources on static objects in the scene. Lightmaps are overlaid on top of scene
geometry to create the effect of lighting. [More info](Lightmapping.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Lightmap).

**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Introduction to lightmap UVs](LightingGiUvs.html) | Compare the differences between lightmap UVs in baked lightmaps and real-time lightmaps, and learn about how Unity calculates lightmap UVs.  
[Generate lightmap UVs](LightingGiUvs-GeneratingLightmappingUVs.html) | Generate lightmap UVs automatically, or provide your own.  
[Check lightmap UVs](LightingGiUvs-visualizing.html) | Use the Lighting window to check the UV layout of a **mesh** The main graphics primitive of Unity. Meshes make up a large part of your 3D worlds. Unity supports triangulated or Quadrangulated polygon meshes. Nurbs, Nurms, Subdiv surfaces must be converted to polygons. [More info](mesh.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Mesh).  
[Troubleshooting automatically generated lightmap UVs](LightingGiUVs-Troubleshooting.html) | Solve common issues with UVs that Unity automatically generates, including light bleeding.  
[Lightmap UVs Settings in the Model Import Settings Inspector window reference](LightingGiUvs-Reference.html) | Explore the properties and settings in the Model Import Settings **Inspector** A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. [More info](UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Inspector) window to customize how Unity
generates lightmap UVs.
