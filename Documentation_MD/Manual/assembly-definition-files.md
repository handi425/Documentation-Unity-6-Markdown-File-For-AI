Introduction to assemblies in Unity

# Organizing scripts into assemblies

Assemblies are individual units of compiled code that group types and
resources together. Organizing **scripts** A piece of code that allows you to
create your own Components, trigger game events, modify Component properties
over time and respond to user input in any way you like. [More info](creating-
scripts.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scripts) into assemblies has important
advantages, especially as your codebase grows.

Assemblies help you think clearly about the architecture of your code and
about managing dependencies. By exercising fine-grained control over
references, you can reduce unnecessary recompilation time and make your code
easier to debug.

**Topic** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Introduction to assemblies in Unity](assembly-definitions-intro.html) | Understand the fundamentals of how assemblies work in Unity and why using them to organize your scripts is beneficial.  
[Creating assembly assets](assembly-definitions-creating.html) | Create various kinds of assembly assets to customize your assemblies.  
[Referencing assemblies](assembly-definitions-referencing.html) | Set up references between assemblies, override the default references and understand the limitations Unity places on references.  
[Conditionally including assemblies](assembly-definition-includes.html) | Use scripting symbols to conditionally include or exclude assemblies from compilation.  
[Assembly metadata and compilation details](assembly-definition-metadata.html) | Define metadata for your assemblies.  
[Assembly Definition properties reference](class-AssemblyDefinitionImporter.html) | Inspector-editable properties of assembly defintion assets and their meaning.  
[Assembly Definition Reference properties reference](class-AssemblyDefinitionReferenceImporter.html) | Inspector-editable properties of assembly defintion reference assets and their meaning.  
[Assembly Definition file format reference](assembly-definition-file-format.html) | Assembly definition file format reference.

  * [Special folders and script compilation order](script-compile-order-folders.html)
  * [Scripting backends](scripting-backends.html)A framework that powers scripting in Unity. Unity supports three different scripting backends depending on target platform: Mono, .NET and IL2CPP. Universal Windows Platform, however, supports only two: .NET and IL2CPP. [More info](scripting-backends.html)
