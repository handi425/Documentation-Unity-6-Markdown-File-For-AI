# Configurations for embedded platforms

Unity supports embedded platform configurations through [embedded support
plans](https://unity.com/products/compare-plans/embedded).

When starting an embedded support plan, the chosen configuration will be fixed
and supported throughout the length of the support plan. Unity only supports
deployment to these embedded platforms with a valid embedded support plan. For
more information, contact your Account Manager or the [Unity
Sales](https://create.unity.com/unity-for-industries) team.

**Note:** For all configurations, usage of Unity for commercial embedded
systems is subject to the [Embedded Software
Restriction](https://unity.com/legal/terms-of-
service#:~:text=Embedded%20Software%20Restriction) in the Unity terms of
service.

## Verified configurations for embedded platforms

Verified embedded platform configurations are continuously tested and
confirmed to run Unity, using a publicly available board support package (BSP)
provided by the chipset or OS vendor. These are the only configurations
supported through the [Basic Embedded Support
plan](https://unity.com/products/compare-plans/embedded#:~:text=Basic).

**Vendor** | **Model** | **Verified OS/BSP**  
---|---|---  
**NVIDIA** | [Jetson TX2](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-tx2/) | Ubuntu for Tegra  
[Jetson AGX Xavier](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-agx-xavier/) | Ubuntu for Tegra  
[Jetson Orin](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-orin/) | Ubuntu for Tegra  
**NXP** | [I.MX8 QM](https://www.nxp.com/design/design-center/development-boards-and-designs/i-mx-evaluation-and-development-boards/i-mx-8quadmax-multisensory-enablement-kit-mek:MCIMX8QM-CPU) | Yocto Linux  
QNX 7.1  
Android Automotive 13  
Android Automotive 14  
**Raspberry Pi** | [Raspberry Pi 4b](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) | QNX 7.1 (Vulkan only)  
Yocto Linux  
[Raspberry Pi 5](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/) | Yocto Linux  
Raspberry Pi OS  
  
Unity supports OpenGL ES 3.0 and Vulkan 1.0.

**Note:** Performance of these configurations are hardware-dependent. On some
embedded configurations, the available **feature set** A feature set is a
collection of related packages that you can use to achieve specific results in
the Unity Editor. You can manage feature sets directly in Unity’s Package
Manager. [More info](FeatureSets.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Featureset) is limited.

## Other configurations

Specific versions of Unity have been verified to run on chipsets from AMD,
Intel, Mediatek, Qualcomm, Renesas, Rockchip, and Samsung. Support for these
chipsets is currently limited to a [Full Embedded Support
plan](https://unity.com/products/compare-plans/embedded#:~:text=Full).

If the dependencies and [system requirements](system-
requirements.html#embedded) are met, Unity can run on other configurations.
However, a [Full Embedded Support plan](https://unity.com/products/compare-
plans/embedded#:~:text=Full) is required to receive support.
