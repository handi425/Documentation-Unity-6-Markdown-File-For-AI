**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Introduction to the camera view](UnderstandingFrustum.html) | Learn about the shape of the region the camera views, including the view frustum and **clipping planes** A plane that limits how far or close a camera can see from its current position. A camera’s viewable range is between the far and near clipping planes. See far clipping plane and near clipping plane. [More info](class-Camera.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#clippingplane).  
[Make the camera perspective oblique](ObliqueFrustum.html) | Set the view frustum so that one side extends at a shallower angle, for example to increase the feeling of speed.  
[Calculate the size of the frustum at a distance](FrustumSizeAtDistance.html) | Get the size and shape of the frustum rectangle at a distance from the camera.  
[CameraRays](CameraRays.html) | Resources about calculating and using lines that point from the camera to positions in world space.
