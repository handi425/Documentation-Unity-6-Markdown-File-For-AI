# QNX

QNX is a commercial and real-time operating system much like a Unix-like
operating system. Use this section to familiarize yourself with setting up the
Unity Editor to run on devices that use QNX. For more information about the
QNX platform, refer to [QNX product
documentation](https://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/index.html).

**Note:** The Unity Editor for Embedded Platforms is available under separate
terms. For download information and licensing, contact your Account Manager or
the [Unity Sales](https://create.unity.com/unity-for-industries) team.
