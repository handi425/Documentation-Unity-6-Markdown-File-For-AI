Introduction to materials

# Materials

In Unity, you use materials and **shaders** A program that runs on the GPU.
[More info](Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Shader) together to define the appearance of
your **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think
of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your
environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building
your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene).

[Introduction to materials](materials-introduction.html) | Understand using materials to describe the appearance of surfaces.  
[Create and assign a material](create-material.html) | Create a material asset, and assign it to a **GameObject** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject).  
[Access material properties in a script](MaterialsAccessingViaScript.html) | Modify values on a material, change colours, and swap textures at runtime.  
[Material Variants](materialvariant-landingpage.html) | Resources on managing and maintaining large numbers of materials.  
[Material Validator in the Built-in Render Pipeline](materials-troubleshooting.html) | Resources on using the Material Validator in the Built-In **Render Pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) to check and fix values in
materials that are too large or small.  
[Material Inspector window reference](class-Material.html) | Explore the properties and settings in the Material **Inspector** A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. [More info](UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Inspector) window to change how a material
