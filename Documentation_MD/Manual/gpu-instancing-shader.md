GPU Instancing in the Built-In Render Pipeline

# Creating custom shaders that support GPU instancing in the Built-In Render
Pipeline

Resources for writing HLSL **shaders** A program that runs on the GPU. [More
info](Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Shader) or **Surface Shaders** A streamlined
way of writing shaders for the Built-in Render Pipeline. [More info](SL-
SurfaceShaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#SurfaceShader) in the Built-In **Render
Pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and
displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render
pipelines, or write your own. [More info](render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) that support GPU instancing.
