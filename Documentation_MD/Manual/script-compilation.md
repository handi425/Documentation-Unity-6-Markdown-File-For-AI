# Script compilation

This section contains information on how Unity compiles your **scripts** A
piece of code that allows you to create your own Components, trigger game
events, modify Component properties over time and respond to user input in any
way you like. [More info](creating-scripts.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scripts) and in what order.

**Topic** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Special folders](script-compile-order-folders.html) | Information about the reserved folder names in Unity, which have an effect on the order of script compilation.  
[Conditional compilation](conditional-compilation.html) | Use and define preprocessor directives to selectively include or exclude sections of your code for compilation.  
[Assembly definitions](assembly-definition-files.html) | Information about assembly definitions, which you can use to organize the scripts in your project.  
[Managed code stripping](managed-code-stripping.html) | Understand and configure managed code stripping, which removes unused code from a build and helps decrease the final build size of your application.
