Introduction to shaders

# Shaders

Resources for using or writing programs that run on the GPU to control the
appearance of objects in a **scene** A Scene contains the environments and
menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each
Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially
designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene).

[Introduction to shaders](shader-introduction.html) | Understand the different types of **shader** , and key terminology.  
[Built-in shaders](shader-built-in-landing.html) | Resources for the shaders Unity provides. Use built-in shaders to create a wide range of materials, from simple unlit colors to physically-based lit surfaces.  
[Writing custom shaders](writing-custom-shaders.html) | Resources for creating your own shaders using Shader Graph, or High-Level Shader Language (HLSL) and **ShaderLab** Unity’s language for defining the structure of Shader objects. [More info](SL-Shader.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#ShaderLab).  
[Optimize shaders](SL-ShaderPerformance.html) | Optimizing custom shaders for runtime performance, especially on mobile platforms that have limited GPU performance.  
[Shaders in URP](urp/shaders-in-universalrp.html) | Resources for using or writing shaders in the Universal **Render Pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) (URP).  
[Shaders in the Built-In Render Pipeline](shader-built-in-birp-landing.html) | Resources for using shaders in the Built-In Render Pipeline to create materials for real-world objects or particles.  
[Troubleshooting shaders](shader-troubleshooting.html) | Solve common issues with shaders, such as hitches and stalls, or large build sizes.  
[Shader languages reference](shaders-reference.html) | Reference for ShaderLab, and High Level Shader Language (HLSL) in Unity.
