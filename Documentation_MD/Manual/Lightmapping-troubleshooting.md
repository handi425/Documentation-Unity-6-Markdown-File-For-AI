Smooth hard edges in lightmaps

# Troubleshooting baked lightmaps

Solve common issues with baked **lightmaps** A pre-rendered texture that
contains the effects of light sources on static objects in the scene.
Lightmaps are overlaid on top of scene geometry to create the effect of
lighting. [More info](Lightmapping.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Lightmap), such as hard edges or light
bleeding.

**Page** | **Description**

[Smooth hard edges in lightmaps](Lightmapping-SeamStitching.html) | Use seam stitching to smooth unwanted hard edges in **GameObjects** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject).  
[Fix light bleeding in lightmaps](ProgressiveLightmapper-UVOverlap.html) | Add space between surfaces in lightmaps, to avoid issues such as aliasing and pixelation.
