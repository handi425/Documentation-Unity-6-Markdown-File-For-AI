Profile the Unity Editor process to understand how the Editor process affects

**Tip:** To reduce the impact that the **Profiler** A window that helps you to
optimize your game. It shows how much time is spent in the various areas of
your game. For example, it can report the percentage of time spent rendering,
animating, or in your game logic. [More info](Profiler.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Profiler) window has on Editor performance,
open the Profiler window in its own process with the [Standalone
Profiler](profiler-standalone-process.html). The Standalone Profiler is useful
because the Profiler window itself uses resources that might skew the
performance data.

## Profile the Editor’s startup times

To profile the Editor’s startup times, start the Editor with the command line
option `-profiler-enable`. Refer to [Profiler command line
arguments](profiler-command-line-arguments.html) for more information.
