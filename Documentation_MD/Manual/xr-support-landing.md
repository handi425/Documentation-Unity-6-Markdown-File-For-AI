# Overview

Unity supports **XR** An umbrella term encompassing Virtual Reality (VR),
Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality (MR) applications. Devices supporting
these forms of interactive applications can be referred to as XR devices.
[More info](XR.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#XR) development on multiple platforms and
devices through its XR **plug-in** A set of code created outside of Unity that
creates functionality in Unity. There are two kinds of plug-ins you can use in
Unity: Managed plug-ins (managed .NET assemblies created with tools like
Visual Studio) and Native plug-ins (platform-specific native code libraries).
[More info](./plug-ins.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Plug-in) framework. Unity also provides a set
of packages that add features and developer tools for building XR games and
applications. This section provides an overview of the supported platforms and
describes the software architecture behind the XR plug-in framework.
