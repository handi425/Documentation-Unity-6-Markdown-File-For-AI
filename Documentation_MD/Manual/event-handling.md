# Handling events

Events are an important concept in Unity projects. For example, user inputs,
**collisions** A collision occurs when the physics engine detects that the
colliders of two GameObjects make contact or overlap, when at least one has a
Rigidbody component and is in motion. [More info](CollidersOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Collision) between characters, and stages of
the physics or rendering loops are all things a game typically needs to
respond to. In addition to the standard .NET APIs for [handling and raising
events in C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/events/),
Unity provides a range of Unity-specific APIs for events.

**Topic** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Event functions (predefined callbacks)](event-functions.html) | Event functions are a set of built-in callbacks which you can implement on your MonoBehaviour-derived **scripts** A piece of code that allows you to create your own Components, trigger game events, modify Component properties over time and respond to user input in any way you like. [More info](creating-scripts.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scripts) to respond to core Engine events
related to physics, rendering, input, **scene** A Scene contains the
environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a
unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and
decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More
info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene) loading and object lifecycles.  
[Execution order of event functions](execution-order.html) | Understand the execution order of Unity’s built-in event functions so you can respond to events and update the state of your game in the right order.  
[Inspector-configurable custom events](unity-events.html) | Create your own custom events for which you can configure persistent (lasting between Edit mode and Play mode) callbacks in the **Inspector** A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. [More info](UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Inspector) window.
