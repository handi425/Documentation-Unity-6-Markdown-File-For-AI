Introduction to the Frame Timing Manager

# Frame Timing Manager

Resources for using the Frame Timing Manager window to capture detailed timing
data about performance during individual frames in an application. You can use
this data to assess those frames to understand why your application doesn’t
meet performance targets.

[Introduction to the Frame Timing Manager](frame-timing-manager.html) | Learn about how the Frame Timing Manager works, and which platforms it supports.  
[Enable the Frame Timing Manager](frame-timing-manager-enable.html) | Enable the Frame Timing Manager in release builds and the Unity Editor.  
[Get frame timing data](frame-timing-manager-get-timing-data.html) | Get frame time data with a Custom Profiler module, or using the `FrameTimingManager` C# API.  
[Record frame timing data](frame-timing-manager-record-timing-data.html) | Get frame time data using the `ProfilerRecorder` instead of the `FrameTimingManager` API.  
[Troubleshooting the Frame Timing Manager](frame-timing-manager-troubleshoot.html) | Solve common issues with the Frame Timing Manager, such as larger GPU times than frame times on platforms that use tile-based architecture.  
  
## Additional resources

  * [Profiler](Profiler.html)A window that helps you to optimize your game. It shows how much time is spent in the various areas of your game. For example, it can report the percentage of time spent rendering, animating, or in your game logic. [More info](Profiler.html)
