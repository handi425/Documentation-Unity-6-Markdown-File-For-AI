Understanding build types

# Build profiles

Unity can build your application for different platforms with unique build
configurations using **build profiles** A set of customizable configuration
settings to use when creating a build for your target platform. [More
info](build-profiles.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Buildprofile).

**Note** : Build profiles were previously called Build Settings.

[Introduction to build profiles](build-profiles.html) | Introduces build profiles and the profile types.  
[Create a build profile](create-build-profile.html) | Use the **Build Profiles** window to create multiple build configurations.  
[Manage scenes in your build](build-profile-scene-list.html) | Add, exclude, remove, and reorder **scenes** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene) in your build.  
[Override Player settings with build profiles](override-player-settings.html) | Override platform **Player settings** Settings that let you set various player-specific options for the final game built by Unity. [More info](class-PlayerSettings.html)
