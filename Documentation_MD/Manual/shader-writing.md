Introduction to writing shaders in code

# Writing shaders in code

This section contains information on the following subjects:

**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Introduction to writing shaders in code](SL-ShadingLanguage.html) | Learn about **ShaderLab** Unity’s language for defining the structure of Shader objects. [More info](SL-Shader.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#ShaderLab), **Surface Shaders** A streamlined
way of writing shaders for the Built-in Render Pipeline. [More info](SL-
SurfaceShaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#SurfaceShader), and High Level **Shader** A
program that runs on the GPU. [More info](Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Shader) Language (HLSL), and which languages
and approaches to use for each **render pipeline** A series of operations that
take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you
choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](render-
pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Renderpipeline).  
[Shader object fundamentals](shader-objects.html) | Understand the object that Unity uses as a wrapper for shader programs and other information.  
[Writing a custom shader in ShaderLab and HLSL](SL-landing.html) | Resources and techniques for writing **Shader objects** An instance of the Shader class, a Shader object is container for shader programs and GPU instructions, and information that tells Unity how to use them. Use them with materials to determine the appearance of your scene. [More info](shader-objects.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Shaderobject), subshaders and shader passes in
ShaderLab and HLSL.  
[Adding material properties to shaders](writing-shader-change-properties.html) | Resources and techniques for adding properties that artists can use to create, edit, and share materials with different configurations.  
[Change how shaders work via branching and keywords](SL-MultipleProgramVariants.html) | Resources and techniques for writing shader code so it uses conditionals to do different things under different circumstances.  
[Configure if or when Unity uses a shader](writing-shader-tags.html) | Resources for using tags and blocks in a shader to configure how and when Unity uses the shader.
