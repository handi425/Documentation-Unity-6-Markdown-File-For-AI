# Decals in the Built-In Render Pipeline

Techniques for using a Projector component to project materials onto other
**GameObjects** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent
characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s
functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](class-
GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject) in the Built-In **Render
Pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and
displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render
pipelines, or write your own. [More info](render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Renderpipeline).
