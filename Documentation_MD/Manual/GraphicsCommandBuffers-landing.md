CommandBuffer fundamentals in the Built-In Render Pipeline

# Custom rendering in the Built-In Render Pipeline

Resources for using the `CommandBuffer` API to schedule and execute rendering
commands at various points in the Built-in **Render Pipeline** A series of
operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen.
Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own.
[More info](render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Renderpipeline). This allows you to customize
and extend Unity’s rendering functionality

**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Command buffer fundamentals](GraphicsCommandBuffers.html) | Understand how a `CommandBuffer` object holds a list of rendering commands that you can schedule and execute at various points in the Built-in Render Pipeline.  
[CameraEvent and LightEvent events order reference](GraphicsCommandBuffers-order.html) | Explore the **camera** A component which creates an image of a particular viewpoint in your scene. The output is either drawn to the screen or captured as a texture. [More info](CamerasOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Camera) and light events you can use to
schedule rendering commands at a specific time.
