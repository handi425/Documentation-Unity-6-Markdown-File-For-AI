Usage and Performance of Built-in Shaders

# Legacy prebuilt shaders

Prior to the introduction of the [Physically Based Standard Shader](shader-
StandardShader.html), Unity was supplied with more than eighty built-in
shaders which each served different purposes. These shaders are still included
and available for use in Unity for backwards compatibility but we recommend
you use the Standard **Shader** A program that runs on the GPU. [More
info](Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Shader) wherever possible for new projects.

This section begins by explaining how to use the legacy built-in shaders to
maximum effect. The remainder of the section details all the available
shaders, grouped into related “families”.
