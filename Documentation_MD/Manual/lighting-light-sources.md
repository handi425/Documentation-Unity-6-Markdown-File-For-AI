# Light sources

Resources for adding light to a **scene** A Scene contains the environments
and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In
each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations,
essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More
info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene), with Light components, **ambient
light** Light that doesn’t come from any specific direction, and contributes
equal light in all directions to the Scene. [More info](lighting-window.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Ambientlight), and cookies.
