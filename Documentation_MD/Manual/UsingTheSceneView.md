environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building
your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)

interact with the world you create in the Editor. In the **Scene view** , you
can select, manipulate, and modify **GameObjects** The fundamental object in
Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras,
waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components
attached to it. [More info](class-GameObject.html)
