# Use your native plug-in for iOS

Enable your iOS project to use your native **plug-in** A set of code created
outside of Unity that creates functionality in Unity. There are two kinds of
plug-ins you can use in Unity: Managed plug-ins (managed .NET assemblies
created with tools like Visual Studio) and Native plug-ins (platform-specific
native code libraries). [More info](./plug-ins.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Plug-in).

To use your **native plug-in** A platform-specific native code library that is
created outside of Unity for use in Unity. Allows you can access features like
OS calls and third-party code libraries that would otherwise not be available
to Unity. [More info](./plug-ins.html)

must ensure you configure your project appropriately:
