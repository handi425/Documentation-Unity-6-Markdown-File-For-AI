Introduction to GameObjects

# Working with GameObjects

The following topics give an overview of how to work with **GameObjects** The
fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props,
scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined
by the Components attached to it. [More info](class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject) in Unity:

**Topic** | **Description**  
---|---  
**[Introduction](GameObjects.html)** | Learn more about GameObjects in Unity.  
**[Unity attributes](unity-attributes.html)** | An overview of Unity attributes.  
**[Primitive and placeholder objects](PrimitiveObjects.html)** | Information about primitive objects.  
**[Components](tableComponents) A functional part of a GameObject. A
GameObject can contain any number of components. Unity has many built-in
components, and you can create your own by writing scripts that inherit from
MonoBehaviour. [More info](UsingComponents.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#component)** | An overview of components.  
**[Models](models.html) A 3D model representation of an object, such as a
character, a building, or a piece of furniture. [More info](3D-formats.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Model)** | An overview of models.  
**[Meshes](mesh.html)** | Learn more about meshes.  
**[Prefabs](Prefabs.html) An asset type that allows you to store a GameObject
complete with components and properties. The prefab acts as a template from
which you can create new object instances in the scene. [More
info](Prefabs.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Prefab)** | Information about prefabs.  
**[Constraints](Constraints.html) Settings on Joint components which limit
movement or rotation. The type and number of constraints vary depending on the
type of Joint. [More info](2d-physics/joints/2d-joints-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Constraints)** | An overview of constraints.
