# Introduction to decals and projection

Decals are materials that decorate the surface of other materials. They are
most commonly used for effects like paint splatters and stickers.

Unity projects these materials into a **scene** A Scene contains the
environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a
unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and
decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More
info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene) so that they wrap around other scene
geometry. This means that you can also use them for effects that simulate
projected light, such as blob shadows.
