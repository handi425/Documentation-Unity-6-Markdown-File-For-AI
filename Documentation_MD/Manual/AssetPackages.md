Create and export asset packages

# Asset packages

Asset packages are collections of files and data from Unity projects, or
elements of projects, which Unity compresses and stores in one file with the
`.unitypackage` extension. Like a zip file, an **asset package** maintains its
original directory structure when it’s unpacked. An an asset package also has
metadata about assets, such as import settings and links to other assets.

The asset package format is one of the package types supported by the **Asset
Store** A growing library of free and commercial assets created by Unity and
members of the community. Offers a wide variety of assets, from textures,
models and animations to whole project examples, tutorials and Editor
extensions. [More info](AssetStore.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#AssetStore).

To create your own custom asset package, use the **Assets** Any media or data
that can be used in your game or project. An asset may come from a file
created outside of Unity, such as a 3D Model, an audio file or an image. You
can also create some asset types in Unity, such as an Animator Controller, an
Audio Mixer or a Render Texture. [More info](AssetWorkflow.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Asset) > **Export Package** menu option to
compress a collection of assets in your current Unity project. For more
information, refer to [Creating your own Asset
packages](AssetPackagesCreate.html).

To import a local custom asset package into your project, use the **Assets** >
**Import Package** menu option to unpack the collection into your currently
open Unity project. For more information, refer to [Importing Asset
packages](AssetPackagesImport.html).

To remove a local custom asset package from your project, use the **Project
window** A window that shows the contents of your `Assets` folder (Project
tab) [More info](ProjectView.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Projectwindow). For more information, refer to
[Removing local asset packages](upm-ui-remove-local.html).
