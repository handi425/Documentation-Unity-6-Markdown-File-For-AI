# Set up your environment for UWP

To create a Unity application for Universal Windows Platform (UWP), you first
need to set up your Unity project to support UWP. To support UWP, a Unity
project requires the **UWP Build Support** module.

Before you get started, check [UWP Requirements and compatibility](uwp-
requirements-and-compatibility.html) to make sure you’re aware of any
limitations for developing a Unity application for this platform.

## Install dependencies

Unity distributes dependencies as
[modules](https://docs.unity3d.com/hub/manual/AddModules.html) which means you
use the [Unity Hub](https://docs.unity3d.com/hub/manual/index.html) to install
them. The module you need is **UWP Build Support**. You can install it either
when you install a new Unity Editor version, or add it to an existing Unity
Editor install. To install modules:

  * At install time, refer to [Downloading and installing Editors and modules with the Unity Hub](https://docs.unity3d.com/hub/manual/InstallEditors.html).
  * To an existing install, refer to [Add modules](https://docs.unity3d.com/hub/manual/AddModules.html).
