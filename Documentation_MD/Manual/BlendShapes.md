# Work with blend shapes

## Prepare the artwork

Once you have set up blend shapes in your 3D modeling application, do the
following:

  1. In your 3D modeling application, enable these export settings: 
     * Enable exporting animation.
     * Enable exporting blend shapes for deformed models.
  2. Export your selection to an .fbx file.
  3. [Import your FBX file](ImportingModelFiles.html) into Unity.
  4. Select the newly imported Model in the Hierarchy window. The **Inspector** A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. [More info](UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Inspector) window displays the **BlendShapes**
section containing all the blend shapes under the [SkinnedMeshRenderer](class-
SkinnedMeshRenderer.html) component.

  5. For each listed blend shape, you can change its influence (weighting) to the default shape, where:
  6. `0` means the blend shape has no influence.
  7. `100` means the blend shape has full influence.

## Create animations In Unity

To create a blend animation:

  1. Open the Animation window (from the main Unity menu: **Window** > **Animation** > **Animation**).
  2. Select the **Animation Clip** Animation data that can be used for animated characters or simple animations. It is a simple “unit” piece of motion, such as (one specific instance of) “Idle”, “Walk” or “Run”. [More info](class-AnimationClip.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#AnimationClip) where you want to add the blend
shape animation. You can select **Create New Clip** to create a new Animation
Clip.

  3. Click **Add Property** and select **[Your Character]** > **[Your Character Body]** > **Skinned Mesh Renderer** and select the blend shape you want to animate.
  4. Select the added blend shape property, adjusting the **keyframes** A frame that marks the start or end point of a transition in an animation. Frames in between the keyframes are called inbetweens.  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#keyframe) and blend weights, and set
keyframes.

To preview your animation, click **Play** in the Editor window or the
Animation window.

## Scripting access

You can also set the blend weights through scripting using functions like
[GetBlendShapeWeight](../ScriptReference/SkinnedMeshRenderer.GetBlendShapeWeight.html)
and
[SetBlendShapeWeight](../ScriptReference/SkinnedMeshRenderer.SetBlendShapeWeight.html).

To check how many blend shapes a **Mesh** The main graphics primitive of
Unity. Meshes make up a large part of your 3D worlds. Unity supports
triangulated or Quadrangulated polygon meshes. Nurbs, Nurms, Subdiv surfaces
must be converted to polygons. [More info](mesh.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Mesh) has, use the
[blendShapeCount](../ScriptReference/Mesh-blendShapeCount.html) variable.

This code example demonstrates how to blend a default shape into two other
blend shapes over time when attached to a **GameObject** The fundamental
object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery,
cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the
Components attached to it. [More info](class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject) with three or more blend shapes:

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;
    
    public class BlendShapeExample : MonoBehaviour
    {
        int blendShapeCount;
        SkinnedMeshRenderer skinnedMeshRenderer;
        Mesh skinnedMesh;
        float blendOne = 0f;
        float blendTwo = 0f;
        float blendSpeed = 1f;
        bool blendOneFinished = false;
    
        void Awake ()
        {
            skinnedMeshRenderer = GetComponent<SkinnedMeshRenderer> ();
            skinnedMesh = GetComponent<SkinnedMeshRenderer> ().sharedMesh;
        }
    
        void Start ()
        {
            blendShapeCount = skinnedMesh.blendShapeCount;
        }
    
        void Update ()
        {
            if (blendShapeCount > 2) {
                if (blendOne < 100f) {
                    skinnedMeshRenderer.SetBlendShapeWeight (0, blendOne);
                    blendOne += blendSpeed;
                } else {
                    blendOneFinished = true;
                }
    
                if (blendOneFinished == true && blendTwo < 100f) {
                    skinnedMeshRenderer.SetBlendShapeWeight (1, blendTwo);
                    blendTwo += blendSpeed;
                }
            }
        }
    }
