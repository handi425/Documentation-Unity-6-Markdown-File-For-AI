# Introduction to asynchronous programming with Awaitable

The [`Awaitable`](../ScriptReference/Awaitable.html) class is a custom Unity
type that can be awaited and used as an async return type in the C#
asynchronous programming model. Most of Unity’s asynchronous APIs support the
`async` and `await` pattern, including:

  * Unity coroutines: [`NextFrameAsync`](../ScriptReference/Awaitable.NextFrameAsync.html), [`WaitForSecondsAsync`](../ScriptReference/Awaitable.WaitForSecondsAsync.html), [`EndOfFrameAsync`](../ScriptReference/Awaitable.EndOfFrameAsync.html), [`FixedUpdateAsync`](../ScriptReference/Awaitable.FixedUpdateAsync.html)
  * Switching to [Background Thread](../ScriptReference/Awaitable.BackgroundThreadAsync.html) or [Main Thread](../ScriptReference/Awaitable.MainThreadAsync.html)
  * All types inheriting from [`AsyncOperation`](../ScriptReference/AsyncOperation.html)
  * [Unity Events](unity-events.html)
  * [Async GPU Readback](../ScriptReference/Rendering.AsyncGPUReadback.html)

You can use the `Awaitable` class with both the `await` operator and as an
`async` return type in your own code, as follows:

    
    
    async Awaitable<List<Achievement>> GetAchievementsAsync()
    {
        var apiResult = await SomeMethodReturningATask(); // or any await-compatible type
        List<Achievement> achievements = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<List<Achievement>>(apiResult);
        return achievements;
    }
    
    async Awaitable ShowAchievementsView()
    {
        ShowLoadingOverlay();
        List<Achievement> achievements = await GetAchievementsAsync();
        HideLoadingOverlay();
        ShowAchivementsList(achievements);
    }
    

## Awaitable compared to .NET Task

`Awaitable` is designed to offer a more efficient alternative to .NET
[`Task`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-
us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.task?view=net-8.0) for asynchronous code
in Unity projects. The efficiency of `Awaitable` comes with some important
limitations compared to `Task`.

The most significant limitation is that `Awaitable` instances are pooled to
limit allocations. Consider the following example:

    
    
    class SomeMonoBehaviorWithAwaitable : MonoBehavior
    {
        public async void Start()
        {
            while(true)
            {
                // do some work on each frame
                await Awaitable.NextFrameAsync();
            }
        }
    }
    

Without pooling, each instance of the [`MonoBehavior`](class-
monobehaviour.html) in this example would allocate an `Awaitable` object each
frame, increasing [garbage collector workload](performance-garbage-
collector.html) and degrading performance. To mitigate this, Unity returns the
`Awaitable` object to the internal `Awaitable` pool once it’s been awaited.

**Important:** The pooling of `Awaitable` instances means it’s never safe to
`await` more than once on an `Awaitable` instance. Doing so can result in
undefined behavior such as an exception or a deadlock.

## Awaitable compared to .NET ValueTask

The .NET [`ValueTask<TResult>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-
us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.valuetask-1?view=net-8.0) offers some of
the same key benefits and limitations of `Awaitable`. The typical recommended
use for `ValueTask` is for asynchronous workloads that are expected to
complete synchronously most of the time. For more information, refer to
[Understanding the Whys, Whats, and Whens of
ValueTask](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/understanding-the-whys-whats-
and-whens-of-valuetask/).

## Awaitable, Task, and ValueTask summary

The following table summarizes the feature comparison between Unity’s
`Awaitable` class and .NET `Task` and `ValueTask`:

**Feature** | `Task` | `ValueTask` | `UnityEngine.Awaitable`  
---|---|---|---  
**Required allocations** |  **Many**.   
Allocates on every call to a `Task`-returning method, increasing memory use and garbage collector workload. |  **As-needed**.   
Can be optimized with pooling. |  **Minimal as-needed**.   
Calling an `Awaitable`-returning method usually doesn’t allocate memory, since
`Awaitable` instances are pooled by default.  
**Safe to await multiple times** |  **Yes**. |  **No**.   
Must convert to a `Task` with `ValueTask.AsTask`. |  **No**.   
Must convert to a `Task` with custom `AsTask` extension methods, refer to
[Awaiting multiple times in the same method](async-awaitable-
examples.html#await-multiple-times) in the code examples reference.  
**Continuations run asynchronously** |  **Yes**.   
Using the synchronization context by default, otherwise using the `ThreadPool`. This increases latency when completing on the main thread in Unity because code must wait until the next frame `Update` to resume. |  **Yes**.   
Optimized for the case where awaited tasks complete synchronously. If they complete asynchronously, the continuation behavior is equivalent to `Task`. |  **No**.   
Continuation runs synchronously when completion is triggered, meaning code
resumes immediately in the same frame in which completion is triggered. Refer
to [Awaitable completion and continuation](async-awaitable-continuations.html)
for more information.  
**Completion can be triggered by code** |  **Yes**.   
Using [`TaskCompletionSource`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.taskcompletionsource?view=net-8.0). | Not applicable in the typical use case, which is for tasks that mostly complete synchronously. |  **Yes**.   
Using
[`AwaitableCompletionSource`](../ScriptReference/AwaitableCompletionSource.html).  
**Can return a value** |  **Yes**.   
Using [`Task<TResult>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.task-1?view=net-8.0). |  **Yes**.   
Using [`ValueTask<TResult>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.valuetask-1?view=net-8.0). |  **Yes**.   
Using [`UnityEngine.Awaitable<T>`](../ScriptReference/Awaitable_1.html).  
**Built-in support for`WaitAll` and `WaitAny`** |  **Yes**. |  **No**.   
Must convert to `Task` with `ValueTask.AsTask`. |  **No**.   
Must convert to a `Task` with custom `AsTask` extension methods, refer to
[Wrapping Awaitable in .NET Task](async-awaitable-examples.html#awaitable-as-
task) in the code examples reference.  
**Unity thread and update loop-aware execution scheduling** |  **No**. |  **No**. |  **Yes**.   
You can specify which thread an `Awaitable` resumes on with
[`Awaitable.BackgroundThreadAsync`](../ScriptReference/Awaitable.BackgroundThreadAsync.html)
and
[`Awaitable.MainThreadAsync`](../ScriptReference/Awaitable.MainThreadAsync.html).
You can also schedule work relative to the `Update` or `FixedUpdate` loops
with
[`Awaitable.NextFrameAsync`](../ScriptReference/Awaitable.NextFrameAsync.html)
and
[`Awaitable.FixedUpdateAsync`](../ScriptReference/Awaitable.FixedUpdateAsync.html).
For more information, refer to [Awaitable completion and continuation](async-
awaitable-continuations.html).  
  
## When to use Awaitable over Task or ValueTask

The choice of API depends on the performance profile of your asynchronous
code, but in general:

  * `Task` is the only choice when you need to await multiple times or from several consumers concurrently.
  * `ValueTask` is a good choice if you have high-throughput asynchronous code that completes synchronously most of the time.
  * `Awaitable` is a good choice when: 
    * You don’t need to await your methods multiple times and expect them to mostly complete asynchronously.
    * You want your asynchronous tasks to have built-in support for Unity-specific concepts like the main thread and the [Update](time-per-frame-updates.html) and [FixedUpdate](fixed-updates.html) loops.

## Awaitable compared to iterator-based coroutines

`Awaitable` coroutines are usually more efficient than iterator-based
coroutines, especially for cases where the iterator returns non-null values,
such as [`WaitForFixedUpdate`](../ScriptReference/WaitForFixedUpdate.html).

However, the performance advantage of `Awaitable` coroutines reduces when you
run many of them concurrently. For example, a MonoBehaviour such as the one in
the previous code example, which awaits
[`Awaitable.NextFrameAsync`](../ScriptReference/Awaitable.NextFrameAsync.html)
in a `while` loop, is likely to cause performance problems if attached to
every **GameObject** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can
represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A
GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More
