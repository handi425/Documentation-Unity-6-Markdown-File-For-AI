# Overlays

In the **Scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game.
Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place
your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and
building your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene) view, authoring tools are available as
persistent, customizable panels and **toolbars** A row of buttons and basic
controls at the top of the Unity Editor that allows you to interact with the
Editor in various ways (e.g. scaling, translation). [More info](Toolbar.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Toolbar) called overlays. Overlays can also
display contextual information about your selection.

To improve your workflow, you can position overlays, select which overlays to
display or hide, and save, import, or export overlay configurations.

‍To check which overlays are available in the **Scene view** An interactive
view into the world you are creating. You use the Scene View to select and
position scenery, characters, cameras, lights, and all other types of Game
Object. [More info](UsingTheSceneView.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#SceneView), press the **`** key to open the
Overlay menu. You can also open the Overlay menu from the **More** (⋮) menu in
the top right corner of the Scene view.
