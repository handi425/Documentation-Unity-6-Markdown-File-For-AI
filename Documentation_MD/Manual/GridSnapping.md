# Scene view grid snapping

You can use the visual grid in the **Scene** A Scene contains the environments
and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In
each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations,

The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props,
scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined

ways. You can choose which color the grid displays in, which axis to display
