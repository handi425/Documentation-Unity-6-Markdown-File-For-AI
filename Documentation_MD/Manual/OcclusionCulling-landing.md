Occlusion culling

# Excluding hidden objects with occlusion culling

Resources about preventing Unity doing rendering calculations for hidden
**GameObjects** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent
characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s
functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](class-
GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject).

**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Occlusion culling](OcclusionCulling.html)A process that disables rendering
GameObjects that are hidden (occluded) from the view of the camera. [More
info](OcclusionCulling.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Occlusionculling) | Understand how occlusion culling checks for hidden objects, and when to use it.  
[Set up a scene for occlusion culling](occlusion-culling-getting-started.html) | Set up a **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene) for occlusion culling, bake occlusion
culling data, and check the results.  
[Set up multiple scenes for occlusion culling](occlusion-culling-scene-loading.html) | Prepare occlusion culling data differently if you load multiple scenes at a time.  
[Cull moving GameObjects](occlusion-culling-dynamic-gameobjects.html) | Enable or disable Dynamic Occlusion.  
[Create high-precision occlusion areas](class-OcclusionArea.html) | Use the Occlusion Area component to define an area where Unity calculates culling more precisely.  
[Control occlusion in areas with Occlusion Portals](class-OcclusionPortal.html) | Turn occlusion on and off through an object, for example a door that opens and closes.  
[Occlusion Culling window reference](occlusion-culling-window.html) | Explore the properties and settings in the Occlusion Culling window to customize how culling works.  
[Configure culling with the CullingGroup API](CullingGroupAPI-landing.html) | Integrate your own systems into Unity’s culling and **level of detail** The _Level Of Detail_ (LOD) technique is an optimization that reduces the number of triangles that Unity has to render for a GameObject when its distance from the Camera increases. [More info](LevelOfDetail.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#levelofdetail) (LOD) pipelines.
