Universal Render Pipeline compatibility in XR

# XR graphics

Graphics and rendering in an **XR** An umbrella term encompassing Virtual
Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality (MR) applications.
Devices supporting these forms of interactive applications can be referred to
as XR devices. [More info](XR.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#XR) app follow the same principles as they do
in any Unity application, with some differences arising from the need for
stereo rendering and increased efficiency.

XR apps generally require very high and consistent frame rates for user
comfort. At the same time, rendering in stereo means that every visible object
must be drawn twice from different perspectives. Techniques like single-pass
rendering can improve rendering efficiency by reducing the duplication of
effort, but also require changes to **shader** A program that runs on the GPU.
[More info](Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Shader) code.
