# Position an overlay

Move overlays in the **Scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of
your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene,
you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing
and building your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene) view to organize your workspace.

Overlays can float or dock to the edges or corners of the **Scene view** An
interactive view into the world you are creating. You use the Scene View to
select and position scenery, characters, cameras, lights, and all other types
of Game Object. [More info](UsingTheSceneView.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#SceneView).

If you want to save your overlay configuration, refer to [Create and manage
overlay configurations](manage-overlay-configurations.html).

## Move overlays

Put overlays anywhere in the Scene view.

To move an overlay in the Scene view:

  1. Click and hold the handle (**=**) of the overlay you want to move.
  2. Drag the overlay to move it.

**Note:** Overlays that float in the Scene view can overlap each other. Select
an overlay to bring it to the front.

## Dock overlays

Overlays can dock to the top, bottom, sides, and corners of the Scene view.

You can dock more than one overlay to the same edge or corner of the Scene
view. However, multiple overlays docked to the same edge or corner are not
connected with each other. If you move a docked overlay, other overlays docked
to the same location do not move.

Expanded overlays that dock to the top or bottom of the Scene view display in
the [horizontal layout](manage-overlay-layouts.html). Expanded overlays that
dock to sides of the Scene view display in the [vertical layout](manage-
overlay-layouts.html).

Overlays that aren’t **toolbars** A row of buttons and basic controls at the
top of the Unity Editor that allows you to interact with the Editor in various
ways (e.g. scaling, translation). [More info](Toolbar.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Toolbar) [collapse](manage-overlay-
layouts.html#expand-an-overlay) when they dock to an edge of the Scene view.
For example, the [Orientation](SceneViewNavigation.html#gizmo) overlay
collapses when it docks. Click the down arrow to access a collapsed overlay’s
options.

To dock an overlay in the Scene view:

  1. Click and hold the handle (**=**) of the overlay you want to dock.
  2. Drag the overlay to a corner or edge of the Scene view. If the overlay can dock, the corner or edge highlights in blue.
  3. Release the overlay.
