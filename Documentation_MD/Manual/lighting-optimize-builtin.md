# Optimize lighting in the Built-In Render Pipeline

To optimize the lights in your **scene** A Scene contains the environments and
menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each
Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially
designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene), avoid Unity using multiple render
passes to render **GameObjects** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which
can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A
GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More
info](class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject), or doing too much work to render
lighting. This reduces the number of the draw calls the CPU sends, and the
number of vertices and **pixels** The smallest unit in a computer image. Pixel
size depends on your screen resolution. Pixel lighting is calculated at every
screen pixel. [More info](ShadowPerformance.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#pixel) the GPU processes.

Do the following:

  * Use [lightmapping](Lightmapping-landing.html) to light static objects, instead of **realtime lights** Light components whose Mode property is set to Realtime. Unity calculates and updates the lighting of Realtime Lights every frame at runtime. No Realtime Lights are precomputed. [More info](LightModes-introduction.html#realtime)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#RealtimeLights).

  * Avoid combining meshes if they’re lit by different realtime per-pixel lights, because Unity calculates every light for every combined **mesh** The main graphics primitive of Unity. Meshes make up a large part of your 3D worlds. Unity supports triangulated or Quadrangulated polygon meshes. Nurbs, Nurms, Subdiv surfaces must be converted to polygons. [More info](mesh.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Mesh).

  * Avoid lighting GameObjects with multiple per-pixel lights.

## Prioritize lights

To avoid lighting GameObjects with multiple per-pixel lights, prioritize which
lights provide per-pixel lighting based on which GameObjects they light.

For example, in a driving game, prioritize the car headlights as a per-pixel
light, but deprioritize the rear lights and distant lampposts.

To decrease the number of per-pixel lights, do any of the following:

  * In the [Light component Inspector window](class-Light.html), set **Render Mode** to **Not important**. This sets the light as a per-vertex light or spherical harmonics (SH) light.
  * In the [Quality settings window](class-QualitySettings.html), decrease **Pixel Light Count**. This excludes lights from the per-pixel light group.

To increase the number of per-pixel lights, do any of the following:

  * In the [Light component Inspector window](class-Light.html), increase the **Intensity**. The brightest light is always a per-pixel light.
  * In the [Light component Inspector window](class-Light.html), set **Render Mode** to **Important**. This sets the light as a per-pixel light.
  * In the [Quality settings window](class-QualitySettings.html), increase **Pixel Light Count**. This includes more lights in the per-pixel light group.

## Disable per-vertex and spherical harmonics (SH) lights

To disable per-vertex and SH lights in a custom **shader** A program that runs
on the GPU. [More info](Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Shader), add the `OnlyDirectional` tag to the
Pass in your **ShaderLab** Unity’s language for defining the structure of
Shader objects. [More info](SL-Shader.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#ShaderLab) code. For more information, refer
to [Pass tags in ShaderLab reference](SL-PassTags.html).
