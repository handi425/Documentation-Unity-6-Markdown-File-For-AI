Introduction to cameras

# Cameras

Resources and approaches for using **cameras** A component which creates an
image of a particular viewpoint in your scene. The output is either drawn to
the screen or captured as a texture. [More info](CamerasOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Camera) to view and render a **scene** A Scene
contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene
file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles,
and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More
info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene) in Unity.
