**[Core packages](pack-core.html)** | View the list of packages that are bound to this version of the Unity Editor.  
**[Built-in packages](pack-build.html) _Built-in_ packages allow users to
toggle Unity features on or off through the Package Manager. Enabling or
disabling a package reduces the run-time build size. For example, most
projects don’t use the legacy Particle System. By removing the abstracted
package of this feature, the related code and resources are not part of the
final built product. Typically, these packages contain only the package
manifest and are bundled with Unity (rather than available on the package
registry).  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Built-inpackage)** | View the list of built-in packages, which you can enable or disable to adjust the runtime build size.
