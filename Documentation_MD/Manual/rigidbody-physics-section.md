Introduction to rigid body physics

# Rigidbody physics

In physics simulation, [rigid
bodies](https://docs.nvidia.com/gameworks/content/gameworkslibrary/physx/guide/Manual/RigidBodyOverview.html)
enable physics-based behaviour such as movement, gravity, and **collision** A
collision occurs when the physics engine detects that the colliders of two
GameObjects make contact or overlap, when at least one has a Rigidbody
component and is in motion. [More info](CollidersOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Collision).

In Unity, you can configure rigid bodies with the
[`Rigidbody`](../ScriptReference/Rigidbody.html) class, or the corresponding
[Rigidbody](class-Rigidbody.html)A component that allows a GameObject to be
affected by simulated gravity and other forces. [More info](class-
Rigidbody.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Rigidbody) component.

**Topic** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Introduction to Rigidbody physics](RigidbodiesOverview.html) | Overview of the concepts and fundamental behaviours of the Rigidbody class and component.  
[Configure Rigidbody colliders](rigidbody-configure-colliders.html) | How to configure **Colliders** An invisible shape that is used to handle physical collisions for an object. A collider doesn’t need to be exactly the same shape as the object’s mesh - a rough approximation is often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay. [More info](CollidersOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Collider) on a Rigidbody so that the physics
system can accurately detect collisions.  
[Apply constant force to a Rigidbody](rigidbody-constant-force.html) | How and when to apply a constant linear or rotational force to a Rigidbody **GameObject** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject).  
[Apply interpolation to a Rigidbody](rigidbody-interpolation.html) | How to use interpolation to smoothen the movement of a Rigidbody if it appears jittery at runtime.  
[Rigidbody component reference](class-Rigidbody.html) | Reference page for the Rigidbody component.  
[Constant Force component reference](class-ConstantForce.html) | Reference page for the **Constant Force** A simple component for adding a constant force or torque to game objects with a Rigidbody. [More info](class-ConstantForce.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#ConstantForce) component.
