Writing Surface Shaders

# Writing custom shaders in the Built-In Render Pipeline

Resources for writing HLSL code and Surface **Shaders** A program that runs on
the GPU. [More info](Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Shader) in the Built-In **Render Pipeline** A
series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a
screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your
own. [More info](render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Renderpipeline).

[Writing Surface Shaders](writing-surface-shaders.html) | Resources and techniques for writing **Surface Shaders** A streamlined way of writing shaders for the Built-in Render Pipeline. [More info](SL-SurfaceShaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#SurfaceShader) in the Built-In Render
Pipeline, which are streamlined shaders that interact with lighting.

[Get the current framebuffer with the GrabPass command](writing-shader-grabpass.html) | Create a special type of Pass that grabs the contents of the frame buffer into a texture, so you can use it in subsequent passes to do advanced image based effects.
