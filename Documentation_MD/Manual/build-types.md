Introduction to build profiles

# Understanding build types

Unity produces two build types:

  * A **release** build, which includes only what’s necessary to run the application. This is the default build type.
  * A **development** build, which includes scripting debug symbols and the **profiler** A window that helps you to optimize your game. It shows how much time is spent in the various areas of your game. For example, it can report the percentage of time spent rendering, animating, or in your game logic. [More info](Profiler.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Profiler). Select the **development build** A
development build includes debug symbols and enables the Profiler. [More
info](https://docs.unity.com/devops/en/manual/build-target-
configurations#Build_target_advanced_settings_overview)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#DevelopmentBuild) option to enable an
additional set of options, such as deep profiling support and script
debugging.

For faster iteration during development, Unity uses an incremental build
pipeline that rebuilds artifacts only if they have changed since the previous
build. For more information, refer to [Incremental build
pipeline](incremental-build-pipeline.html).
