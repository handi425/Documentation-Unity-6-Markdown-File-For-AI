Retarget Humanoid animations

# Humanoid Avatar

Unity’s Animation System has special features for working with humanoid
characters. Because humanoid characters are so common in games, Unity provides
a specialized workflow, and an extended tool set for **humanoid animations**
An animation using humanoid skeletons. Humanoid models generally have the same
basic structure, representing the major articulate parts of the body, head and
limbs. This makes it easy to map animations from one humanoid skeleton to
another, allowing retargeting and inverse kinematics. [More
info](ConfiguringtheAvatar.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Humanoidanimation).

[The Avatar system](ConfiguringtheAvatar.html) is how Unity identifies that a
particular animated model is a humanoid, and which parts of the model
correspond to the legs, arms, head, and body.

Because of the similarity in bone structure between different humanoid
characters, it is possible to map animations from one humanoid character to
another.

The following topics provide more details on humanoid animation and **root
motion** Motion of character’s root node, whether it’s controlled by the
animation itself or externally. [More info](RootMotion.html)
