Unity's Package Manager

# Packages and feature sets

A _package_ contains features to fit the various needs of your project. This
can include any core Unity features included during the Editor installation,
or other packages that you can install as needed.

**[Unity’s Package Manager](Packages.html)** | Learn about the different ways you can interact with Unity’s Package Manager, to do things like finding and adding or removing packages, resolving package conflicts, and much more.  
**[Packages](Packages-all.html) Packages are collections of assets to be
shared and re-used in Unity. The [Unity Package Manager](upm-ui.html) (UPM)
can display, add, and remove packages from your project. These packages are
native to the Unity Package Manager and provide a fundamental method of
delivering Unity functionality. However, the Unity Package Manager can also
display [Asset Store packages](AssetStorePackages.html) that you downloaded
from the Asset Store. [More info](Packages.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Packages)** | View the lists of packages you can install.  
**[Creating custom packages](CustomPackages.html)** | Build and share your own packages, by learning about custom package requirements, working with manifest files, and more.  
**[Feature sets](FeatureSets.html) A feature set is a collection of related
packages that you can use to achieve specific results in the Unity Editor. You
can manage feature sets directly in Unity’s Package Manager. [More
info](FeatureSets.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Featureset)** | Learn about bundles of related packages that you can use for a specific task, such as building environments or optimizing specific platforms, or to find all the development tools you need in one place. Also view a list of feature sets that are available in this version of the Editor.
