# Requirements and compatibility for URP

This page contains information on system requirements and compatibility of
this package.

## Unity Editor compatibility

The following table shows the compatibility of URP package versions with
different Unity Editor versions.

Package version | Minimum Unity version | Maximum Unity version  
---|---|---  
16.0.x | 2023.2 | 2023.x  
15.0.x | 2023.1 | 2023.1  
14.0.x | 2022.2 | 2022.x  
13.x.x | 2022.1 | 2022.1  
12.0.x | 2021.2 | 2021.3  
11.0.0 | 2021.1 | 2021.1  
10.x | 2020.2 | 2020.3  
9.x-preview | 2020.1 | 2020.2  
8.x | 2020.1 | 2020.1  
7.x | 2019.3 | 2019.4  
  
Since the release of Unity 2021.1, graphics packages are [core Unity
packages](https://docs.unity3d.com/2021.2/Documentation/Manual/pack-
core.html).

For each release of Unity (alpha, beta, patch release), the main Unity
installer contains the up-to-date versions of the following graphics packages:
SRP Core, URP, HDRP, **Shader** A program that runs on the GPU. [More
info](../Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Shader) Graph, VFX Graph. Since the release
of Unity 2021.1, the Package Manager shows only the major revisions of the
graphics packages (version 11.0.0 for all Unity 2021.1.x releases, version
12.0.0 for all Unity 2021.2.x releases).

You can install a different version of a graphics package from disk using the
Package Manager, or by modifying the `manifest.json` file.

## Render pipeline compatibility

Projects made using URP are not compatible with the High Definition Render
Pipeline (HDRP) or the Built-in Render Pipeline. Before you start development,
you must decide which render pipeline to use in your Project. For information
on choosing a render pipeline, check the [Render
Pipelines](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.3/Documentation/Manual/render-
pipelines.html)A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and
displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render
pipelines, or write your own. [More info](../render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) section of the Unity
Manual.

## Unity Player system requirements

This package does not add any extra platform-specific requirements. General
system requirements for the Unity Player apply. For more information on Unity
system requirements, check the [System requirements for
Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/system-requirements.html).
