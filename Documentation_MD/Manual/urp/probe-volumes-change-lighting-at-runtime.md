# Changing lighting at runtime

You can change how objects use the baked data in Adaptive Probe Volumes, to
create lighting that changes at runtime. For example, you can turn the lights
on and off in a **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your
game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you
place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and
building your game in pieces. [More info](../CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Scene), or change the time of day.
