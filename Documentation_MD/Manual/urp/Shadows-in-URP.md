Configure shadow resolution in the Universal Render Pipeline

# Shadows in URP

Resources for configuring and troubleshooting shadows in the Universal
**Render Pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene,
and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render
pipelines, or write your own. [More info](../render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) (URP).

**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Optimize shadow rendering](../shadows-optimization.html) | Optimization techniques that help you make shadow rendering faster in your project.  
[Configure shadow resolution](shadow-resolution-urp.html) | Configure the shadow resolution of the directional light and the additional lights.  
[Add screen space shadows](renderer-feature-screen-space-shadows.html) | Add a Screen Space Shadows Renderer Feature to calculate shadows from a **render texture** A special type of Texture that is created and updated at runtime. To use them, first create a new Render Texture and designate one of your Cameras to render into it. Then you can use the Render Texture in a Material just like a regular Texture. [More info](../class-RenderTexture.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#RenderTexture) instead of shadow cascades.  
[Screen space ambient occlusion](post-processing-ssao-landing.html) | Resources for adding a Renderer Feature to darkens creases, holes, intersections and surfaces that are close to each other in real-time.  
[Visualize shadow cascades](shadow-cascades-visualize.html) | Visualize shadow cascades to make configuration easier.  
[Troubleshooting shadows in URP](shadows-troubleshooting-urp.html) | Techniques for troubleshooting shadow rendering.  
  
## Additional resources

  * [Shadows](../Shadows.html)A UI component that adds a simple outline effect to graphic components such as Text or Image. It must be on the same GameObject as the graphic component.
