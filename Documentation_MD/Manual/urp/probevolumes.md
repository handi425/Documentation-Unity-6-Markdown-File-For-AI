Introduction to Adaptive Probe Volumes

# Adaptive Probe Volumes (APV) in URP

Adaptive Probe Volumes make [Light
Probes](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LightProbes.html)Light probes store
information about how light passes through space in your scene. A collection
of light probes arranged within a given space can improve lighting on moving
objects and static LOD scenery within that space. [More
info](../LightProbes.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#LightProbe) easier to use by automating
placement. They also provide higher quality, more accurate lighting, because
they light per-pixel not per-object.

Topic | Description  
---|---  
[Introduction to Adaptive Probe Volumes](probevolumes-concept.html) | The purpose of Adaptive Probe Volumes and what you can do with them.  
[Use Adaptive Probe Volumes](probevolumes-use.html) | Add Adaptive Probe Volumes to your project and configure them.  
[Display Adaptive Probe Volumes](probevolumes-showandadjust.html) | Visualize the structure of Adaptive Probe Volumes.  
[Configure the size and density of Adaptive Probe Volumes](probevolumes-changedensity.html) | Change the size of an Adaptive Probe Volume, or increase the density of Light Probes.  
[Bake multiple scenes together with Baking Sets](probevolumes-usebakingsets.html) | Add **scenes** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](../CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Scene) to a Baking Set so you can bake the
lighting for all the scenes together.  
[Optimize loading Adaptive Probe Volume data](probevolumes-streaming.html) | Stream lighting data to provide lighting for large open worlds, or load data from AssetBundles or Addressables.  
[Changing lighting at runtime](probe-volumes-change-lighting-at-runtime.html) | Use Lighting Scenarios or sky occlusion to change how objects use the data in Adaptive Probe Volumes at runtime.  
[Troubleshooting Adaptive Probe Volumes](probevolumes-fixissues.html) | Solve common issues with Adaptive Probe Volumes, such as light leaks and seams.  
[Adaptive Probe Volume Inspector window reference](probevolumes-inspector-reference.html) | Reference for the Adaptive Probe Volume **Inspector** A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. [More info](../UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Inspector) window.  
[Adaptive Probe Volumes panel reference](probevolumes-lighting-panel-reference.html) | Reference for the Adaptive Probe Volumes panel in the Lighting settings.  
[Probe Volumes Options Override reference](probevolumes-options-override-reference.html) | Reference for the Probe Volumes Options Override.
