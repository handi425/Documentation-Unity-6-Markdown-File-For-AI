# Split Toning Volume Override reference for URP

This effect tints different areas of the image based on luminance values, to
help you achieve a more distinctive look. You can use this to add different
color tones to the shadows and highlights in your **scene** A Scene contains
the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a
unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and
decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More
info](../CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Scene).

## Properties

When you adjust the color in the color picker for each property, you should
only adjust the **Hue** and **Saturation**. **Value** also changes the overall
image brightness.

**Property** | **Description**  
---|---  
**Shadows** | Use the color picker to select the color that URP uses for tinting shadows.  
**Highlights** | Use the color picker to select the color that URP uses for tinting highlights.  
**Balance** | Use the slider to set the balance between **Shadows** and **Highlights**. Lower values result in more pronounced shadow toning is compared to highlight toning. Higher values result in the opposite effect, with more pronounced highlight toning compared to shadow toning.
