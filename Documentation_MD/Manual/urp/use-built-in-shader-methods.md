# Shader methods in URP

Resources for the library of High-Level **Shader** A program that runs on the
GPU. [More info](../Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Shader) Language (HLSL) shader files that
contain helper methods.

**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Import a file from the URP shader library](use-built-in-shader-methods-import.html) | Use the `#include` directive in HLSL to import a URP shader file.  
[Transform positions in a custom URP shader](use-built-in-shader-methods-transformations.html) | Transform vertex, fragment, normal and tangent positions between coordinate spaces.  
[Use the camera in a custom URP shader](use-built-in-shader-methods-camera.html) | Get the position and direction of the **camera** A component which creates an image of a particular viewpoint in your scene. The output is either drawn to the screen or captured as a texture. [More info](../CamerasOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Camera).  
[Use lighting in a custom URP shader](use-built-in-shader-methods-lighting.html) | Get the lights in a **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](../CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Scene), and calculate lighting.  
[Use indirect lighting in a custom URP shader](use-built-in-shader-methods-indirect-lighting.html) | Use **reflection probes** A rendering component that captures a spherical view of its surroundings in all directions, rather like a camera. The captured image is then stored as a Cubemap that can be used by objects with reflective materials. [More info](../class-ReflectionProbe.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#ReflectionProbe) or Adaptive Probe Volumes
in a URP shader.  
[Use shadows in a custom URP shader](use-built-in-shader-methods-shadows.html) | Get shadow data from lights in the scene, and calculate shadows.  
[ShaderLab Pass tags in URP reference](urp-shaders/urp-shaderlab-pass-tags.html) | Find the Pass tags URP uses to determine which shader passes to run in different parts of the **render pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](../render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Renderpipeline).
