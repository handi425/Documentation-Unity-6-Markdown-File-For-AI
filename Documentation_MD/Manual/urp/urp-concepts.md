Rendering in the Universal Render Pipeline

# Universal Render Pipeline fundamentals

Resources for understanding the rendering loop and the different **rendering
paths** The technique that a render pipeline uses to render graphics. Choosing
a different rendering path affects how lighting and shading are calculated.
Some rendering paths are more suited to different platforms and hardware than
others. [More info](../RenderingPaths.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#RenderingPath) in the Universal **Render
Pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and
displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render
pipelines, or write your own. [More info](../render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) (URP).

**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Rendering in URP](rendering-in-universalrp.html) | Understand the frame rendering loop and the **camera** A component which creates an image of a particular viewpoint in your scene. The output is either drawn to the screen or captured as a texture. [More info](../CamerasOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Camera) loop in URP.  
[Rendering paths in URP](rendering-paths-landing.html) | Resources for choosing between the Forward, Forward+, and Deferred rendering paths in URP.
