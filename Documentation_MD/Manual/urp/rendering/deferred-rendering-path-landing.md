Resources for using the Deferred **rendering path** The technique that a
render pipeline uses to render graphics. Choosing a different rendering path
affects how lighting and shading are calculated. Some rendering paths are more
suited to different platforms and hardware than others. [More
info](../../RenderingPaths.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#RenderingPath), which has no limit on
the number of lights that can affect an opaque **GameObject** The fundamental
object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery,
cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the
Components attached to it. [More info](../../class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#GameObject).

**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Introduction to the Deferred rendering path](../rendering/deferred-rendering-path-introduction.html) | Learn about how the Deferred rendering path works, and its limitations.  
[Render passes in the Deferred rendering path](../rendering/render-passes-deferred.html) | Learn about the sequence of render pass events in the Deferred rendering path.  
[G-buffer layout in the Deferred rendering path](../rendering/g-buffer-layout.html) | Understand how Unity stores material attributes in the geometry buffer (G-buffer) in the Deferred rendering path.  
[Enable accurate G-buffer normals](../rendering/accurate-g-buffer-normals.html) | Configure how Unity encodes normals when it stores them in the G-buffer.  
[Make a shader compatible with the Deferred rendering path](../rendering/make-shader-compatible-with-deferred.html) | Use the `LightMode` tag in a **shader** A program that runs on the GPU. [More info](../../Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#Shader) to make the shader compatible
with the Deferred rendering path.
