# Blend Modes

This property determines how Unity blends the lighting with the colors of the
**sprite** A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are
essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for
combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during
development. [More info](../sprite/sprite-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Sprite) and other **GameObjects** The
fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props,
scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined
by the Components attached to it. [More info](../class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#GameObject) that the light affects. The
following are some examples of how different **Blend Modes** affect how a
sprite is lit.
