Write an unlit basic shader in URP

# Create a sample scene in URP

To follow the examples in this section:

  1. Install URP into an existing Unity project, or create a new project using the [**Universal Project Template**](creating-a-new-project-with-urp.html).

  2. In the sample **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](../CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Scene), create a **GameObject** The
fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props,
scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined
by the Components attached to it. [More info](../class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#GameObject) to test the **shaders** A
program that runs on the GPU. [More info](../Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Shader) on; for example, a capsule.

![Sample GameObject](../../uploads/urp/shader-examples/urp-template-sample-
object.png) Sample GameObject

  3. Create a new Material and assign it to the capsule.

  4. Create a new Shader asset and assign it to the Material of the capsule. When following an example, open the shader asset to edit the Unity shader source file. Replace the code in the source file with the code in the example.

To start writing URP shaders, continue to section [URP unlit basic
shader](writing-shaders-urp-basic-unlit-structure.html).
