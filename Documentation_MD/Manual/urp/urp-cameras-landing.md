Introduction to cameras in URP

# Cameras in URP

Resources for using cameras in the Universal **Render Pipeline** A series of
operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen.
Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own.
[More info](../render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) (URP).

[Introduction to cameras in URP](cameras/camera-differences-in-urp.html) | Understand how to use and configure cameras in URP.  
[Camera render types](camera-types-and-render-type.html) | Resources and techniques for the Base and Overlay camera types in URP.  
[Multiple cameras](cameras-multiple.html) | Set up and use more than one camera in a **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](../CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Scene) to use in a camera stack, a split
screen effect, or **post-processing** A process that improves product visuals
by applying filters and effects before the image appears on screen. You can
use post-processing effects to simulate physical camera and film properties,
for example Bloom and Depth of Field. [More

## Additional properties

  * [Cameras](../Cameras.html)A component which creates an image of a particular viewpoint in your scene. The output is either drawn to the screen or captured as a texture. [More info](../CamerasOverview.html)
