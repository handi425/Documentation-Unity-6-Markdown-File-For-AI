Introduction to post-processing in URP

# Post-processing in URP

Approaches and resources for applying **post-processing** A process that
improves product visuals by applying filters and effects before the image
appears on screen. You can use post-processing effects to simulate physical
camera and film properties, for example Bloom and Depth of Field. [More
info](../PostProcessingOverview.html) post processing, postprocessing,
postprocess  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#post-processing) effects to create stylised
visuals, or simulate physical **camera** A component which creates an image of
a particular viewpoint in your scene. The output is either drawn to the screen
or captured as a texture. [More info](../CamerasOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Camera) and film properties in the
Universal **Render Pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of
a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built
render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](../render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) (URP).

[Add post-processing](add-post-processing.html) | Add post-processing to a **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](../CreatingScenes.html)
