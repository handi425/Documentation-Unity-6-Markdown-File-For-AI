# Blend Modes in 2D lighting

Techniques and resources demonstrating how **Blend Styles** and masks affect
how **sprites** A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D,
Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special
techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and
convenience during development. [More info](../sprite/sprite-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Sprite) are lit.

Topic | Description  
---|---  
[Blend modes](2d-light-blend-modes.html) | Understand how different **Blend Modes** visually affect the way a sprite is lit.  
[Masking](2d-light-masking.html) | Understand how masks interact with different **Blend Modes**.  
[Add normal map and mask textures to a sprite in URP](SecondaryTextures.html) | Assign **normal map** A type of Bump Map texture that allows you to add surface detail such as bumps, grooves, and scratches to a model which catch the light as if they are represented by real geometry.  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Normalmap) and mask textures to sprites to
create advanced lighting effects with 2D lights.
