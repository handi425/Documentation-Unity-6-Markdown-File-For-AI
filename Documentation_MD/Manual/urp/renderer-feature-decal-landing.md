Introduction to decals in URP

# Decals in URP

Techniques for using a Decal Renderer Feature or a Decal Projector in the
Universal **Render Pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of
a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built
render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](../render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) (URP).

**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Introduction to decals](renderer-feature-decal.html) | Learn about Decal Renderer Features and their limitations.  
[Create a decal via a Decal Renderer Feature](renderer-feature-decal-create.html) | Create a decal in your **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](../CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Scene) using a Decal Renderer Feature.  
[Create a decal via a Decal Projector](decal-shader.html) | Create a decal in your scene using a Decal Projector and a Decal Material.  
[Decal Rendererer Feature reference](renderer-feature-decal-reference.html) | Explore the properties and settings in the Decal Renderer Feature window to configure how decals look.  
[Decal Projector component reference](renderer-feature-decal-projector-reference.html) | Explore the properties and settings in the Decal Projector component window to assign a Decal Material as a decal.  
[Decal Shader Graph reference](decal-shader-graph-reference.html) | Explore the properties and settings in a Decal **Shader** A program that runs on the GPU. [More info](../Shaders.html)
