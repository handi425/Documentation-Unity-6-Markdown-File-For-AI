Introduction to rendering paths in URP

# Rendering paths in URP

Resources for choosing between the Forward, Forward+, and Deferred **rendering
paths** The technique that a render pipeline uses to render graphics. Choosing
a different rendering path affects how lighting and shading are calculated.
Some rendering paths are more suited to different platforms and hardware than
others. [More info](../RenderingPaths.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#RenderingPath) in the Universal **Render
Pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and
displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render
pipelines, or write your own. [More info](../render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) (URP).

**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Introduction to rendering paths](rendering-paths-introduction-urp.html) | Understand the differences between the Forward, Forward+ and Deferred rendering paths in URP.  
[Choose a rendering path](rendering-paths-comparison.html) | Decide which rendering path to use for your Universal Render Pipeline (URP) project, depending on the type of project and the target hardware.  
[Set the rendering path](rendering-paths-set.html) | Use the **Rendering Path** setting in the Universal Renderer asset to set the rendering path.  
[Forward and Forward+ rendering paths](rendering/forward-rendering-paths.html) | Learn more about the Forward and Forward+ rendering paths in URP.  
[Deferred rendering path](rendering/deferred-rendering-path-landing.html) | Resources for using the Deferred rendering path, which has no limit on the number of lights that can affect an opaque **GameObject** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](../class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#GameObject).  
[Troubleshooting the Forward+ rendering path](rendering/forward-plus-rendering-path-limitations.html) | Solve common issues with the Forward+ rendering path, for example reduce the maximum number of visible lights to reduce build times.
