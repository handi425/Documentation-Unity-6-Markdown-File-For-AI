# Set the rendering path in URP

To select a **rendering path** The technique that a render pipeline uses to
render graphics. Choosing a different rendering path affects how lighting and
shading are calculated. Some rendering paths are more suited to different
platforms and hardware than others. [More info](../RenderingPaths.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#RenderingPath) in the Universal Pipeline,
first do one of the following:

  * To set the rendering path for the entire project, go to **Edit** > **Project Settings** > **Graphics**.
  * To set the rendering path for a quality level, go to **Edit** > **Project Settings** > **Quality** and select a quality level.

Then follow these steps:

  1. Double-click the ****Render Pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](../render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) Asset**.

  2. In the **Rendering** section of the **Inspector** A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. [More info](../UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Inspector) window, double-click the
renderer in the **Renderer List**.

  3. Set **Rendering Path**.
