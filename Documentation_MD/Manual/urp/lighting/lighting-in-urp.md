# Introduction to lighting in the Universal Render Pipeline

All of Unity’s render pipelines share common lighting functionality, but each
**render pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene,
and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render
pipelines, or write your own. [More info](../../render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) has some important
differences.

In URP, the following applies:

  * The [Light component inspector](../light-component.html) displays some URP-specific controls.
  * The [Universal Additional Light Data](../universal-additional-light-data.html) component allows Unity to store Light-related data that is specific to URP.
