Introduction to lighting in the Universal Render Pipeline

# Lighting in URP

Using the Universal **Render Pipeline** A series of operations that take the
contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from
pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](../render-
pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) (URP), you can achieve
realistic lighting that is suitable for a range of art styles.

Page | Description  
---|---  
[Lighting in URP](lighting/lighting-in-urp.html) | Understand the lighting settings and properties that are specific to URP.  
[Light limits in URP](lighting/light-limits-in-urp.html) | Understand the number of lights URP can render per-object and per-camera, and how to render more lights.  
[View and control a light from its perspective](lights-placement-tool.html) | Use the Light Placement Tool to view a **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](../CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Scene) from a light source’s perspective.  
[Shadows](Shadows-in-URP.html)A UI component that adds a simple outline effect
to graphic components such as Text or Image. It must be on the same GameObject
as the graphic component. [More
info](../https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ugui@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/script-
Shadow.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Shadow) | Resources for configuring and troubleshooting shadows in URP.  
[Reflections](lighting/reflection-probes.html) | Configure the URP-specific behavior of **Reflection Probes** A rendering component that captures a spherical view of its surroundings in all directions, rather like a camera. The captured image is then stored as a Cubemap that can be used by objects with reflective materials. [More info](../class-ReflectionProbe.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#ReflectionProbe).  
[Adaptive Probe Volumes (APV)](probevolumes.html) | Approaches and resources for using Adaptive Probe Volumes to provide higher quality, more accurate lighting.  
[Rendering Layers](features/rendering-layers.html) | Resources for configuring certain Lights or Decals to affect only specific **GameObjects** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](../class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#GameObject).  
[Universal Additional Light Data component in URP](universal-additional-light-data.html) | Understand how the Universal Additional Light Data component allows URP to extend and override the functionality of Light components.  
[Light component Inspector window reference](light-component.html) | Explore the properties and settings in the Light component **Inspector** A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. [More info](../UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Inspector) window to customize settings
specific to URP.  
[Custom lighting in URP](lighting/custom-lighting-landing.html) | Implement custom lighting models to have more control over the visual style and achieve better performance.
