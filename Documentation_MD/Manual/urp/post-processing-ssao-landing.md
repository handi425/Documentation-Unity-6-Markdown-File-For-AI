Introduction to screen space ambient occlusion in URP

# Screen space ambient occlusion (SSAO) in URP

Resources for adding a Renderer Feature to darken creases, holes,
intersections and surfaces that are close to each other in real-time in the
Univeral **Render Pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of
a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built
render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](../render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) (URP).

**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Introduction to screen space ambient occlusion](post-processing-ssao.html) | Learn how screen space **ambient occlusion** A method to approximate how much ambient light (light not coming from a specific direction) can hit a point on a surface.  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Ambientocclusion) works in URP, and check
examples.  
[Add an SSAO Renderer Feature to a URP Renderer](add-ssao-renderer-feature-to-renderer.html) | Add a screen space ambient occlusion Renderer Feature to a URP Renderer.  
[Configure SSAO](ssao-renderer-feature-reference.html) | Find and configure the settings you need to adjust ambient occlusion to your **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](../CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Scene).  
  
## Additional resources

  * [Shadows](../Shadows.html)A UI component that adds a simple outline effect to graphic components such as Text or Image. It must be on the same GameObject as the graphic component.
