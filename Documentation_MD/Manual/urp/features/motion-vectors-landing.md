Introduction to motion vectors in URP

# Motion vectors in URP

Resources for outputting and reading a texture with data about object motion
in the **camera** A component which creates an image of a particular viewpoint
in your scene. The output is either drawn to the screen or captured as a
texture. [More info](../../CamerasOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#Camera) view.

**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Introduction to motion vectors](../features/motion-vectors.html) | Learn about how URP calculates the frame-to-frame screen-space movement of surface fragments.  
[Built-in shader support for motion vectors](../features/motion-vectors-shader-support.html) | Learn about which types of motion different **shader** A program that runs on the GPU. [More info](../../Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#Shader) types support for calculating
motion vectors.  
[Motion vectors render pass](../features/motion-vectors-render-pass.html) | Understand how the `MotionVectors` render pass renders the motion vector texture.  
[Output a motion vector texture in a custom shader](../features/motion-vectors-custom-shader.html) | Render a motion vector texture in a custom shader.  
[Sample motion vectors in a shader](../features/motion-vectors-sample.html) | Request the motion vector texture as an input in a custom shader.  
[Troubleshooting motion vectors](../features/motion-vectors-troubleshooting.html) | Solve common issues with motion vectors, for example visual artefacts.  
[Motion Vectors settings in the MeshRenderer component window reference](../features/motion-vectors-reference.html) | Explore the properties in the Motion Vectors settings to specify how a **GameObject** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](../../class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#GameObject) contributes to a motion
vector texture.
