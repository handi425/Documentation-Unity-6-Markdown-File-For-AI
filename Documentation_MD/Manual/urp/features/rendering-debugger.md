# Rendering Debugger in URP

The Rendering Debugger lets you visualize various lighting, rendering, and
Material properties. The visualizations help you identify rendering issues and
optimize **scenes** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game.
Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place
your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and
building your game in pieces. [More info](../../CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#Scene) and rendering configurations.

Page | Description  
---|---  
[Enable the Rendering Debugger](rendering-debugger-use.html) | Open the Rendering Debugger as a window in the Editor, or as an overlay in Game view, Play Mode, or your built application.  
[Add controls to the Rendering Debugger](rendering-debugger-add-controls.html) | Customise the Rendering Debugger window with your own controls and **scripts** A piece of code that allows you to create your own Components, trigger game events, modify Component properties over time and respond to user input in any way you like. [More info](../../creating-scripts.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#Scripts), to visualize your project’s
lighting, rendering or material properties.
