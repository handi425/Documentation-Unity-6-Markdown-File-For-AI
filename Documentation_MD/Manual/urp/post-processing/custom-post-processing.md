# Custom post-processing in URP

The Universal **Render Pipeline** A series of operations that take the
contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from
pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](../../render-
pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) (URP) provides a variety
of pre-built [post-processing effects](../integration-with-post-
processing.html) that you can adjust to create a particular visual effect or
style. URP also lets you create custom **post-processing** A process that
improves product visuals by applying filters and effects before the image
appears on screen. You can use post-processing effects to simulate physical
camera and film properties, for example Bloom and Depth of Field. [More
info](../../PostProcessingOverview.html) post processing, postprocessing,
postprocess  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#post-processing) effects.

The following page describe different approaches to creating custom post-
processing effects.
