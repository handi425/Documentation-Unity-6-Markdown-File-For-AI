Universal Render Pipeline fundamentals

# Get started with URP

Resources for understanding fundamental concepts and assets in the Universal
Render Pipeline (URP), and installing and upgrading.

**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[URP fundamentals](urp-concepts.html) | Resources for understanding the rendering loop and the different **rendering paths** The technique that a render pipeline uses to render graphics. Choosing a different rendering path affects how lighting and shading are calculated. Some rendering paths are more suited to different platforms and hardware than others. [More info](../RenderingPaths.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#RenderingPath) in URP.  
[Installing and upgrading URP](InstallingAndConfiguringURP.html) | Create a project that uses URP, or upgrade to URP from the Built-In Render Pipeline.  
[Configure for better performance](configure-for-better-performance.html) | Disable or change URP settings and features that have a large performance impact.
