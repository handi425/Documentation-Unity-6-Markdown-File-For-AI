Creating a URP project

# Installing and upgrading URP

Create a project that uses the Universal **Render Pipeline** A series of
operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen.
Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own.
[More info](../render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) (URP), or upgrade to URP
from the Built-In Render Pipeline.

**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Creating a URP project](creating-a-urp-project.html) | Resources for creating a new project that uses URP, or installing URP into an existing project that uses the Built-In Render Pipeline.  
[Upgrading from the Built-In Render Pipeline to URP](upgrading-from-birp.html) | Resources for using the Render Pipeline Converter to upgrade a project to URP, and match quality settings from the Built-In Render Pipeline.  
[Upgrade URP](upgrade-guides.html) | Upgrade from an older version of URP to a more recent version, or upgrade from the Lightweight Render Pipeline (LWRP).  
[Known issues](known-issues.html) | Solve common issues with URP, such as long build times in the Forward+ **rendering path** The technique that a render pipeline uses to render graphics. Choosing a different rendering path affects how lighting and shading are calculated. Some rendering paths are more suited to different platforms and hardware than others. [More info](../RenderingPaths.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#RenderingPath), or incorrect rendering in
the URP package samples.
