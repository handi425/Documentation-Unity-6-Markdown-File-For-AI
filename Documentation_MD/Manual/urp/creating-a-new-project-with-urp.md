Scene templates in URP

# Create a new project that uses URP

If you are starting a new Project from scratch, this is the best choice. When
you do this, Unity automatically installs and configures URP for you.

The Unity Hub contains the following templates that let you create a pre-
configured Universal **Render Pipeline** A series of operations that take the
contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from
pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](../render-
pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) (URP) project.

**Template** | **Description**  
---|---  
Universal 2D | This is an empty project for 2D applications. URP is pre-configured with 2D renderer.  
Universal 3D | This is an empty project for 3D applications. URP is pre-configured with 3D renderer.  
Universal 3D sample | This sample contains four environments that showcase the versatility, scalability, and customizability of URP. The project demonstrates different art styles, **rendering paths** The technique that a render pipeline uses to render graphics. Choosing a different rendering path affects how lighting and shading are calculated. Some rendering paths are more suited to different platforms and hardware than others. [More info](../RenderingPaths.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#RenderingPath), and **scene** A Scene
contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene
file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles,
and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More
info](../CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Scene) complexities. Each scene shows you
how to tailor a project to different platforms, from mobile and untethered
devices to high-end PCs and consoles.  
  
To create a new project using a URP template:

  1. Open the Unity Hub.

  2. Select the **Projects** tab, then select **New project**.

  3. Select one of the URP templates.

  4. Fill in the ****Project settings** A broad collection of settings which allow you to configure how Physics, Audio, Networking, Graphics, Input and many other areas of your project behave. [More info](../comp-ManagerGroup.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#ProjectSettings)** fields and select
**Create project**. Unity creates a new pre-configured URP project.

Projects made using URP are not compatible with the High Definition Render
Pipeline (HDRP) or the Built-in Render Pipeline. Before you start development,
you must decide which render pipeline to use in your Project. For information
on choosing a render pipeline, refer to [the Render Pipelines section of the
Unity Manual](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.3/Documentation/Manual/render-
pipelines.html).
