# Volumes in URP

Use volumes to apply **post-processing** A process that improves product
visuals by applying filters and effects before the image appears on screen.
You can use post-processing effects to simulate physical camera and film
properties, for example Bloom and Depth of Field. [More
info](../PostProcessingOverview.html) post processing, postprocessing,
postprocess  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#post-processing) effects to part or all of
a **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of
each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your
environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building
your game in pieces. [More info](../CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Scene).
