# Upgrading shaders to URP from the Built-In Render Pipeline

Approaches for convering **shaders** A program that runs on the GPU. [More
info](../Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Shader) from a Built-In **Render Pipeline**
A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on
a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your
own. [More info](../render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) project so that they work
in a URP project.
