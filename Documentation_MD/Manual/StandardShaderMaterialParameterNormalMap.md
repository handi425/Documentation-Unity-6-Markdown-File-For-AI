Introduction to surface normals

# Introduction to normal maps (bump mapping)

Normal maps are a type of ****Bump Map****. They are a special kind of texture
that allow you to add surface detail such as bumps, grooves, and scratches to
a model which catch the light as if they are represented by real geometry.

Unity uses Y+ **normal maps** A type of Bump Map texture that allows you to
add surface detail such as bumps, grooves, and scratches to a model which
catch the light as if they are represented by real geometry.  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Normalmap), sometimes known as OpenGL format.

For example, you might want to show a surface which has grooves and screws or
rivets across the surface, like an aircraft hull. One way to do this would be
to model these details as geometry, as shown below.

![A sheet of aircraft metal with details modeled as real
geometry.](../uploads/Main/StandardShaderNormalMapBadGeometry.jpg) A sheet of
aircraft metal with details modeled as real geometry.

Depending on the situation it is not normally a good idea to have such tiny
details modelled as “real” geometry. On the right you can see the polygons
required to make up the detail of a single screwhead. Over a large model with
lots of fine surface detail this would require a very high number of polygons
to be drawn. To avoid this, we should use a normal map to represent the fine
surface detail, and a lower resolution polygonal surface for the larger shape
of the model.

If we instead represent this detail with a bump map, the surface geometry can
become much simpler, and the detail is represented as a texture which
modulates how light reflects off the surface. This is something modern
graphics hardware can do extremely fast. Your metal surface can now be a low-
poly flat plane, and the screws, rivets, grooves and scratches will catch the
light and appear to have depth because of the texture.

![The screws, grooves and scratches are defined in a normalmap, which modifies
how light reflects off the surface of this low-poly plane, giving the
impression of 3D detail. As well as the rivets and screws, a texture allows us
to include far more detail like subtle bumps and
scratches.](../uploads/Main/StandardShaderNormalMapAircraftSurface.jpg) The
screws, grooves and scratches are defined in a normalmap, which modifies how
light reflects off the surface of this low-poly plane, giving the impression
of 3D detail. As well as the rivets and screws, a texture allows us to include
far more detail like subtle bumps and scratches.

In modern game development art pipelines, artists will use their 3D modelling
applications to generate normal maps based on very high resolution source
models. The normal maps are then mapped onto a lower-resolution game-ready
version of the model, so that the original high-resolution detail is rendered
using the normalmap.

## How normal mapping works

Normal mapping takes this modification of [surface
normals](StandardShaderMaterialParameterNormalMapSurfaceNormals.html) one step
further, by using a texture to store information about how to modify the
surface normals across the model. A normal map is an image texture mapped to
the surface of a model, similar to regular colour textures, however each
**pixel** The smallest unit in a computer image. Pixel size depends on your
screen resolution. Pixel lighting is calculated at every screen pixel. [More
info](ShadowPerformance.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#pixel) in the texture of the normal map
(called a **texel**) represents a deviation in surface normal direction away
from the “true” surface normal of the flat (or smooth interpolated) polygon.

![Normal mapping across three polygons, viewed as a 2D
diagram](../uploads/Main/BumpMapBumpShadingDiagram.svg) Normal mapping across
three polygons, viewed as a 2D diagram

In this diagram, which is again a 2D representation of three polygons on the
surface of a 3D model, each orange arrow corresponds to a pixel in the
normalmap texture. Below, is a single-pixel slice of a normalmap texture. In
the centre, you can see the normals have been modified, giving the
_appearance_ of a couple of bumps on the surface of the polygon. These bumps
would only be apparent due to the way lighting appears on the surface, because
these modified normals are used in the lighting calculations.

The colours visible in a raw normal map file typically have a blueish hue, and
don’t contain any actual light or dark shading - this is because the colours
themselves are not intended to be displayed as they are. Instead, the RGB
values of each texel represent the X,Y & Z values of a direction vector, and
are applied as a modification to the basic interpolated smooth normals of the
polygon surfaces.

![An example normal map texture](../uploads/Main/BumpMapTexturePreview.png) An
example normal map texture

This is a simple normal map, containing the bump information for some raised
rectangles and text. This normal map can be imported into Unity and placed
into Normal Map slot of the Standard **Shader** A program that runs on the
GPU. [More info](Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Shader). When combined in a material with a
colour map (the Albedo map) and applied to the surface of the cylinder
**mesh** The main graphics primitive of Unity. Meshes make up a large part of
your 3D worlds. Unity supports triangulated or Quadrangulated polygon meshes.
Nurbs, Nurms, Subdiv surfaces must be converted to polygons. [More
info](mesh.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Mesh) above, the result looks like this:

![The example normal map applied to the surface of the cylinder mesh used
above](../uploads/Main/BumpMapLitExample.jpg) The example normal map applied
to the surface of the cylinder mesh used above

Again, this does not affect the actual polygonal nature of the mesh, only how
the lighting is calculated on the surfaces. This apparent raised lettering and
shapes on the surface are not really present, and viewing the faces at
glancing angles will reveal the true nature of the flat surface, however from
most viewing angles the cylinder now appears to have embossed detail raised
off the surface.

## Difference between bump maps, normal maps and height maps

**Normal Maps** and **Height Maps** are both _types_ of Bump Map. They both
contain data for representing apparent detail on the surface of simpler
polygonal meshes, but they each store that data in a different way.

![On the left, a height map for bump mapping a stone wall. On the right, a
normal map for bump mapping a stone
wall.](../uploads/Main/BumpMapHeightMapNormalMapComparison.jpg) On the left, a
height map for bump mapping a stone wall. On the right, a normal map for bump
mapping a stone wall.

Above, on the left, you can see a height map used for bump mapping a stone
wall. A height map is a simple black and white texture, where each pixel
represents the amount that point on the surface should appear to be raised.
The whiter the pixel colour, the higher the area appears to be raised.

A normal map is an RGB texture, where each pixel represents the _difference in
direction_ the surface should appear to be facing, relative to its un-modified
surface normal. These textures tend to have a bluey-purple tinge, because of
the way the vector is stored in the RGB values.

Modern real-time 3D graphics hardware rely on Normal Maps, because they
contain the vectors required to modify how light should appear to bounce of
the surface. Unity can also accept Height Maps for bump mapping, but they must
be converted to Normal Maps on import in order to use them.

## Colors in a normal map

Understanding this is not vital for using normal maps! It’s ok to skip this
paragraph. However if you really want to know: The RGB colour values are used
to store the X,Y,Z direction of the vector, with Z being “up” (contrary to
Unity’s usual convention of using Y as “up”). In addition, the values in the
texture are treated as having been halved, with 0.5 added. This allows vectors
of all directions to be stored. Therefore to convert an RGB colour to a vector
direction, you must multiply by two, then subtract 1. For example, an RGB
value of (0.5, 0.5, 1) or #8080FF in hex results in a vector of (0,0,1) which
is “up” for the purposes of normal-mapping - and represents no change to the
surface of the model. This is the colour you see in the flat areas of the
“example” normal map earlier on this page.

![A normal map using only #8080FF, which translates to a normal vector of
0,0,1 or straight up. This applies no modification to the surface normal of
the polygon, and therefore produces no change to the lighting. Any pixels
which are different to this colour results in a vectors that point in a
different direction - which therefore modify the angle that is used to
calculate light bounce at that point.](../uploads/Main/BumpMapFlatColour.png)

are different to this colour results in a vectors that point in a different

bounce at that point.

A value of (0.43, 0.91, 0.80) gives a vector of (–0.14, 0.82, 0.6), which is
quite a steep modification to the surface. Colours like this can be seen in
the bright cyan areas of the stone wall normal map at the top of some of the
stone edges. The result is that these edges catch the light at a very
different angle to the flatter faces of the stones.

![The bright cyan areas in the normalmap for these stones show a steep
modification to the polygons surface normals at the top edge of each stone,
causing them to catch the light at the correct
angle.](../uploads/Main/BumpMapColourMapStoneWallExample.jpg) The bright cyan
areas in the normalmap for these stones show a steep modification to the
