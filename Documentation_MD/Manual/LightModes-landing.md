# Setting a light as realtime or baked

determines whether Unity calculates light in real time, or stores
precalculated light in the build.

**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Light Modes](LightModes-introduction.html)A Light property that defines the
use of the Light. Can be set to Realtime, Baked and Mixed. [More
info](LightModes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#LightMode) | Compare the differences between **realtime lights** Light components whose Mode property is set to Realtime. Unity calculates and updates the lighting of Realtime Lights every frame at runtime. No Realtime Lights are precomputed. [More info](LightModes-introduction.html#realtime)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#RealtimeLights), **baked lights** Light
components whose Mode property is set to Baked. Unity pre-calculates the
illumination from Baked Lights before runtime, and does not include them in
any runtime lighting calculations. [More info](LightModes-
introduction.html#baked)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#BakedLights), and mixed lights.  
[Choose a Light Mode](LightModes-choose.html) | Choose between realtime, baked, and mixed light modes for a Light component.
