# Constant Force component reference

[Switch to Scripting](../ScriptReference/ConstantForce.html "Go to
ConstantForce page in the Scripting Reference")

****Constant Force**** adds constant forces to a [Rigidbody](rigidbody-
physics-section.html)A component that allows a GameObject to be affected by
simulated gravity and other forces. [More info](class-Rigidbody.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Rigidbody). This is useful for **GameObject**
The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props,
scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined
by the Components attached to it. [More info](class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject) movement that accelerates over
time.

If you add a Constant Force component to a GameObject that does not have a
Rigidbody, Unity automatically creates and adds a Rigidbody to the same
GameObject.

For more details, see [Apply constant force to a Rigidbody](rigidbody-
constant-force.html).

## Properties

For all values, a higher value produces a stronger force, which in turn
produces a faster initial velocity.

**Property:** | **Function:**  
---|---  
**Force** | Define the direction of the linear force. The XYZ vectors refer to the **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene)’s global axes.  
**Relative Force** | Define the direction of the linear force. The XYZ vectors refer to the Rigidbody’s local axes.  
**Torque** | Define the global axes that the Rigidbody rotates around.  
**Relative Torque** | Define the local axes that the Rigidbody rotates around.
