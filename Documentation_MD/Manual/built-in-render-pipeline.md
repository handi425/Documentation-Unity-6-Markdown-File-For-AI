# Using the Built-In Render Pipeline

![](../uploads/Main/GraphicsIntroPic.png)

Unity’s Built-in Render Pipeline is Unity’s older render pipeline. It’s not
based on the Scriptable Render Pipeline, but you can configure it by choosing
between different [rendering paths](RenderingPaths.html)The technique that a
render pipeline uses to render graphics. Choosing a different rendering path
affects how lighting and shading are calculated. Some rendering paths are more
suited to different platforms and hardware than others. [More
info](RenderingPaths.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#RenderingPath), and extend its functionality
with [command buffers](GraphicsCommandBuffers.html) and
[callbacks](./execution-order.html).

**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Hardware requirements](RenderTech-HardwareRequirements.html) | Learn about general hardware requirements for the Built-In Render Pipeline, and requirements for realtime shadows, **post-processing** A process that improves product visuals by applying filters and effects before the image appears on screen. You can use post-processing effects to simulate physical camera and film properties, for example Bloom and Depth of Field. [More info](PostProcessingOverview.html) post processing, postprocessing, postprocess  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#post-processing) effects, and higher
**shader** A program that runs on the GPU. [More info](Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Shader) models.  
[Graphics quality settings](built-in-graphics-quality-settings.html) | Resources for understanding and configuring graphics tiers in the Built-In Render Pipeline.  
[Rendering paths](built-in-rendering-paths.html) | Resources for choosing between the Forward, Deferred and Legacy Vertex Lit rendering paths in the Built-In Render Pipeline.  
[Rendering order](built-in-rendering-order-landing.html) | Resources for using render queues and sorting behaviours to change how Unity renders **GameObjects** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject).  
[Custom rendering](GraphicsCommandBuffers-landing.html) | Resources for using the `CommandBuffer` API to schedule and execute rendering commands at various points in the Built-In Render Pipeline.
