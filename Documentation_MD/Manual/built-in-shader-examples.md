# HLSL shader examples in the Built-in Render Pipeline

This section contains example source code for hand-coded custom **shaders** A
program that runs on the GPU. [More info](Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Shader) that are compatible with the Built-in
**Render Pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene,
and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render
pipelines, or write your own. [More info](render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Renderpipeline).

**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Single color shader example](built-in-shader-examples-single-color.html) | Example of a shader that renders a single color.  
[Checkerboard pattern shader example](built-in-shader-examples-checkerboard.html) | Example of a shader that renders a checkerboard pattern.  
[Simple unlit shader example](built-in-shader-examples-unlit.html) | Example of a shader that renders an unlit texture.  
[Mesh normals shader example](built-in-shader-examples-mesh-normals.html) | Example of a shader that renders **mesh** The main graphics primitive of Unity. Meshes make up a large part of your 3D worlds. Unity supports triangulated or Quadrangulated polygon meshes. Nurbs, Nurms, Subdiv surfaces must be converted to polygons. [More info](mesh.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Mesh) normals as colors.  
[Reflections shader example](built-in-shader-examples-reflections.html) | Example of a shader that renders a reflection of the sky.  
[Normal map texture shader example](built-in-shader-examples-environment-reflections.html) | Example of a shader that uses a **normal map** A type of Bump Map texture that allows you to add surface detail such as bumps, grooves, and scratches to a model which catch the light as if they are represented by real geometry.  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Normalmap) texture to render reflections.  
[Tri-planar texturing shader example](built-in-shader-examples-tri-planar-texturing.html) | Example of a shader that projects a texture onto an object.  
[Simple diffuse lighting shader example](built-in-shader-examples-simple-diffuse-lighting.html) | Example of a shader that uses simple diffuse lighting.  
[Ambient light shader example](built-in-shader-examples-diffuse-lighting-with-ambient-light.html) | Example of a shader that uses **ambient light** Light that doesn’t come from any specific direction, and contributes equal light in all directions to the Scene. [More info](lighting-window.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Ambientlight).  
[Shadow casting shader example](built-in-shader-examples-shadow-casting.html) | Example of a shader that casts shadows.  
[Receiving shadows shader example](built-in-shader-examples-receive-shadows.html) | Example of a shader that does shadow calculations.  
[Fog shader example](built-in-shader-examples-fog.html) | Example of a shader that renders fog.  
[Visualizing vertex data shader examples](built-in-shader-examples-vertex-data.html) | Examples of shaders that render the UVs, normals, colors, tangents, and binormals of vertices.
