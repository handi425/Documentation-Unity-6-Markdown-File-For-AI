# Roslyn analyzers and source generators

Use Roslyn analyzers, source generators and ruleset files in Unity projects to
inspect your code for style, quality, and other issues.

You can use existing analyzer libraries to inspect your code, and write your
own analyzers to promote the best practices or conventions within your
organization.

**Note** : Roslyn analyzers are only compatible with the IDEs that Unity
publicly supports, which are Visual Studio and JetBrains Rider.

For more information about how to write and use Roslyn analyzers, refer to
Microsoft’s [Analyzer Configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-
us/visualstudio/code-quality/use-roslyn-analyzers?view=vs-2019) and [Get
started with Roslyn analyzers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-
us/visualstudio/extensibility/getting-started-with-roslyn-
analyzers?view=vs-2019) documentation.
