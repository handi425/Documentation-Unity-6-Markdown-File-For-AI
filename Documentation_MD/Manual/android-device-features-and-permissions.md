# Device features and permissions

For an application to access private data on the device, use device features
like an in-built microphone or **camera** A component which creates an image
of a particular viewpoint in your scene. The output is either drawn to the
screen or captured as a texture. [More info](CamerasOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Camera), or generally interact with the device
outside of the application sandbox, it must have permission from the device’s
user.

For more information about permissions on Android devices, see [Permissions on
Android](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/permissions/overview).
