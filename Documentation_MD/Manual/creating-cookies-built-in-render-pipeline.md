# Create cookies in the Built-In Render Pipeline

The most convenient way to create a [cookie](Cookies.html) for use with the
Built-in **Render Pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of
a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built
render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) is to create a grayscale
texture, import that texture to Unity, and then let Unity convert the
texture’s brightness to alpha.

Note that in the Built-in Render Pipeline, cookies only use data from the
alpha channel. This means that you can define a shape for a cookie, but not a
color.

![A simple grayscale cookie for a window light](../uploads/Main/Cookie.png) A

from a window](../uploads/Main/CookieExample.png) The same cookie simulating
light from a window

To do this:

  1. Create a grayscale texture in the image editor of your choice. If you are creating a cookie to use with a Point Light, lay your texture out as a **cubemap** A collection of six square textures that can represent the reflections in an environment or the skybox drawn behind your geometry. The six squares form the faces of an imaginary cube that surrounds an object; each face represents the view along the directions of the world axes (up, down, left, right, forward and back). [More info](class-Cubemap-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Cubemap). If you are creating a cookie to use
with a Spot Light or Directional Light, lay your texture out as a regular 2D
texture.

  2. Place the texture in your Project’s Asset folder to import the texture into Unity.
  3. In your Project view, select the Texture Asset that represents the texture. Unity displays the [Texture import settings](class-TextureImporter.html) in the **Inspector** A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. [More info](UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Inspector).

  4. In the Inspector, set the following values: 
     * Set **Texture Type** to **Cookie**
     * Set **Light Type** to match the Type of the Light that you are creating the cookie for
     * Set **Alpha Source** to **From Gray Scale**
  5. At the bottom of the Inspector, click **Apply**. Unity applies the updated import settings to the Texture Asset.

Note that the **pixels** The smallest unit in a computer image. Pixel size
depends on your screen resolution. Pixel lighting is calculated at every
screen pixel. [More info](ShadowPerformance.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#pixel) of a cookie does not need to be
completely transparent or opaque, but can also incorporate any values in
between. You can use in-between values to simulate dust or dirt in the path of
the light, or to simulate caustic effects such as those produced by the ridges
in a car’s headlight.

For more information on configuring the import settings for cookies in the
Built-in Render Pipeline, see [Texture Type: Cookie](texture-type-
cookie.html).

## Limitations

In the Built-In Render Pipeline, [VertexLit](Built-inShaderGuide.html)
**shaders** A program that runs on the GPU. [More info](Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Shader) can’t display Cookies or Shadows.

Shadows are disabled for directional lights with cookies when **forward
rendering** A rendering path that renders each object in one or more passes,
depending on lights that affect the object. Lights themselves are also treated
differently by Forward Rendering, depending on their settings and intensity.
[More info](RenderTech-ForwardRendering.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#ForwardRendering) is used. It’s possible to
write custom shaders to enable shadows in this case; see documentation on
[writing surface shaders](SL-SurfaceShaders.html) for further details.
