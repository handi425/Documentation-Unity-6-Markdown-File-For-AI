Tiles for tilemaps

# Troubleshoot mismatched Cell Layouts

When you create a **tilemap** A GameObject that allows you to quickly create
2D levels using tiles and a grid overlay. [More info](../../tilemaps/work-
with-tilemaps/tilemap-reference.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#Tilemap) in an existing Grid
**GameObject** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent
characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s
functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More
info](../../class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#GameObject), it is possible to try to
create a tilemap that uses a different **Cell Layout** to the Grid. If this
happens, Unity detects the mismatch in the **Cell Layouts** and a dialog
appears. The dialog prompts you to decide if you want to continue creating the
child tilemap or stop the action.

Select **Continue** to continue creating the child tilemap, and Unity changes
the parent Grid’s **Cell Layout** to match the child’s. Alternately you can
select **Cancel** to stop creating the new child tilemap.

**Note:** If you are running the Unity Editor in [headless
mode](../../EditorCommandLineArguments.html), this dialog won’t appear and the
Editor creates the tilemaps automatically as if you have selected
**Continue**.
