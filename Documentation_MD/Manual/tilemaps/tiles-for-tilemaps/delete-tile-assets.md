Scriptable Tile assets

# Delete tile assets

When you delete tile assets in their save location, the **Tile Palette**
editor replaces them with placeholder tiles in the tile palette and
**tilemaps** A GameObject that allows you to quickly create 2D levels using
tiles and a grid overlay. [More info](../../tilemaps/work-with-
tilemaps/tilemap-reference.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#Tilemap).

Each deleted tile asset has a corresponding placeholder tile with a unique
shade of pink that differentiates the placeholders from each other. On the
tilemap, these placeholder tiles remain in the original position of the
deleted tiles. This helps you to identify the deleted tile assets and the
areas on the tilemaps they affect.
