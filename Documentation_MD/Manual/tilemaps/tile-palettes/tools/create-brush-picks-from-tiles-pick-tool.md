# Create Brush Picks from tiles with the Pick tool

Use the **Pick** tool to select a tile or tiles from the **tilemap** A
GameObject that allows you to quickly create 2D levels using tiles and a grid
overlay. [More info](../../../tilemaps/work-with-tilemaps/tilemap-
reference.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../../Glossary.html#Tilemap) or tile palette, which you
can store as [Brush Picks](../brushes/brush-picks/brush-picks.html). Stored
Brush Picks keep their specific Brush settings and you can load them when
needed.

  1. Select the **Pick** tool from the **toolbar** A row of buttons and basic controls at the top of the Unity Editor that allows you to interact with the Editor in various ways (e.g. scaling, translation). [More info](../../../Toolbar.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../../Glossary.html#Toolbar), or press its shortcut key
**I**.

  2. Select tiles on the **Tile Palette** window or the tilemap in the ****Scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](../../../CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../../Glossary.html#Scene)** view with the **Pick** tool.
Click and drag the tool over several cells or tiles to select more at once.

  3. The **Pick** tool automatically switches to the [Paint tool](./paint-tiles-with-paint-tool.html) after you select the tile(s), and you can then paint the selected tile(s) onto the tilemap.
