# Paint tiles with the Paint tool

Use the **Paint** tool to select tiles and then paint them onto the
**tilemap** A GameObject that allows you to quickly create 2D levels using
tiles and a grid overlay. [More info](../../../tilemaps/work-with-
tilemaps/tilemap-reference.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../../Glossary.html#Tilemap).

  1. Select the **Paint** tool from the **toolbar** A row of buttons and basic controls at the top of the Unity Editor that allows you to interact with the Editor in various ways (e.g. scaling, translation). [More info](../../../Toolbar.html)

  2. Select a tile from the **Tile Palette** window and paint it onto the tilemap in the ****Scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](../../../CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../../Glossary.html#Scene)** view with the **Paint**
tool. To paint with more than one tile, hold and drag the **Paint** tool over
multiple tiles to select them all, then paint with them.

  3. To select tiles that are on the tilemap instead of the **Tile Palette** window, hold **Ctrl** to temporarily switch to the [Pick tool](./create-brush-picks-from-tiles-pick-tool.html) and pick tiles on the tilemap. After selecting the tile(s), release **Ctrl** to return to the **Paint** tool and paint with the selected tiles.

  4. To erase tiles, hold **Shift** to temporarily switch to the [Eraser tool](./remove-tiles-with-eraser-tool.html) and select tiles on the tilemap that you want to remove. Release **Shift** to return to the **Paint** tool**.
