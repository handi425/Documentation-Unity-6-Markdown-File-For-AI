# Select tiles with the Select tool

Use the **Select** tool to select tiles on the **tilemap** A GameObject that
allows you to quickly create 2D levels using tiles and a grid overlay. [More
info](../../../../tilemaps/work-with-tilemaps/tilemap-reference.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../../../Glossary.html#Tilemap) by selecting the cell the
tile is on. You can also click and drag the tool over several cells to select
them all at once.

The [Grid Selection properties](./grid-selection-properties-reference.html)
become available in the ****Inspector** A Unity window that displays
information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project
settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. [More
info](../../../../UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../../../Glossary.html#Inspector)** window for the cells
you select with the **Select** tool. You can further change cell contents with
the **gizmos** A graphic overlay associated with a GameObject in a Scene, and
displayed in the Scene View. Built-in scene tools such as the move tool are
Gizmos, and you can create custom Gizmos using textures or scripting. Some
Gizmos are only drawn when the GameObject is selected, while other Gizmos are
drawn by the Editor regardless of which GameObjects are selected. [More
info](../../../../GizmosMenu.html#GizmosIcons)  
See in [Glossary](../../../../Glossary.html#Gizmo) and options available in
the [Modify Tilemap section](./modify-tilemap-reference.html).

  1. Select the **Select** tool from the toolbar, or press its shortcut key **S**.

become available for the selected cells in the [Grid Selection
Properties](./grid-selection-properties-reference.html) and [Modify
Tilemap](./modify-tilemap-reference.html) sections. Refer to their respective
documentation to learn how you can adjust their properties and options.
