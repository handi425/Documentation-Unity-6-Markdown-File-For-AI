# Work with Brush Picks

The following steps explain how to save and load a Brush Pick, and edit or
remove a Brush Pick.

## Save a Brush Pick

![If there are no saved Brush Picks, the overlay displays instructions on how
to save a Brush Pick.](../../../../../uploads/Main/tile-palette-brush-pick-
empty.png) If there are no saved Brush Picks, the overlay displays
instructions on how to save a Brush Pick.

To save a Brush Pick:

  1. Activate the [Pick Tool](../../tools/create-brush-picks-from-tiles-pick-tool.html) in the [Tile Palette](../../create-tile-palette.html) window.
  2. Pick tiles with the [active brush](../active-brush.html) from the **Tile Palette** window or the ****Scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](../../../../CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../../../Glossary.html#Scene)** view. You can also adjust
the brush’s settings in the [Brush Inspector window](../brush-inspector-
reference.html).

  3. Select the [Save button](./brush-picks-overlay-reference.html) in the Brush Pick overlay to save the picked tiles and brush settings as a Brush Pick.

## Edit a Brush Pick

To rename a Brush Pick:

  1. Double-click the Brush Pick to edit the Brush Pick’s name.

To remove a Brush Pick:

  1. Select the Brush Pick you want to remove.
  2. Press Del (macOS: Cmd+Del) to remove the selected Brush Pick.

## Load a Brush Pick

To load a Brush Pick:

  1. Select its thumbnail in the [overlay](./brush-picks-overlay-reference.html). Selecting a Brush Pick automatically switches your [active brush](../brush-inspector-reference.html) to match the Brush Pick’s **Brush** type, and load its stored brush settings.
  2. Loading the Brush Pick automatically activates the [Paint tool](../../tools/paint-tiles-with-paint-tool.html), allowing you to paint with the Brush Pick straight away.
