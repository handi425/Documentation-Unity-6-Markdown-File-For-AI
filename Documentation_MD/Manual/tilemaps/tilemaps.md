# Tilemaps

Unity’s **Tilemap** A GameObject that allows you to quickly create 2D levels
using tiles and a grid overlay. [More info](../tilemaps/work-with-
tilemaps/tilemap-reference.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Tilemap) system stores and handles [Tile
Assets](tiles-for-tilemaps/tile-asset-reference.html) for creating 2D levels,
which makes it easy to create and iterate level design cycles within Unity.
The Tilemap system transfers the required information from the Tiles placed on
it to other related components such as the [Tilemap Renderer](work-with-
tilemaps/tilemap-renderer-reference.html) and the [Tilemap Collider 2D](work-
with-tilemaps/tilemap-collider-2d-reference.html).

By default, the Tilemap package isn’t included in the Unity Editor, so you
must download the **2D Tilemap** Editor package from the [Package
Manager](../Packages.html).

When you create a Tilemap, the Grid component is automatically parented to the
Tilemap and acts as a guide when you lay out Tiles onto the Tilemap. To
create, change, or pick the Tiles for painting onto a Tilemap, use the **Tile
Palette** (menu: **Window** > **2D** > **Tile Palette**) and its tools. For
more information, refer to [Creating a Tile Palette](tile-palettes/create-
tile-palette.html) and the [Tile Palette editor reference](tile-palettes/tile-
palette-editor-reference.html).

## Render Pipeline Compatibility

Tilemaps are supported by all **render pipeline** A series of operations that
take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you
choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More
info](../render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) that support 2D projects.

**Feature name** | **Universal Render Pipeline (URP)** | **High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP)** | **Built-in Render Pipeline**  
---|---|---|---  
Tilemaps | Yes | Yes | No
