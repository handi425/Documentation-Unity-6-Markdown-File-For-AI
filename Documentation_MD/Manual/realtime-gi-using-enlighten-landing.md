Introduction to Realtime Global Illumination using Enlighten

# Creating lightmaps at runtime with Enlighten Realtime Global Illumination

Resources for using **Enlighten** A lighting system by Geomerics used in Unity
for Enlighten Realtime Global Illumination. [More
info](https://www.siliconstudio.co.jp/en/products-service/enlighten/)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Enlighten) to precalculate visibility
information, then create and update **lightmaps** A pre-rendered texture that
contains the effects of light sources on static objects in the scene.
Lightmaps are overlaid on top of scene geometry to create the effect of
lighting. [More info](Lightmapping.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Lightmap) at runtime.

**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Realtime Global Illumination using Enlighten](realtime-gi-using-enlighten.html) | Learn about when to use Enlighten Realtime **Global Illumination** A group of techniques that model both direct and indirect lighting to provide realistic lighting results.  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#globalillumination), and how it generates
lightmaps.  
[Enable Enlighten Realtime Global Illumination](realtime-gi-using-enlighten-use.html) | Enable realtime lightmaps in a **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene), and set whether specific light
components contribute to indirect lighting.  
[Optimize Enlighten Realtime Global Illumination](realtime-gi-using-enlighten-optimize.html) | Configure Enlighten Realtime Global Illumination to use less memory or CPU time.  
[Level of detail (LOD) and Enlighten Realtime Global Illumination](LODRealtimeGI.html) | Learn about how Unity creates lightmaps for high and low detail models in the **level of detail** The _Level Of Detail_ (LOD) technique is an optimization that reduces the number of triangles that Unity has to render for a GameObject when its distance from the Camera increases. [More info](LevelOfDetail.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#levelofdetail) (LOD) system.  
[Global Illumination Profiler module](ProfilerGI.html) | Reference for the Global Illumination **Profiler** A window that helps you to optimize your game. It shows how much time is spent in the various areas of your game. For example, it can report the percentage of time spent rendering, animating, or in your game logic. [More info](Profiler.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Profiler) module, which displays statistics
about how much CPU time the Enlighten Realtime Global Illumination subsystem
uses.
