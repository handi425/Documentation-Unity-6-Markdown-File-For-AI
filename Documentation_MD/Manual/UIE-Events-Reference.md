# Event reference

UI Toolkit raises an event when a user interacts with and changes the state of
elements from **UI**(User Interface) Allows a user to interact with your
application. Unity currently supports three UI systems. [More info](UI-system-
compare.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#UI) Toolkit. The event design is similar to
the [Event interface](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event)
for HTML elements.

Event types fit into a hierarchy based on the
[EventBase](../ScriptReference/UIElements.EventBase.html) class. Each event
family implements an interface that defines the common characteristics of all
events of the same family. For example, `BlurEvent` and `FocusEvent` use the
[FocusEventBase](../ScriptReference/UIElements.FocusEventBase_1.html) class.

Select any of the event types listed below for more information on the event,
its parent class, and links to the API documentation.
