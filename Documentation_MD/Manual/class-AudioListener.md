# Audio Listener

[Switch to Scripting](../ScriptReference/AudioListener.html "Go to
AudioListener page in the Scripting Reference")

The **Audio Listener** acts as a microphone-like device. It receives input
from any given [Audio Source](class-AudioSource.html)A component which plays
back an Audio Clip in the scene to an audio listener or through an audio
mixer. [More info](class-AudioSource.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#AudioSource) in the **scene** A Scene contains
the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a
unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and
decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More
info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene) and plays sounds through the computer
speakers. For most applications it makes the most sense to attach the listener
to the Main [Camera](class-Camera.html)A component which creates an image of a
particular viewpoint in your scene. The output is either drawn to the screen
or captured as a texture. [More info](CamerasOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Camera). If an audio listener is within the
boundaries of a [Reverb Zone](class-AudioReverbZone.html) reverberation is
applied to all audible sounds in the scene. Furthermore, [Audio
Effects](class-AudioEffect.html)Any effect that can modify the output of Audio
Mixer components, such as filtering frequency ranges of a sound or applying
reverb. [More info](class-AudioEffectMixer.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#AudioEffect) can be applied to the listener
and it will be applied to all audible sounds in the scene.

## Properties

The Audio Listener has no properties. It simply must be added to work. It is
always added to the Main Camera by default.

## Details

The Audio Listener works in conjunction with [Audio Sources](class-
AudioSource.html), allowing you to create the aural experience for your games.
When the Audio Listener is attached to a **GameObject** The fundamental object
in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras,
waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components
attached to it. [More info](class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject) in your scene, any Sources that
are close enough to the Listener will be picked up and output to the
computer’s speakers. Each scene can only have 1 Audio Listener to work
properly.

If the Sources are 3D (see import settings in [Audio Clip](class-
AudioClip.html)A container for audio data in Unity. Unity supports mono,
stereo and multichannel audio assets (up to eight channels). Unity can import
.aif, .wav, .mp3, and .ogg audio file format, and .xm, .mod, .it, and .s3m
tracker module formats. [More info](class-AudioClip.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#AudioClip)), the Listener will emulate
position, velocity and orientation of the sound in the 3D world (You can tweak
attenuation and 3D/2D behavior in great detail in [Audio Source](class-
AudioSource.html)) . 2D will ignore any 3D processing. For example, if your
character walks off a street into a night club, the night club’s music should
probably be 2D, while the individual voices of characters in the club should
be mono with their realistic positioning being handled by Unity.

You should attach the Audio Listener to either the Main Camera or to the
GameObject that represents the player. Try both to find what suits your game
best.

## Hints

  * Each scene can only have one Audio Listener.
  * You access the Project-wide Audio settings using the [Audio](class-AudioManager.html) window (main menu: **Edit** > **Project Settings** , then select the **Audio** category).
  * View the [Audio Clip](class-AudioClip.html) Component page for more information about Mono vs Stereo sounds.
