# Scene template settings

To access the scene template Project settings, open the **Project Settings**
window (menu: **Edit** > **Project Settings**) and choose **Scene Template**
from the category list.

![](../uploads/Main/scene-template-settings.png)  
_The**scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think
of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your
environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building
your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene) template **Project settings** A broad
collection of settings which allow you to configure how Physics, Audio,
Networking, Graphics, Input and many other areas of your project behave. [More
info](comp-ManagerGroup.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#ProjectSettings) panel_

## New Scene settings

The New Scene settings (1) control what happens when you create a new scene
from the File menu: (**File** > **New Scene**) or using the **Ctrl/Cmd + n**
shortcut.

**Option:** | **Description:**  
---|---  
**New Scene menu** |   
| New Scene Dialog | Opens the New Scene dialog.  
| Built-in Scene | Creates a new scene without opening the New Scene dialog. The new scene is a copy of the Project’s Basic template.  
  
## Default Types settings

The **Default Types** settings control whether Unity clones specific types of
asset by default when it creates a new scene from a scene template.

To make Unity clone a specific type of asset by default, enable the **Clone**
option (2) for that asset type in the list.

To make Unity reference a specific type of asset by default, disable the
**Clone** option (2) for that asset type in the list.

To set the default clone/reference behavior for asset types that do not appear
in the list, enable/disable the **Clone** option for **All Other Types** (3).

To remove an asset type from the list, click the **Remove** button (4).

To add an asset type to the list, do one of the following: \- In the **Add
Type** field (5), enter a specific asset type. \- Click the **Browse** button
(6) to open a search window where you can find and select a specific asset
type.

Then click the **Add** button (7) to add the asset type to the list.

To revert to Unity’s default asset type list and settings, click the **Reset
Defaults** button (8).
