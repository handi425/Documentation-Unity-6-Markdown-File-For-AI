Scriptable Render Pipeline (SRP) Batcher in URP

# Optimizing draw calls in URP

Techniques for speeding up rendering by reducing the number of drawing
commands the CPU sends to the GPU, in the Universal **Render Pipeline** A
series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a
screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your
own. [More info](render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) (URP).
