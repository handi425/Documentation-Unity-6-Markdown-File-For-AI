# Physics Material asset reference

[Switch to Scripting](../ScriptReference/PhysicsMaterial.html "Go to
PhysicsMaterial page in the Scripting Reference")

The ****Physics Material**** is a material asset that you can place on a
**GameObject** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent
characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s
functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](class-
GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject). The material defines properties
on the **collider** An invisible shape that is used to handle physical
collisions for an object. A collider doesn’t need to be exactly the same shape
as the object’s mesh - a rough approximation is often more efficient and
indistinguishable in gameplay. [More info](CollidersOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Collider)’s surface, such as friction and
bounciness.

To create a Physics Material, go to **Assets** > **Create** > **Physics
Material** , then drag the Physics Material from the Project window onto a
collider in the scene.

If there is no Physics Material set, a collider uses the default surface
settings. To adjust the project’s default settings, use the [Physics
Settings](class-PhysicsManager.html).

**Property** | **Description**  
---|---  
**Dynamic Friction** | Define how much friction the collider’s surface has against another collider when the colliders are moving or sliding against each other. This value is between 0 and 1. A value of 0 means no friction (like ice), while a value of 1 means very high friction (like rubber). By default, **Dynamic Friction** is set to 0.6.   
  
Unity uses the friction value of both touching colliders to calculate the
friction between them, based on the **Friction Combine** property (below).  
**Static Friction** | Define how much friction the collider’s surface has against another collider when the colliders are not moving. This value is between 0 and 1. A value of 0 means no friction (like ice), while a value of 1 means very high friction (like rubber). By default, **Static Friction** is set to 0.6.   
  
Unity uses the friction value of both touching colliders to calculate the
friction between them, based on the **Friction Combine** property (below).  
**Bounciness** | Define how bouncy the surface is, and how much other colliders can bounce off it. A value of 0 means the surface is not at all bouncy (like soft clay), and other colliders lose kinetic energy upon hitting it. A value of 1 means the surface is very bouncy (like rubber), and other colliders bounce without any loss of kinetic energy. By default, **Bounciness** is set to 0.   
  
Unity uses the bounciness value of both touching colliders to calculate the
bounce between them, based on the **Bounce Combine** property.  
  
Note that the physics system’s bounce approximations might still add small
amounts of energy to the simulation.  
**Friction Combine** | Define how the physics system calculates friction between two colliders, based on each collider’s friction. This selection applies to both **Dynamic Friction** and Static Friction. By default, **Friction Combine** is set to **Average**. For details, refer to [How collider surface values combine](collider-surfaces-combine.html).  
**Bounce Combine** | Define how the physics system calculates bounce between two colliders, based on each collider’s **Bounciness** value. By default, **Bounce Combine** is set to **Average**. For details, refer to [How collider surface values combine](collider-surfaces-combine.html).
