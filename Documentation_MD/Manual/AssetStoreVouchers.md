# Issuing vouchers

You can give a customer one of your paid packages for free by creating a
voucher on your Publisher Account and giving them the voucher code so they can
redeem it. You can create up to 12 vouchers per year for each Asset.

**Note:** You can only give vouchers away for free. You cannot sell them or
exchange them.

To issue a voucher:

  1. Open the [Asset Store Publisher](https://publisher.assetstore.unity3d.com/) portal and navigate to the **Vouchers** tab.

![The Free Package Vouchers is where you issue and review free vouchers for

  2. Select the package you want to create a voucher for. 

  3. Click the **Create Voucher** button and follow the instructions.
