# Light Explorer window

The Light Explorer window allows you to select and edit light sources. To open
the **Light Explorer** window from the menu, navigate to **Window** >
**Rendering** > **Light Explorer**.

Use the five tabs at the top of the panel to view settings for the
[lights](class-Light.html), [2D lights](urp/Lights-2D-intro.html), [Reflection
Probes](class-ReflectionProbe.html)A rendering component that captures a
spherical view of its surroundings in all directions, rather like a camera.
The captured image is then stored as a Cubemap that can be used by objects
with reflective materials. [More info](class-ReflectionProbe.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#ReflectionProbe), [light
probes](LightProbes.html)Light probes store information about how light passes
through space in your scene. A collection of light probes arranged within a
given space can improve lighting on moving objects and static LOD scenery
within that space. [More info](LightProbes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#LightProbe), and static emissive materials in
the current **Scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your
game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you
place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and
building your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene). The editable parameters are the most
commonly-used fields for each component type.

To avoid having to scroll the window a lot when you have many lights in a
scene, select the lights you want to work on, then select **Isolate
Selection**. Unity removes the other lights from the window until you disable
**Isolate Selection** again.
