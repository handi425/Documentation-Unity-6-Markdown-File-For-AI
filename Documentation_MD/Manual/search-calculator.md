# The calculator

The Calculator Search Provider computes expressions directly in Search. Enter
any expression that is valid in a numerical text field in Unity, and Search
displays the result in the results area.

**NOTE:** This search requires a search token to execute it. You cannot make
it an [active Search Provider](search-filters.html#persistent-search-filters),
or combine it with other Search Providers.

**[Search token](search-filters.html#search-tokens):** `=` (equals sign)

**[Default action](search-usage.html#default-actions):** Logs the result of
the expression to the console, and copies it to the clipboard.

**[Context menu actions](search-usage.html#additional-actions):**

Action: | Function:  
---|---  
**Exec** | Logs the result of the expression to the console, and copies it to the clipboard.  
  
> **Note:** To query this provider you need to explicitly add `=` to the
> query.  
  
---  
**Supported operators** | `+ - * / % ^ ( )` |  **Example:**  
`=42/34 + (56 % 6)`  
  
`=23 * 9 ^ 3`
