Built-in 3D Physics

# Physics

![](../uploads/Main/PhysicsIntroPic.jpg)

Unity helps you simulate physics in your Project to ensure that the objects
correctly accelerate and respond to **collisions** A collision occurs when the
physics engine detects that the colliders of two GameObjects make contact or
overlap, when at least one has a Rigidbody component and is in motion. [More
info](CollidersOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Collision), gravity, and various other forces.
Unity provides different **physics engine** implementations which you can use
according to your Project needs: 3D, 2D, object-oriented, or data-oriented.
This page provides the links to their documentation.

You can achieve some basic physics goals with the user interface, but for more
control over the simulation, you need some familiarity with C#. To develop
your C# skills, see the Unity Learn [Junior
Programmer](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/junior-programmer) course.

## Built-in physics engines for object-oriented projects

If your project is object-oriented, use the Unity’s built-in physics engine
that corresponds to your needs:

  * [Built-in 3D physics](PhysicsOverview.html) (Nvidia PhysX engine integration)
  * [Built-in 2D physics](2d-physics/2d-physics.html) (Box2D engine integration)

## Physics engine packages for data-oriented projects

If your project uses Unity’s Data-Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS), you need
to install a dedicated DOTS physics package. The available packages are:

  * [Unity Physics](http://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.physics@latest/index.html) package: the DOTS physics engine you need to install by default to simulate physics in any data-oriented project.
  * [Havok Physics for Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.havok.physics@latest/index.html) package: an implementation of the Havok physics engine for Unity, to use as an extension of the Unity Physics package. Note that this package is subject to a specific licensing scheme.
