# Importing local asset packages

If you have an asset package (`.unitypackage` file) saved locally, after
[creating your own custom asset package](AssetPackagesCreate.html), you can
import it into your project in the Unity Editor by using the **Assets** Any
media or data that can be used in your game or project. An asset may come from
a file created outside of Unity, such as a 3D Model, an audio file or an
image. You can also create some asset types in Unity, such as an Animator
Controller, an Audio Mixer or a Render Texture. [More
info](AssetWorkflow.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Asset) menu.

**Note** : For information about using the Package Manager window to import an
asset package you purchased or downloaded from the **Asset Store** A growing
library of free and commercial assets created by Unity and members of the
community. Offers a wide variety of assets, from textures, models and
animations to whole project examples, tutorials and Editor extensions. [More
info](AssetStore.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#AssetStore), refer to [Download and import an
asset package](upm-ui-import.html).

To import a local asset package in Unity:

  1. Open the project in the Editor where you want to import the asset package.

  2. Choose **Assets** > **Import Package** > **Custom Package**. A file browser appears, prompting you to locate the `.unitypackage` file.

  3. In the file browser, select the file you want to import and click **Open**.

The **Import Unity Package** window displays all the items in the package
already selected, ready to install.

  4. Deselect any items you don’t want to import and click **Import**. Unity puts the contents of the imported asset package into the `Assets` folder, so that you can access them from your **Project window** A window that shows the contents of your `Assets` folder (Project tab) [More info](ProjectView.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Projectwindow).

## Additional resources

  * [Asset packages](AssetPackages.html)A collection of files and data from Unity projects, or elements of projects, which are compressed and stored in one file, similar to Zip files, with the `.unitypackage` extension. Asset packages are a handy way of sharing and re-using Unity projects and collections of assets. [More info](AssetPackages.html)
