# Introduction to Light Probe Proxy Volumes in the Built-In Render Pipeline

[Switch to Scripting](../ScriptReference/LightProbeProxyVolume.html "Go to
LightProbeProxyVolume page in the Scripting Reference")

The **Light Probe Proxy Volume** (LPPV) component allows you to use more
lighting information for large dynamic **GameObjects** The fundamental object
in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras,
waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components
attached to it. [More info](class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject) that cannot use baked
**lightmaps** A pre-rendered texture that contains the effects of light
sources on static objects in the scene. Lightmaps are overlaid on top of scene
geometry to create the effect of lighting. [More info](Lightmapping.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Lightmap) (for example, large Particle Systems
or skinned Meshes).

By default, a probe-lit Renderer receives lighting from a single [Light
Probe](LightProbes.html)Light probes store information about how light passes
through space in your scene. A collection of light probes arranged within a
given space can improve lighting on moving objects and static LOD scenery
within that space. [More info](LightProbes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#LightProbe) that is interpolated between the
surrounding Light Probes in the **Scene** A Scene contains the environments
and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In
each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations,
essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More
info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene). Because of this, GameObjects have
constant ambient lighting across the surface. This lighting has a rotational
gradient because it is using spherical harmonics, but it lacks a spatial
gradient. This is more noticeable on larger GameObjects or **Particle
Systems** A component that simulates fluid entities such as liquids, clouds
and flames by generating and animating large numbers of small 2D images in the
scene. [More info](class-ParticleSystem.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#particlesystem). The lighting across the
GameObject matches the lighting at the anchor point, and if the GameObject
straddles a lighting gradient, parts of the GameObject may look incorrect.

The **Light Probe Proxy Volume** component generates a 3D grid of interpolated
Light Probes inside a **Bounding Volume** A closed shape representing the
edges and faces of a collider or trigger.  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Boundingvolume). You can specify the
resolution of this grid in the **UI**(User Interface) Allows a user to
interact with your application. Unity currently supports three UI systems.
[More info](UI-system-compare.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#UI) of the component. The spherical harmonics
(SH) coefficients of the interpolated Light Probes are uploaded into 3D
textures. The 3D textures containing SH coefficients are then sampled at
render time to compute the contribution to the diffuse ambient lighting. This
adds a spatial gradient to probe-lit GameObjects.

The [Standard Shader](shader-StandardShader.html) supports this feature. To
add this to a custom **shader** A program that runs on the GPU. [More
info](Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Shader), use the `ShadeSHPerPixel` function.
To learn how to implement this function, see the Particle System sample Shader
code example at the bottom of this page.

## Render pipeline support

See [render pipeline feature comparison](render-pipelines-feature-
comparison.html) for more information about support for the Light Probe Proxy
Volume component across **render pipelines** A series of operations that take
the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose
from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](render-
pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Renderpipeline).

## Images for comparison

  1. A simple **Mesh** The main graphics primitive of Unity. Meshes make up a large part of your 3D worlds. Unity supports triangulated or Quadrangulated polygon meshes. Nurbs, Nurms, Subdiv surfaces must be converted to polygons. [More info](mesh.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Mesh) Renderer using a Standard Shader:

4x1x1\)](../uploads/Main/LightProbeProxyVolumeExample1.png) With Light Probe
Proxy Volume (resolution: 4x1x1) ![Without Light Probe Proxy
Volume](../uploads/Main/LightProbeProxyVolumeExample2.png) Without Light Probe
Proxy Volume

  2. A skinned **Mesh Renderer** A mesh component that takes the geometry from the Mesh Filter and renders it at the position defined by the object’s Transform component. [More info](class-MeshRenderer.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#MeshRenderer) using a Standard Shader:

![With Light Probe Proxy Volume \(resolution:
2x2x2\)](../uploads/Main/LightProbeProxyVolumeExample3.png) With Light Probe
Proxy Volume (resolution: 2x2x2) ![Without Light Probe Proxy
Volume](../uploads/Main/LightProbeProxyVolumeExample4.png) Without Light Probe
Proxy Volume

## Hardware requirements

The component requires at least Shader Model 4 graphics hardware and API
support, including support for 3D Textures with 32-bit or 16-bit floating-
point format and linear filtering.

To work correctly, the Scene needs to contain Light Probes via **Light Probe
Group** A component that enables you to add Light Probes to GameObjects in
your scene. [More info](class-LightProbeGroup.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#LightProbeGroup) components. If a requirement
is not fulfilled, the Renderer or Light Probe Proxy Volume component
**Inspector** A Unity window that displays information about the currently
selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and
edit the values. [More info](UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Inspector) displays a warning message.
