Prebuilt shaders in the Built-In Render Pipeline

# Shaders in the Built-In Render Pipeline

Resources for using shaders in the Built-In **Render Pipeline** A series of
operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen.
Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own.
[More info](render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) to create materials for real-
world objects or particles.

[Prebuilt shaders](shader-built-in-birp.html) | Resources for using the Standard Shader, particle shaders or the Autodesk Interactive shader.  
[Replace shaders at runtime](shader-built-in-birp-landing.html) | Change the shader that a **camera** A component which creates an image of a particular viewpoint in your scene. The output is either drawn to the screen or captured as a texture. [More info](CamerasOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Camera) uses to render certain geometry at
runtime.  
[Writing custom shaders](writing-shaders-birp.html) | Resources for writing HLSL code and **Surface Shaders** A streamlined way of writing shaders for the Built-in Render Pipeline. [More info](SL-SurfaceShaders.html)

Pipeline.
