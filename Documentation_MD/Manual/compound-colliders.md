Introduction to compound colliders

# Compound colliders

Compound colliders are collections of multiple colliders on a single
**Rigidbody** A component that allows a GameObject to be affected by simulated
gravity and other forces. [More info](class-Rigidbody.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Rigidbody) **GameObject** The fundamental
object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery,
cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the
Components attached to it. [More info](class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject). Each **collider** An invisible
shape that is used to handle physical collisions for an object. A collider
doesn’t need to be exactly the same shape as the object’s mesh - a rough
approximation is often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay. [More
info](CollidersOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Collider) is attached to a child GameObject,
with the Rigidbody GameObject as its parent. This allows you to group and
arrange colliders into complex shapes, and have the physics system treat them
as a single [rigid body](RigidbodiesOverview.html).
