APK expansion files in Unity

# APK expansion files

APK expansion files are the asset splitting solution for the **APK** The
Android Package format output by Unity. An APK is automatically deployed to
your device when you select File > Build & Run. [More info](android-
BuildProcess.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#APK) publishing format. They enable an
application to split its assets into:

  * Core assets like **scripts** A piece of code that allows you to create your own Components, trigger game events, modify Component properties over time and respond to user input in any way you like. [More info](creating-scripts.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scripts), **plug-ins** A set of code created
outside of Unity that creates functionality in Unity. There are two kinds of
plug-ins you can use in Unity: Managed plug-ins (managed .NET assemblies
created with tools like Visual Studio) and Native plug-ins (platform-specific
native code libraries). [More info](./plug-ins.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Plug-in), and assets that the application
requires for the first **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus
of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each
Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially
designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene).

  * Additional assets like [Streaming Assets](StreamingAssets.html) and assets that the application requires for additional scenes.

The core assets go in the main APK file and the additional assets go in APK
expansion files.

[Digital distribution services](android-distribution.html) often have an
application size limit. This makes it necessary for APK applications that are
larger than the size limit to use APK expansion files. For example, Google
Play requires applications that are larger than 100MB to use APK expansion
files. It allows you to use two APK expansion files, the main APK expansion
file, and the patch APK expansion file, which can be up to 2GB each. For more
information, see [APK Expansion
Files](https://developer.android.com/google/play/expansion-files.html).

This section of the documentation introduces APK expansion files and explains
how to work with them in Unity.
