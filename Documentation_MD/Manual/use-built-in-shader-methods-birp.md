# Shader methods in the Built-In Render Pipeline

Resources for importing prebuilt **shader** A program that runs on the GPU.
[More info](Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Shader) files and using built-in shader
functions in the Built-In **Render Pipeline** A series of operations that take
the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose
from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More info](render-
pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Renderpipeline).

**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Import a file from the shader library](SL-BuiltinIncludes.html) | Import files that contain helper functions and macros, such as `UnityCG.cginc` and `HLSLSupport.cginc`.  
[Use built-in shader functions](SL-BuiltinFunctions.html) | Use built-in functions to transform positions and other values.
