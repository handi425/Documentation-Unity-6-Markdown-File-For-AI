Introduction to surface shaders in the Built-In Render Pipeline

# Writing Surface Shaders

Resources and techniques for writing Surface **Shaders** A program that runs
on the GPU. [More info](Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Shader) in the Built-In **Render Pipeline** A
series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a
screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your
own. [More info](render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Renderpipeline), which are streamlined shaders
that interact with lighting.

**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Introduction to Surface Shaders](SL-SurfaceShaders.html) | Learn about how **Surface Shaders** A streamlined way of writing shaders for the Built-in Render Pipeline. [More info](SL-SurfaceShaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#SurfaceShader) let you write shaders in a
streamlined way.  
[Surface Shader output structures](SL-SurfaceShaders-output.html) | Understand the structures Surface Shaders uses for input data, for example albedo color and surface normals.  
[Surface Shaders and rendering paths](SL-RenderPipeline.html) | Understand how the **rendering path** The technique that a render pipeline uses to render graphics. Choosing a different rendering path affects how lighting and shading are calculated. Some rendering paths are more suited to different platforms and hardware than others. [More info](RenderingPaths.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#RenderingPath) affects how Unity applies
lighting, and which passes Unity uses.  
[Create a Surface Shader](SL-SurfaceShader-create.html) | Create a Surface Shader using the `#pragma surface` directive.  
[Set the lighting model in a Surface Shader](SL-SurfaceShaderLighting.html) | Set the lighting to a built-in model, or define a custom lighting model.  
[Optimize Surface Shaders](SL-SurfaceShaderOptimize.html) | Make Surface Shaders run faster or reduce their file size.  
[Surface Shader examples](SL-SurfaceShaderExamples.html) | Examples of Surface Shaders in the Built-In Render Pipeline.  
[Surface Shader language reference](surface-shaders-language-reference.html) | Find the directives and input structures you need to write a Surface Shader in the Built-In Render Pipeline.
