Introduction to Mesh colliders

# Mesh colliders

The **Mesh** The main graphics primitive of Unity. Meshes make up a large part
of your 3D worlds. Unity supports triangulated or Quadrangulated polygon
meshes. Nurbs, Nurms, Subdiv surfaces must be converted to polygons. [More
info](mesh.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Mesh) **collider** An invisible shape that is
used to handle physical collisions for an object. A collider doesn’t need to
be exactly the same shape as the object’s mesh - a rough approximation is
often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay. [More
info](CollidersOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Collider) takes a [Mesh Asset](class-
Mesh.html) and builds a collider that matches the geometry of that Mesh. It is
more accurate for **collision** A collision occurs when the physics engine
detects that the colliders of two GameObjects make contact or overlap, when at
least one has a Rigidbody component and is in motion. [More
info](CollidersOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Collision) detection than primitive colliders,
and is a better option for complicated Meshes.
