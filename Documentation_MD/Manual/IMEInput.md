# IME in Unity

## What is Input Method Editor (IME)?

An input method is an operating system component or program that allows users
to enter characters and symbols not found on their input device. For instance,
on the computer, this allows the user of ‘Western’ keyboards to input Chinese,
Japanese, Korean and Indic characters. On many hand-held devices, such as
mobile phones, it enables using the numeric keypad to enter Latin alphabet
characters.

The term input method generally refers to a particular way to use the keyboard
to input a particular language, for example the [Cangjie
method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cangjie_input_method), the [pinyin
method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin_method), or the use of dead keys.

# IME and Unity

Unity provides IME support, which means that you can write non-ASCII
characters in all your graphical user interfaces. This Input Method is fully
integrated with the engine so you do not need to do anything to activate it.
In order to test it, just change your keyboard language to a non-ASCII
language (e.g. Japanese) and just start writing your interface.

For more information and optimization options for writing non-ASCII
characters, refer to [Font Asset properties reference](UIE-font-asset-
properties.html).
