Branching in shaders

# Changing how shaders work via branching and keywords

Sometimes, you want the same **shader** A program that runs on the GPU. [More
info](Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Shader) to do different things under different
circumstances. For example, you might want to configure different settings for
different materials, define functionality for different hardware, or
dynamically change the behavior of shaders at runtime. You might also want to
avoid executing computationally expensive code when it’s not needed, such as
texture reads, vertex inputs, interpolators, or loops.

You can use conditionals to define behavior that the GPU only executes under
certain conditions.

**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Shader branching](shader-branching.html) | Resources for using conditionals to create static and dynamic branches in shaders, and branch using built-in macros.  
[Shader keywords](shader-keywords-landing.html) | Resources and techniques for adding shader keywords, using them to create branches and shader variants, and toggling them in the Unity Editor or in a script.
