Customize movement constraint with Configurable Joints

# Create a configurable joint

To create a custom configurable **joint** A physics component allowing a
dynamic connection between Rigidbody components, usually allowing some degree
of movement such as a hinge. [More info](Joints.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#joint) and have fine control over behavior,
you can use the [Configurable Joint](class-ConfigurableJoint.html)An extremely
customizable joint that other joint types are derived from. It can be used to
create anything from adapted versions of existing joints to custom designed
and highly specialized joints. [More info](class-ConfigurableJoint.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#ConfigurableJoint). You can also use the
Configurable Joint to implement physics forces that drive a **GameObject** The
fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props,
scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined
by the Components attached to it. [More info](class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject) to a specific **target velocity**
A joint property to set the desired velocity with which the joint should move
to the Target Position under the drive force. [More info](class-
ConfigurableJoint.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#TargetVelocity) or position.

**Topic** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Customize movement constraint with Configurable Joints](configurable-joints-movement-constraint.html) | Use a custom joint to add limits to a GameObject’s movement or rotation, and configure how bouncy or elastic that limit is.  
[Driving forces with Configurable Joints](configurable-joints-driving-forces.html) | Use a custom joint to define the driving linear and rotational forces on a GameObject.  
[Configure driving forces on a Configurable Joint](configure-driving-forces.html) | Use the Configurable Joint to create custom targets and driving forces.  
[Configurable Joint component reference](class-ConfigurableJoint.html) | Property reference for the Configurable Joint component.  
  
Because the Configurable Joint has a lot of configuration options, you might
need to experiment and iterate with values to get the joint to behave exactly
the way you want.
