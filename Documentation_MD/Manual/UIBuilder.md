UI Builder interface overview

# UI Builder

UI Builder lets you visually create and edit **UI**(User Interface) Allows a
user to interact with your application. Unity currently supports three UI
systems. [More info](UI-system-compare.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#UI) assets, such as UI Documents (`.uxml`),
and StyleSheets (`.uss`), that you use with [UI Toolkit](UIElements.html).

You can also install the following optional packages that offer additional
functionality in UI Builder:

  * The `com.unity.vectorgraphics` package allows you to assign a `VectorImage` as a background style on an element.
  * The `com.unity.2d.sprite` package allows you to assign a 2D **Sprite** A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during development. [More info](sprite/sprite-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Sprite) asset (or sub-asset) as a background
style on an element. With the 2D Sprite package installed, you can also open
the 2D Sprite Editor directly from the ****Inspector** A Unity window that
displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project
settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. [More
info](UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Inspector)** pane.
