# Rendering to a texture

Resources for updating textures at runtime via **Render Textures** A special
type of Texture that is created and updated at runtime. To use them, first
create a new Render Texture and designate one of your Cameras to render into
it. Then you can use the Render Texture in a Material just like a regular
Texture. [More info](class-RenderTexture.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#RenderTexture) and Movie Textures.
