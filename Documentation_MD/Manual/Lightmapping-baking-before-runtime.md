Introduction to lightmaps and baking

# Baking lightmaps before runtime

Resources for precalculating the lit colors of **GameObjects** The fundamental
object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery,
cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the
Components attached to it. [More info](class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject) and storing them in textures
called **lightmaps** A pre-rendered texture that contains the effects of light
sources on static objects in the scene. Lightmaps are overlaid on top of scene
geometry to create the effect of lighting. [More info](Lightmapping.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Lightmap).

**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Lightmaps and baking](Lightmappers.html) | Learn about precalculating the color and brightness of surfaces in a **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene), then storing the result in a texture
called a lightmap for later use.  
[Set up your scene and lights for baking](Lightmapping.html) | Set up meshes and GameObjects so that they store precalculated color in lightmaps.  
[Preview baked lighting](Lightmapping-preview.html) | Edit a scene and preview changes to lightmaps and lighting without affecting the baked lightmaps.  
[Bake lighting](Lightmapping-bake.html) | Generate lightmaps for your scene.  
[Configuring baking lightmaps](Lightmapping-configure.html) | Resources for selecting CPU or GPU lightmapping, and changing how GameObjects store lighting in lightmaps.  
[Troubleshooting baked lightmaps](Lightmapping-troubleshooting.html) | Solve common issues with baked lightmaps, such as hard edges or light bleeding.  
[Optimize baked lightmaps](GPUProgressiveLightmapper.html) | Speed up baking time by configuring baking settings or selecting different GPUs for rendering and baking.  
[Lightmapping settings in the Lighting Settings Asset reference](Lightmaps-reference.html) | Explore the properties and settings in the Lighting Settings Asset window to customize baking lightmaps.
