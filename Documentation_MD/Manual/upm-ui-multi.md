# Perform an action on multiple packages

You can select multiple packages or **feature sets** A feature set is a
collection of related packages that you can use to achieve specific results in
the Unity Editor. You can manage feature sets directly in Unity’s Package
Manager. [More info](FeatureSets.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Featureset) in the Package Manager list panel
and perform an operation on all selected items at once.

For example, you can use this feature to update multiple packages to their
latest versions in one operation.

The following table lists shortcuts you can use to select multiple items.

**Selection type** | **Keyboard shortcut**  
---|---  
Select all items in the list | Command + a (macOS) or Ctrl + a (Windows and Linux).  
Select a range with keyboard and mouse | Select the first item in the range, hold the Shift key, then select the last item in the range.  
Select a range with arrows keys | Select the first item in the range, hold the Shift key, then use the Up arrow key or Down arrow key to extend the range.  
Select multiple items that aren’t grouped together | Select an item, hold Command (macOS) or Ctrl (Windows or Linux), then select additional items.  
  
To apply an operation to multiple packages or feature sets, follow these
steps:

  1. Open the Package Manager window and [select a context](upm-ui-filter.html) from the [navigation panel](upm-ui-nav.html).
  2. Optional: Use the [filter](upm-ui-filter2.html) controls to narrow your list.
  3. Optional: Use the [sort](upm-ui-sort.html) controls to order your list.
  4. Select multiple packages or feature sets from the list by using one of the shortcuts in the table above.
  5. Optional: Open the expander (![](../uploads/Main/iconCollapsed.png)) in the [details panel](upm-ui-details.html) to view more information about the selected items, such as the packages’ version number.
  6. Click the action button in the [details panel](upm-ui-details.html) to perform that operation on the selected items.
