Mono overview

# Scripting backends

Unity has two scripting back ends: **Mono** and ****IL2CPP** A Unity-developed
scripting back-end which you can use as an alternative to Mono when building
projects for some platforms. [More info](./scripting-backends-il2cpp.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#IL2CPP)** (Intermediate Language To C++), each
of which uses a different compilation technique:

  * Mono uses just-in-time (JIT) compilation and compiles code on demand at runtime.
  * IL2CPP uses ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation and compiles your entire application before it runs.

This section contains further information about these back ends:

**Topic** | **Description**

[IL2CPP overview](scripting-backends-il2cpp.html) | Information about the IL2CPP scripting back end.  
[Scripting restrictions](scripting-restrictions.html) | This section contains information on what scripting restrictions apply to each platform you want to build your application for, to support cross-platform code.
