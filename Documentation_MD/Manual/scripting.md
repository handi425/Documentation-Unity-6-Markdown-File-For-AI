# Scripting

Scripting in Unity refers to authoring your project’s functionality in code
rather than through the Unity Editor **UI**(User Interface) Allows a user to
interact with your application. Unity currently supports three UI systems.
[More info](UI-system-compare.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#UI). This allows you to go beyond what can be
done in the Editor UI alone. Interacting directly with the public Unity APIs
allows for finer control and a greater degree of customization.

Learning to program in particular languages is beyond the scope of this
section. However, there are many books, tutorials, and other resources for
learning how to program with Unity. Refer to [learn](http://unity3d.com/learn)
for further details.
