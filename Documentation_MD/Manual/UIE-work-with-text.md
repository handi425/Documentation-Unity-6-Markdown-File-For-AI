Get started with text

# Work with text

Text objects are defined by the following attributes of a **UI**(User
Interface) Allows a user to interact with your application. Unity currently
supports three UI systems. [More info](UI-system-compare.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#UI) control:

  * The `text` attribute of some UI controls, such as [Label](UIE-uxml-element-Label.html) or [TextElement](UIE-uxml-element-TextElement.html), that sets the display text.
  * The `value` attribute of the [TextField](UIE-uxml-element-TextField.html) that accepts the input text, and the `label` attribute that sets the display text for [TextField](UIE-uxml-element-TextField.html).

You can use [USS](UIE-USS.html) [text properties](UIE-USS-
SupportedProperties.html#unity-text) to style text, such as set the font size
and color, etc.

You can also add a new font to style text. Convert fonts to font assets before
you use them in your project. In addition to USS styling, you can use rich
text tags to style certain words in a text string.
