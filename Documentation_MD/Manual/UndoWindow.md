# Undo

The **Undo History** window provides a visual way of navigating through your
undo history, or undoing or redoing multiple actions in the Editor at once.

## Undoing and redoing actions

To open the **Undo History** window, click the Undo icon
(![](../uploads/Main/undo-icon.png)), or choose **Edit** > **Undo History**.

Select an entry in the **Undo History** window to revert your project back to
that point automatically.

Once you have selected an action, redoable actions are indicated with a red
line. Click any of the actions to add them back.

**More Options** (**:**) menu in the **Undo History** window and choose to
