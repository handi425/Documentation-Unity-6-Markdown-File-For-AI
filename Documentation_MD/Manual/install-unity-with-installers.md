# Install Unity using installer files

The installer files are executable programs provided as `.pkg` files on macOS
and `.exe` files on Windows, that you can use to install the Unity Editor and
other components. The components provide target platform build support for the
installed Unity Editor version. You must download separate installer files for
Unity Editor and other components.

Follow these steps to install the Unity Editor and other components using the
installer files:

  1. Access the [Unity download archive](https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive) website to select the release versions of the Unity Editor.  
**Note** : To get early access to features in the upcoming release, check
[Unity Beta Program](https://unity.com/releases/editor/beta).

  2. Use the filter controls to list the versions of Unity you’re interested in. 

  3. In the **Downloads** column, select **See all** for the version of Unity you want to install.  
This opens a new page that displays the **Manual installs** and **Component
installers** sections for the selected Unity Editor version.

  4. In the **Manual installs** > **Operating Systems** section, select the Unity Editor installer file for the operating system of your development computer. **Note** : To download and install other components, such as platform build support, go to the **Component installers** section, expand the relevant operating system section and select the required component.

The download process of the installer file starts. If prompted, save the file,
and note the download location.

  5. Use your file manager application to go to the location where you downloaded the installer file.

**Note** : You can use the downloaded installer file to install Unity Editor
on other computers using the command line.

  6. Run the installer file and follow the **Introduction** and **License** prompts.

  7. Choose the folder location where you want to install the Unity Editor. You can change the default location. Note the selected location.

**Note** : When installing components, select the root folder of Unity Editor
installation you want to add the components to.

  8. Proceed through the remaining steps to complete the installation process. When the process completes, the installer deploys the Unity Editor to the following default locations:

     * On macOS, `Applications/Unity`.
     * On Windows, `C:\Program Files\Unity <version>`.

**Note** : Some platforms might require you to install additional dependencies
alongside the platform build support component. Refer to [Platforms
development](PlatformSpecific.html) to understand the dependency requirement
of the supported platforms.
