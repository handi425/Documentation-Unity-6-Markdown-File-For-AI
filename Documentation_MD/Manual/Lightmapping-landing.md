Baking lightmaps before runtime

# Precalculating surface lighting with lightmaps

Resources for improving performance by setting up Unity to do complicated
lighting calculations ahead of time, either by baking **lightmaps** A pre-
rendered texture that contains the effects of light sources on static objects
in the scene. Lightmaps are overlaid on top of scene geometry to create the
effect of lighting. [More info](Lightmapping.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Lightmap) into a build or creating lightmaps
at runtime.

**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Baking lightmaps before runtime](Lightmapping-baking-before-runtime.html) | Resources for precalculating the lit colors of **GameObjects** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject) and storing them in textures
called lightmaps.  
[Creating lightmaps at runtime with Enlighten Realtime Global Illumination](realtime-gi-using-enlighten-landing.html) | Resources for using **Enlighten** A lighting system by Geomerics used in Unity for Enlighten Realtime Global Illumination. [More info](https://www.siliconstudio.co.jp/en/products-service/enlighten/)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Enlighten) to precalculate visibility
information, which Unity uses to create and update lightmaps at runtime.  
[Configuring lightmapping](configure-lightmapping-settings.html) | Resources for choosing between baked and real-time lightmapping, and changing how GameObjects contribute to lightmaps.
