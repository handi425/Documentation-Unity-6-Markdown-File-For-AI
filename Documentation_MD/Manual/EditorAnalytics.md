# Editor analytics

The Unity Editor collects data about how the product gets used. Unity uses
this data to make informed decisions on how to improve features in the Editor.
Unity uses its own custom software to collect these **analytics** Abbreviation
of **Unity Analytics**  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Analytics).

## Examples of analytics

The following are examples of some of the analytics that Unity collects:

  * **Menu item use** : Unity tracks how often some menu items are used. If menu items are rarely used or not used at all, Unity might use this data to determine if the menus might be simplified or if some menu items could be hidden.
  * **Build times** : Unity collects data about how long builds take to compile. Unity might use this data to focus on optimizing the correct code.
  * **Platform support** : By collecting data on which target platforms games are being built for, Unity can effectively prioritise support for the most important platforms.
