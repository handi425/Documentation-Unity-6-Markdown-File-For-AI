# Text-Based Scene Files

As well as the default binary format, Unity also provides a text-based format
for **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think
of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your
environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building
your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene) data. This can be useful when working
with **version control** A system for managing file changes. You can use Unity
in conjunction with most common version control tools, including Perforce,
Git, Mercurial and PlasticSCM. [More info](VersionControl.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#VersionControl) software, since text files
generated separately can be merged more easily than binary files. Also, the
text data can be generated and parsed by tools, making it possible to create
and analyze scenes automatically. The pages in this section provide some
reference material for working with the format.

See the [Editor](class-EditorManager.html) window page for how to enable this
feature.
