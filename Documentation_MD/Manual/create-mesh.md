# Create a mesh

You can add meshes to a Unity project in the following ways:

  * Create a **mesh** The main graphics primitive of Unity. Meshes make up a large part of your 3D worlds. Unity supports triangulated or Quadrangulated polygon meshes. Nurbs, Nurms, Subdiv surfaces must be converted to polygons. [More info](mesh.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Mesh) as part of a [model](models.html)A 3D
model representation of an object, such as a character, a building, or a piece
of furniture. [More info](3D-formats.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Model) in a 3D modeling program, then import
it. Unity creates a mesh asset as a part of the model hierarchy when you
import a model. For more information, see [Importing
Models](ImportingModelFiles.html).

  * Create a mesh directly with in-Editor tools. Unity has built-in primitive shapes such as spheres and capsules that you can place directly into a **Scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene). You can also use a package like
[ProBuilder](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.probuilder@latest) to
model a custom mesh in the Editor.

  * [Create meshes with code](creating-meshes.html), either at runtime or in the Editor.
