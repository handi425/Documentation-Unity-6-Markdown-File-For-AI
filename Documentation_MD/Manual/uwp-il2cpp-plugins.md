Use managed UWP plug-ins

# Use UWP plug-ins with IL2CPP

You can use plug-ins to call code created outside of Unity from your C#
**scripts** A piece of code that allows you to create your own Components,
trigger game events, modify Component properties over time and respond to user
input in any way you like. [More info](creating-scripts.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scripts). The plug-in model for Universal
Windows Platform (UWP) is similar to other Unity-supported platforms. For more
information about plug-ins with Unity, refer to [Plug-ins](./plug-ins.html)A
set of code created outside of Unity that creates functionality in Unity.
There are two kinds of plug-ins you can use in Unity: Managed plug-ins
(managed .NET assemblies created with tools like Visual Studio) and Native
plug-ins (platform-specific native code libraries). [More info](./plug-
ins.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Plug-in).
