# Particle physics

Resources for configuring simulated physics and **collisions** A collision
occurs when the physics engine detects that the colliders of two GameObjects
make contact or overlap, when at least one has a Rigidbody component and is in
motion. [More info](CollidersOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Collision) on particles.

**Topic** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Particle physics forces](particle-physics-forces.html) | Understand how the **Particle System** A component that simulates fluid entities such as liquids, clouds and flames by generating and animating large numbers of small 2D images in the scene. [More info](class-ParticleSystem.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#particlesystem) can simulate physics forces
that act on a particle.  
[Apply forces to particles](apply-forces-particles.html) | Use the Particle System Force Field to set up forces on the particles in a Particle System.  
[Particle collisions](particle-collisions.html) | Understand how the Particle System can create and calculate collisions between particles and **GameObjects** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject)  
[Particle triggers](particle-triggers.html) | Understand how the Particle System can use particle **colliders** An invisible shape that is used to handle physical collisions for an object. A collider doesn’t need to be exactly the same shape as the object’s mesh - a rough approximation is often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay. [More info](CollidersOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Collider) to act as triggers.  
[Configure a particle trigger](configure-particle-trigger.html) | Create and configure a trigger on the particles of a Particle System.  
[Particle System Force Field component reference](class-ParticleSystemForceField.html) | Explore the properties on the Particle System Force Field component, to apply forces to particles.
