SpeedTree model import

# Import trees from SpeedTree

[SpeedTree](https://store.speedtree.com/) provides prebuilt tree assets and
modeling software focused specifically on trees. SpeedTree supports all
**render pipelines** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene,
and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render
pipelines, or write your own. [More info](render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Renderpipeline).
