# Linux

Unity provides support for developing applications on Linux. You can build
your application as a standalone executable and run it on Linux systems that
support the same architecture that Unity supports. You can also build your
application as a library and use it as a **plug-in** A set of code created
outside of Unity that creates functionality in Unity. There are two kinds of
plug-ins you can use in Unity: Managed plug-ins (managed .NET assemblies
created with tools like Visual Studio) and Native plug-ins (platform-specific
native code libraries). [More info](./plug-ins.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Plug-in) in other applications.
