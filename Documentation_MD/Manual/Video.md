# Video and cutscenes

Use Unity’s video system to integrate video into your application. Video
footage can add realism to your game, reduce rendering complexity, or help you
integrate content available externally. Unity’s video features include the
[Hardware-accelerated and software-based decoding](VideoSources-
VideoFiles.html) of video sources, [Transparency
support](VideoTransparency.html), multiple [Audio sources](class-
AudioSource.html)A component which plays back an Audio Clip in the scene to an
audio listener or through an audio mixer. [More info](class-AudioSource.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#AudioSource), and [Network
streaming](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.renderstreaming@3.1/manual/video-
streaming.html).

To use video in Unity, [Import your video sources](video-sources-import) and
configure them using the [Video Player component](class-VideoPlayer.html).

**Note:** If you don’t want to use externally pre-rendered video, use the
[Timeline
package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.timeline@latest?/manual/index.html)
to create cutscenes and cinematic sequences in Unity.
