System requirements for Unity 6

# Install Unity

The [Hub](https://docs.unity3d.com/hub/manual/index.html) is the primary way
to install the Unity Editor, create projects, and manage your Unity
experience. It provides a central location to manage your Editor
installations, accounts, licenses, and projects. For information on installing
Unity using Hub, refer to [Install and uninstall Editor
versions](https://docs.unity3d.com/hub/manual/AddEditor.html).

Apart from using the Hub, you can install the Unity Editor by using the
installer files or Unity Download Assistant. During installation, the Download
Assistant generates a script and installer files that you can use to install
Unity on other computers (including offline computers) using the command line.
If you choose to install the Hub later, you can add the previously installed
Editor versions to the Hub.
