# Update an asset package

You can update an asset package that you got from the **Asset Store** A
growing library of free and commercial assets created by Unity and members of
the community. Offers a wide variety of assets, from textures, models and
animations to whole project examples, tutorials and Editor extensions. [More
info](AssetStore.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#AssetStore) by using the **Package Manager**
window.

**Note:** Follow this task to update an asset package from the Asset Store
that’s already in your project. Refer to the following resources for other
related tasks:

  * For information about importing an asset package from the Asset Store that isn’t in your project yet, refer to [Download and import an asset package](upm-ui-import.html).
  * For information about updating **UPM packages** A **Package** managed by the **Unity Package Manager**. Refer to **Packages**.  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#UPMpackage) that came from the Asset Store,
refer to [Switch to another version of a UPM package](upm-ui-update.html).

  * For information about the different package types, refer to [Package types](upm-package-types.html).

To update an asset package:

  1. Open the **Package Manager** window and select **My Assets** from the [navigation panel](upm-ui-nav.html).

![Select the My Assets context](../uploads/Main/upm-ui-myassets.png) Select
the **My Assets** context

An upward-pointing arrow indicator (![](../uploads/Main/iconUpdate.png))
appears next to any packages that have updates available.

  2. Optional: To view your list with the most recently updated Asset Store packages first, [sort the list](upm-ui-sort.html) by **Recently updated**.

![Choose Recently updated from the Sort menu](../uploads/Main/upm-ui-
update2-sort.png) Choose **Recently updated** from the **Sort** menu

  3. Select the Asset Store package you want to update from the [list of packages](upm-ui-list.html). The package information appears in the [details panel](upm-ui-details.html).

  4. Optional: Select the **Releases** tab to review the changes in the latest versions of the package.

![Changelog information in the Releases tab](../uploads/Main/upm-ui-update-
rel.png) Changelog information in the **Releases** tab

  5. Select the **Download update #.#** button. **Note** : 

     * If the download button appears as **Download update #.#*** , the asterisk (*) means that you have an older version of that package with the same version number in your package cache. The publisher has subsequently published an updated version of the package without changing its version number. Click that download button to get the latest version of the package. 

     * If the downloaded version of your package isn’t compatible with your version of the Unity Editor, a message appears in the details panel and an alternate **Update** button displays, which lets you download a compatible version of the package.

![Update button for incompatible versions](../uploads/Main/upm-ui-update-
alt.png) **Update** button for incompatible versions

  6. To update your project with the package you downloaded in the previous step, select **Import update #.# to project**. 

You can update multiple Asset Store packages with one click by using the
multiple select feature. For more information, refer to [Perform an action on
multiple packages or feature sets](upm-ui-multi.html).
