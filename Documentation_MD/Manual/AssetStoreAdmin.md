# Asset Store Publisher portal

The [Asset Store
Publisher](https://publisher.assetstore.unity3d.com/info.html) portal lets you
manage your profile as an **Asset Store** A growing library of free and
commercial assets created by Unity and members of the community. Offers a wide
variety of assets, from textures, models and animations to whole project
examples, tutorials and Editor extensions. [More info](AssetStore.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#AssetStore) provider.

![The Asset Store Publisher portal lets you manage your packages and
accounts](../uploads/Main/AssetStoreAdmin.png) The Asset Store Publisher
portal lets you manage your packages and accounts

The Asset Store Publisher portal displays your account information across
several tabs:

  * PackagesPackages are collections of assets to be shared and re-used in Unity. The [Unity Package Manager](upm-ui.html) (UPM) can display, add, and remove packages from your project. These packages are native to the Unity Package Manager and provide a fundamental method of delivering Unity functionality. However, the Unity Package Manager can also display [Asset Store packages](AssetStorePackages.html) that you downloaded from the Asset Store. [More info](Packages.html)

## Packages

Use the **Packages** tab to manage your Asset Store packages and create new
packages for submission. The contents of this tab change depending on the
status you select from the Package Status drop-down menu.

![The Package Status drop-down menu is to the right of the Create New Package
button](../uploads/Main/AssetStorePackagesInDraft.png) The Package Status
drop-down menu is to the right of the Create New Package button

Refer to [Filling in the package details](AssetStorePkgDetails.html) for
workflows and procedures relating to publishing packages.

### Package status

A package can go through many states during its lifecycle. For a list of all
package in a state, do the following:

  1. Open the [Asset Store Publisher](https://publisher.assetstore.unity3d.com/) portal.
  2. Navigate to the **Packages** tab.
  3. Choose a status from the Package Status drop-down menu.

**Status:** | **Description:**  
---|---  
**Draft** | This is a version of your package before you submit it to the Asset Store. A draft represents the information on the **Create new package** page, but it can also include the Assets from your Project.  
**Pending** | This is a package that the Asset Store Specialists have received for review. Contact [the Asset Store team](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/mailto:assetstore@unity3d.com.html) if your package is still pending for more than one month after you submit it.  
**Published** | This is a package published on the Asset Store and available for users to buy and download.  
**Declined** | If the Asset Store Specialists reviews your package and decides not to publish it, it’s marked as Declined. You can make any improvements suggested by the Asset Store Specialists, and then create a new draft to resubmit.  
**Disabled** | When the Asset Store disables a package, that means it’s not available to publishers or users (even those who have already purchased it). Most of the time this happens because a publisher [submits a takedown notice](http://response.unity3d.com/takedown-notice?_ga=2.175653543.486288397.1585517171-1395087459.1585343727) of copyright violation ([DMCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act)) or trademark conflicts.  
**Deprecated** | When the Asset Store deprecates a package, that means it’s no longer discoverable by customers who haven’t downloaded or purchased it. Customers who have already downloaded or purchased the package can still access it from their Unity account.  
  
You can mark a package as deprecated from the Asset Store so that it’s no
longer available (except to customers who have already purchased or downloaded
it). For more information, refer to [Deprecating your
Assets](AssetStoreRemoving.html).  
  
## Reviews

The **Reviews** tab displays feedback from users on your packages.

![The Publisher Reviews tab displays reviews for your
packages](../uploads/Main/AssetStoreAdmin-reviews.png) The Publisher Reviews
tab displays reviews for your packages

If you respond to user reviews, make sure your responses are professional. If
you encounter any abusive language (either figurative or literal), or if the
review has nothing to do with the Asset itself, click the **Report this
review** button to tell the Asset Store team. For more information, refer to
[the Publisher’s forum](https://forum.unity.com/forums/asset-store-
publishers.91/).

Reviews are available via an RSS feed (refer to the link at the bottom). You
can set up a service that can deliver RSS directly to your email account using
a third-party provider such as [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) or
[Zapier](https://zapier.com/).

## Upgrades

When you are ready to publish a new version of your package, you can manage
that on the **Upgrades** tab.

For more information, refer to [Upgrading packages](AssetStoreUpgrade.html).

## Sales

The **Sales** tab displays the sales data on each of your paid packages (one
row for each package). It also displays the Gross and Net amounts for the
selected month. You can view the sales figures for different months by
changing the month from the drop down box.

![The Sales tab shows statistics about paid package
purchases](../uploads/Main/AssetStoreAdmin-sales.png) The Sales tab shows
statistics about paid package purchases

This tab only displays paid packages.

**Column:** | **Description:**  
---|---  
**Package** | The name of the package, linked directly to your package page on the Asset Store.  
**Price** | The cost of the product at the time of the sale.  
**Qty** | The quantity of purchases for that package.  
**Refunds** | The number of refunds completed for that package.  
**Chargebacks** | The number of chargeback refunds completed for that package. A chargeback is when a credit-card provider demands that a retailer compensate them for the loss on a fraudulent or disputed transaction.  
**Gross** | The gross amount of money earned for that package’s sales.  
**First** | The date of the first purchase for that package for the selected month.  
**Last** | The date of the last purchase for that package for the selected month.  
  
## Downloads

The **Downloads** tab displays the number of times a user has downloaded a
specific Asset. This includes only paid Assets. This number might not match
the Asset’s sales in any particular month because users might not download the
data right away and can download the data multiple times over the lifetime of
use.

![The Downloads tab displays statistics about your free package
downloads](../uploads/Main/AssetStoreAdmin-downloads.png) The Downloads tab
displays statistics about your free package downloads

This tab only displays free packages. Paid packages appear on the Sales tab.

**Downloads** | The number of downloads on that package.  
**First** | The date of the first download for that package for the selected month.  
**Last** | The date of the last download for that package for the selected month.  
  
## Revenue

The **Revenue** tab displays your revenue earned for each month and when Unity
paid your earnings.

## Verify Invoice

The **Verify Invoice** tab lets you enter the invoice number of an Asset Store
customer to refer to if the invoice is valid. It also displays any packages
already refunded for that invoice.

For more information about refunding customers, refer to [Refunding your
customers](AssetStoreRefunding.html).

## Vouchers

The **Vouchers** tab lets you generate a voucher code which you can give to a
customer. Customers can use vouchers to download a paid package for free. This
tab also displays any vouchers you have already issued.

For more about how to create a voucher for a paid package, refer to [Issuing
vouchers](AssetStoreVouchers.html).

## Users

You can manage members of your publishing team on the **Users** tab.

The **Payout** tab provides access to your Unity ID page where you can manage
payout options for the revenue earned by your Publisher Account.

For more information about setting up your payout profile and tax information,
refer to [Collecting revenue](AssetStorePayouts.html).

The **Info** tab lets you edit the profile of your Publisher Account. This tab
appears when you first [create your Publisher
Account](AssetStoreCreateAcct.html), but you can come back at any time to
update the information.
