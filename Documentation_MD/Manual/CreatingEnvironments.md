# World building

Unity provides a selection of tools that let you create environmental features
such as landforms and vegetation.

In this section, you can find information on:

**Topic** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Sky](sky.html) | Use skyboxes in your project.  
[Terrain](script-Terrain.html)The landscape in your scene. A Terrain
GameObject adds a large flat plane to your scene and you can use the Terrain’s
Inspector window to create a detailed landscape. [More info](terrain-
UsingTerrains.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Terrain) | Information on Unity’s built-in Terrain features. These consist of tools that let you create and modify landscapes in the Unity Editor, and runtime features that optimize Terrain rendering.  
[Terrain Tools](TerrainTools.html) | Information on the Terrain Tools package, which provides additional Editor tooling functionality on top of the built-in Terrain features.
