Texture and mesh loading

# Loading texture and mesh data asynchronously

Strategies and resources for uploading texture and **mesh** The main graphics
primitive of Unity. Meshes make up a large part of your 3D worlds. Unity
supports triangulated or Quadrangulated polygon meshes. Nurbs, Nurms, Subdiv
surfaces must be converted to polygons. [More info](mesh.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Mesh) data to the GPU asynchronously, to
improve performance.

**Topic** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Uploading texture and mesh data to the GPU](LoadingTextureandMeshData.html) | Understand the difference between the synchronous and asynchronous upload pipelines, and what makes a mesh eligible for asynchronous upload.  
[Check whether a mesh uses the asynchronous upload pipeline](identify-mesh-upload-pipeline.html) | Identify whether Unity is using the synchronous or asynchronous upload pipeline for a specific mesh.  
[Configure the asynchronous upload pipeline](configure-asynchronous-upload-pipeline.html) | Configure the streaming buffer and upload time Unity allocates for asynchronously uploading mesh data to the GPU.
