# Search Project Assets

Use the Asset Search Provider to search all Assets in the current Project. You
can search using keywords or GUIDs (Instance IDs).

You can also search the Asset Database or the file system from the Search
window.

## Asset Search Provider vs. Asset Database search

Search uses its own Asset indexer, which is faster and more flexible than the
Asset Database or the Project Browser.

For example:

  * You can type a file extension and it will find all Assets with that extension.
  * It matches against directory name
  * It does a partial search

## Search the file system

If you use the asterisk (*****) in a query, Search performs both a normal
search and a wildcard search against the file systems. This allows you to
include files not indexed by the Asset database in your searches.
