HDR

# HDR in the Built-in Render Pipeline

Support for **HDR** high dynamic range  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#HDR) in the Built-In **Render Pipeline** A
series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a
screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your
own. [More info](render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) depends on the **rendering
path** The technique that a render pipeline uses to render graphics. Choosing
a different rendering path affects how lighting and shading are calculated.
Some rendering paths are more suited to different platforms and hardware than
others. [More info](RenderingPaths.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#RenderingPath) in use.

## Forward Rendering

In the **Forward rendering** A rendering path that renders each object in one
or more passes, depending on lights that affect the object. Lights themselves
are also treated differently by Forward Rendering, depending on their settings
and intensity. [More info](RenderTech-ForwardRendering.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#ForwardRendering) path, a **Camera** A
component which creates an image of a particular viewpoint in your scene. The
output is either drawn to the screen or captured as a texture. [More
info](CamerasOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Camera) only supports HDR if you have a
**post-processing** A process that improves product visuals by applying
filters and effects before the image appears on screen. You can use post-
processing effects to simulate physical camera and film properties, for
example Bloom and Depth of Field. [More info](PostProcessingOverview.html)
post processing, postprocessing, postprocess  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#post-processing) effect on the Camera. This is
due to performance considerations. If you have no post-processing effect on
the Camera, the **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your
game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you
place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and
building your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene) will be rendered directly to the back
buffer where HDR is not supported.

## Deferred Shading

In the **Deferred Shading** A rendering path in the Built-in Render Pipeline
that places no limit on the number of Lights that can affect a GameObject. All
Lights are evaluated per-pixel, which means that they all interact correctly
with normal maps and so on. Additionally, all Lights can have cookies and
shadows. [More info](RenderTech-DeferredShading.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Deferredshading) rendering path, when HDR is
enabled for a Camera the lighting buffer is also allocated as a floating point
buffer. This reduces banding in the lighting buffer.
