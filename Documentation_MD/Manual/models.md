# Models

Models are files that contain data about the shape and appearance of **3D
objects** A 3D GameObject such as a cube, terrain or ragdoll. [More
info](GameObjects.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#3DObject), such as characters, **terrain** The
landscape in your scene. A Terrain GameObject adds a large flat plane to your
scene and you can use the Terrain’s Inspector window to create a detailed
landscape. [More info](terrain-UsingTerrains.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Terrain), or environment objects.

Model files can contain a variety of data, including [meshes](mesh.html),
[materials](Materials.html)An asset that defines how a surface should be
rendered. [More info](class-Material.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Material), and [textures](Textures.html)An
image used when rendering a GameObject, Sprite, or UI element. Textures are
often applied to the surface of a mesh to give it visual detail. [More
info](class-TextureImporter.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#texture). They can also contain animation
data, for animated characters.

You usually create models in an external application, and then import them
into Unity.
