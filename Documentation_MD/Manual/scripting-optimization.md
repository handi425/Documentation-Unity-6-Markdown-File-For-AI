Asynchronous programming with the Awaitable class

# Code optimization

Considering performance in all the code you write helps your project scale
without bottlenecks. There are several ways you can improve performance,
including avoiding bad practices, [profiling](Profiler.html) your code,
implementing appropriate design patterns, and using techniques like
asynchronous programming to split work across multiple threads of execution.

**Topic** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Asynchronous programming](./async-await-support.html) | Asynchronous programming in Unity with the .NET `async` and `await` keywords and Unity’s own custom `Awaitable` class.  
[Job system](./job-system.html) | Use Unity’s own `Job` system to get the most out of multi-core CPUs and parallelize your algorithms.
