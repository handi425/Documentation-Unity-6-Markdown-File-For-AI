# Automated testing

Tests are an important part of modern software development practice. Writing
tests for your code helps you have confidence that your project works as
expected as it scales in size and complexity. Unity provides the [Unity Test
Framework](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.test-framework@latest)
package to help you write and run tests for your C# code.

The package integrates and extends the C# test framework NUnit, adding custom
Unity functionality is a tool that allows you to test your code in both
**Edit** mode and **Play** mode, and also on target platforms such as
Standalone, Android, or iOS. The **Test Runner** The Test Framework package
(formerly called the Test Runner) is a Unity tool that tests your code in both
Edit mode and Play mode, and also on target platforms such as Standalone,
Android, or iOS. [More info](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.test-
framework@latest)
