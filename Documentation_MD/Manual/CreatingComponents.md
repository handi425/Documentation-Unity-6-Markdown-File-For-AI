# Create components with scripts

Components add functionality to a **GameObject** The fundamental object in
Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras,
waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components
attached to it. [More info](class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject). To customize and add to the
components in the Editor, you can write your own **scripts** A piece of code
that allows you to create your own Components, trigger game events, modify
Component properties over time and respond to user input in any way you like.
[More info](creating-scripts.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scripts).

To create a component with script, you need to write the script and then
attach it to a GameObject. Scripts attached to a GameObject appear in the
GameObject’s **Inspector** A Unity window that displays information about the
currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to
inspect and edit the values. [More info](UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Inspector) window because the Editor treats
them as built-in components.

For information on how to create a script, see [Creating and Using
Scripts](creating-scripts.html).

## Additional Resources

  * The [Component](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Component.html)A functional part of a GameObject. A GameObject can contain any number of components. Unity has many built-in components, and you can create your own by writing scripts that inherit from MonoBehaviour. [More info](UsingComponents.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#component) Scripting API page.
