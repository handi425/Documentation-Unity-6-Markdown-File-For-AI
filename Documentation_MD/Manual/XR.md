Overview

# XR

XR is an umbrella term that includes the following types of applications:

  * **Virtual Reality** Virtual Reality (VR) immerses users in an artificial 3D world of realistic images and sounds, using a headset and motion tracking. [More info](VROverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#VirtualReality) (VR): The application
simulates a self-contained environment around the user.

  * **Mixed Reality** Mixed Reality (MR) combines its own virtual environment with the user’s real-world environment and allows them to interact with each other.  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#MixedReality) (MR): The application combines
its own environment with the user’s real-world environment and allows them to
interact with each other.

  * **Augmented Reality** Augmented Reality (AR) uses computer graphics or video composited on top of a live video feed to augment the view and create interaction with real and virtual objects. [More info](AROverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#AugmentedReality) (AR): The application layers
content over a view of the real world.

The span between virtual to augmented reality is a continuum, with mixed
reality falling somewhere in the middle, depending on the capabilities of a
particular device and the intent of your application.

[Set up an XR scene](xr-scene-setup.html) | How to add the **GameObjects** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject) and components needed by an XR
**scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of
each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your
environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building
your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)
