Introduction to instantiating prefabs

# Instantiating prefabs at runtime

[Prefabs](Prefabs.html)An asset type that allows you to store a GameObject
complete with components and properties. The prefab acts as a template from
which you can create new object instances in the scene. [More
info](Prefabs.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Prefab) are useful when you want to
instantiate complicated **GameObjects** The fundamental object in Unity
scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints,
and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached
to it. [More info](class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject) or collections of GameObjects at
runtime. Compared with creating GameObjects from scratch using code,
instantiating prefabs using code has many advantages because you can:

  * Instantiate a prefab using one line of code. Creating equivalent GameObjects from scratch requires many more lines of code.

  * Set up, test, and modify the prefab quickly and easily using the ****Scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene) view**, **Hierarchy** , and
****Inspector** A Unity window that displays information about the currently
selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and
edit the values. [More info](UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Inspector)** windows.

  * Change which prefab is instantiated without changing the code. You can make a simple rocket into a super-charged rocket, without any code changes.
