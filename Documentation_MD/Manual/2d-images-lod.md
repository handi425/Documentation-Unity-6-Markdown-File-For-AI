Techniques and resources for using 2D **billboards** A textured 2D object that
rotates so that it always faces the Camera. [More info](class-
BillboardRenderer.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Billboard) to simplify 3D meshes that are far
away.

**Topic:** | **Description:**  
---|---  
[Applying 2D billboards for low LOD meshes](applying-2d-billboards-low-lod-meshes.html) | Understand how Unity uses Billboard Renderers and Billboard assets to create a 2D billboard for low-LOD rendering.  
[Billboard Renderer component reference](class-BillboardRenderer.html) | Explore the properties in the Billboard Renderer to to customize how Unity renders billboards and their interaction with lighting.

How you work with billboards depends on the **render pipeline** A series of
operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen.
Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own.
[More info](render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) you use.
