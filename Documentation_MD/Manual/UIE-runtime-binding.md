# Runtime data binding

Runtime data binding binds the properties of any plain C# `object` to the
properties of a **UI**(User Interface) Allows a user to interact with your
application. Unity currently supports three UI systems. [More info](UI-system-
compare.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#UI) control. You can use this type of data
binding in both the runtime and Editor UI. However, for serialized data in the
Editor UI, use the [SerializedObject data binding](UIE-editor-binding.html)
because it provides better support for Unity’s [serialization system](script-
serialization.html), including undo/redo functionality and multi-selection
operations.
