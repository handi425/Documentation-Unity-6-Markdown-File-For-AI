# Version Control

You can use Unity in conjunction with most common **version control** tools,
including Perforce and PlasticSCM. This section gives details of the tools and
options available and how to work with them.

**Topic** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Version control integration](Versioncontrolintegration.html) | Integrate Unity with version control systems.  
[PerForce](perForceIntegration.html)A version control system for file change
management. [More info](perForceIntegration.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Perforce) | Use the Perforce version control system.  
[SmartMerge](SmartMerge.html) | Use the **UnityYAMLMerge** tool to merge **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene) and **prefab** An asset type that
allows you to store a GameObject complete with components and properties. The
prefab acts as a template from which you can create new object instances in
the scene. [More info](Prefabs.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Prefab) files in a semantically correct way.
