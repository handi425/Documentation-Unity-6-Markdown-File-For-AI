# Materials and shaders

The following topics give an overview on how to use textures, shaders,
materials, and graphics APIs in Unity.

**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Textures](Textures-landing.html)An image used when rendering a GameObject,
Sprite, or UI element. Textures are often applied to the surface of a mesh to
give it visual detail. [More info](class-TextureImporter.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#texture) | Resources for importing, converting and loading textures so that you can them in shaders and materials.  
[Shaders](Shaders.html)A program that runs on the GPU. [More
info](Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Shader) | Resources for using or writing programs that run on the GPU to control the appearance of objects in a **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene).  
[Materials](Materials.html)An asset that defines how a surface should be
rendered. [More info](class-Material.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Material) | Resources for using materials to define the appearance of your scene.
