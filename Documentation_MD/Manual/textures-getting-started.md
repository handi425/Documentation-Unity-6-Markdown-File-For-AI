Introduction to textures

# Get started with textures

Learn about texture types, GPU **texture formats** A file format for handling
textures during real-time rendering by 3D graphics hardware, such as a
graphics card or mobile device. [More info](class-TextureImporterOverride)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#TextureFormat), and mipmaps.

**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Introduction to textures](Textures.html) | Learn about how textures provide the fine detail of a surface, and how different features use textures.  
[Texture types](texture-types.html) | Learn about albedo textures, alpha maps, **normal maps** A type of Bump Map texture that allows you to add surface detail such as bumps, grooves, and scratches to a model which catch the light as if they are represented by real geometry.  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Normalmap), detail maps, and **terrain** The
landscape in your scene. A Terrain GameObject adds a large flat plane to your
scene and you can use the Terrain’s Inspector window to create a detailed
landscape. [More info](terrain-UsingTerrains.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Terrain) **heightmaps** A greyscale Texture
that stores height data for an object. Each pixel stores the height difference
perpendicular to the face that pixel represents.  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Heightmap).  
[Texture formats in memory](texture-compression-formats.html) | Resources for choosing and using texture **compression** A method of storing data that reduces the amount of storage space it requires. See [Texture Compression](class-TextureImporterOverride), [Animation Compression](class-AnimationClip.html#AssetProperties), [Audio Compression](class-AudioClip.html), [Build Compression](ReducingFilesize.html).  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#compression) formats on the GPU.  
[Mipmaps](texture-mipmaps-introduction.html) | Understand how mipmaps store progressively smaller and lower resolution versions of a single texture.
