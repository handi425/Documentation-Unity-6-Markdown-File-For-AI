Creating your Publisher Account

# Publish to the Asset Store

This is the workflow to publish your assets to the **Asset Store** A growing
library of free and commercial assets created by Unity and members of the
community. Offers a wide variety of assets, from textures, models and
animations to whole project examples, tutorials and Editor extensions. [More
info](AssetStore.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#AssetStore):

  1. [Create your Publisher Account](AssetStoreCreateAcct.html).
  2. [Create a new package draft](AssetStoreCreatePkg.html). You can also [delete your draft](AssetStoreDeletePkg.html) at any time and create a new draft.
  3. [Upload the assets into the package](AssetStoreUpload.html).
  4. [Finalize the package details](AssetStorePkgDetails.html).
  5. [Submit the package for approval](AssetStoreSubmit.html).
  6. [View the status of your Asset Store submissions](AssetStoreStatus.html).

While you wait to hear whether Unity has accepted your package to the Asset
Store, you can [set up your payout profile](AssetStorePayouts.html), so you
can collect revenue from your packages. If you haven’t already done this, you
can also [set up customer support for your publisher
account](AssetStoreSupport.html).

After your package is on the Asset Store, you can take these actions to
improve discoverability and encourage customers to buy your package:

  * [Add tags to your package](AssetStoreMassLabeler.html) to make it easier for your customers to find it.
  * [Connecting your account to Google Analytics](AssetStoreAnalytics.html) to track website traffic to your package page on the Asset Store.
  * Unity might offer you the chance to include your package in an Asset Store sales promotion. You can either [participate in Unity’s sales promotion or set up one of your own](AssetStorePromotion.html).
  * Authorize Unity [to refund your customers](AssetStoreRefunding.html) for a package.

If you want to update or enhance an existing package, you can [create a major
upgrade version](AssetStoreUpgrade.html). After your upgrade is published to
the Asset Store, you can [deprecate your old package](AssetStoreRemoving.html)
so that new users only find the most recent version. You can also create a
“lite” upgrade version, so customers can test out your package without
spending the full amount.

You can use the tabs on your Publisher Account page to:

  * Read the [Reviews](AssetStoreAdmin.html#reviews) about your packages.
  * Check [Sales](AssetStoreAdmin.html#sales) and [Revenue](AssetStoreAdmin.html#revenue).
  * See the statistics on your package [Downloads](AssetStoreAdmin.html#downloads) and any [Vouchers](AssetStoreAdmin.html#vouchers) you issued to customers.
  * Manage the [Users](AssetStoreAdmin.html#users) on your team.
  * Manage your account [Info](AssetStoreAdmin.html#info).

For additional help with any of these procedures, refer to the online [Asset
Store FAQ](https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/sections/201163815-Asset-
Store-Publishers-) and the [Asset Store
forum](https://forum.unity.com/forums/assets-and-asset-store.32/). Publishers
who have an asset accepted to the Asset Store can also apply to join [the
Publisher’s forum](https://forum.unity.com/forums/asset-store-publishers.91/).

## Concepts

Here are some important concepts you need to know about publishing to the
Unity Asset Store:

**Concept:** | **Definition:**  
---|---  
**Unity ID (account)** | Your user account for use in Unity. Your Unity ID enables you to buy subscriptions, manage your Projects and collaborate with teams, and acquire tools and samples on the Asset Store.  
  
You can only access and manage your Asset Store purchases when you’re logged
in with your Unity account. If you decide to create a publisher account, you
also need your Unity account.  
**Publisher account** | This account is tied to your Unity account, but it also gives you access to creating and publishing packages, setting up payouts, viewing sales and revenues, and managing all aspects of your profile on the Asset Store.  
**Payout profiles** | Payout profiles let you specify how (and how often) Unity pays you for your Asset sales, and whether Unity needs to withhold taxes (as some tax authorities require). Payout profiles are associated with [Organizations](https://docs.unity.com/cloud/en-us/organizations). You must be the Organization’s [Owner](https://docs.unity.com/cloud/en-us/organizations/members-groups-roles) to see, create or update its payout profile. For more information, refer to [Managing your Organization](https://docs.unity.com/cloud/en-us/organizations#membersandgroups).  
**Asset Store Tools** | You need [these tools](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/asset-store-publishing-tools-115) to be able to create packages to sell on the Asset Store from inside Unity. You can get them from the Asset Store itself: they’re like any other Asset available on the store. Download the tools to your computer and import them into your Project.  
  
The **Asset Store Tools** package also includes [the Validator
tool](AssetStoreUpload.html#ValidatorTool), which you can use to check your
Asset Store package before uploading and submitting it for review. Validating
your package with this tool is part of the review process that the Asset Store
curation team performs on your Assets when you submit a package to the Asset
Store, so running it on your package can reduce the reviewing time. However,
the Validator tool can’t completely simulate the approval process and might
sometimes give false positives.  
**Package status** | Describes what part of the package lifecycle each package is at. For more information, refer to [Package status](AssetStoreAdmin.html#pkg-status).
