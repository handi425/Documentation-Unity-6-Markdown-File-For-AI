# Enable automatic snapping to grid

When you enable automatic grid snapping, the **Move** , **Rotate** , and
**Scale** transform tools snap the selected **GameObject** The fundamental
object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery,
cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the
Components attached to it. [More info](class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject) to the grid along the active
**gizmo** A graphic overlay associated with a GameObject in a Scene, and
displayed in the Scene View. Built-in scene tools such as the move tool are
Gizmos, and you can create custom Gizmos using textures or scripting. Some
Gizmos are only drawn when the GameObject is selected, while other Gizmos are
drawn by the Editor regardless of which GameObjects are selected. [More
info](GizmosMenu.html#GizmosIcons)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Gizmo) axis. If you want the GameObject to
move in smaller increments, you can modify the values it uses to [transform
incrementally](SnapIncrements.html).

To enable automatic snapping to the grid:

  1. Enable the **Move** tool in the Tools overlay.
  2. In the **Tool Settings** overlay, set the handle orientation to **Global**.
  3. Select the grid snapping icon (![](../uploads/Main/SceneGrids-Mode-icon-inline.png)) in the [Grid and Snap overlay](GridAndSnapOverlay.html). The icon is blue when automatic grid snapping is enabled.
