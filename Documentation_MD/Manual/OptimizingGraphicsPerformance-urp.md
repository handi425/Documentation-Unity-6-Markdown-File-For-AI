Reducing rendering work on the CPU in URP

# Reducing rendering work on the CPU or GPU in URP

Resources for reducing rendering work on the CPU or adjusting settings to
improve performance in the Universal **Render Pipeline** A series of
operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen.
Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own.
[More info](render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) (URP).

**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Reducing rendering work on the CPU](urp/reduce-rendering-work-on-cpu.html) | Resources for improving performance by using the GPU Resident Drawer or GPU **occlusion culling** A process that disables rendering GameObjects that are hidden (occluded) from the view of the camera. [More info](OcclusionCulling.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Occlusionculling).  
[Adjust settings to improve performance](urp/optimize-for-better-performance.html) | Adjust settings in the URP Asset or the URP Renderer to improve performance.  
[Optimize for untethered XR devices](urp/xr-untethered-device-optimization.html) | Use tile-based GPU hardware architecture more efficiently.
