# Create a panel

The panel serves as the root element where **UI**(User Interface) Allows a
user to interact with your application. Unity currently supports three UI
systems. [More info](UI-system-compare.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#UI) hierarchies attach, and renders the UI in
the **Scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think
of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your
environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building
your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene) at runtime. How you configure the Panel
Settings asset determines how the UI is rendered. It also determines how the
UI reacts to input. For example, the panel that’s visually in the front
intercepts clicks from the user before the panels that are visually in the
back.

You can configure the Panel Settings asset to do the following:

  * Control scale and resolution
  * Apply default styles
  * Display UI on Render Textures
  * Set the panel’s sort order

To create a panel:

  1. In your project, select **Assets** > **Create** > **UI Toolkit** > **Panel Settings** to create a Panel Settings asset if you don’t have it.
  2. In the **Inspector** A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. [More info](UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Inspector) window of the Panel Settings asset,
configure the [Panel Settings](UIE-Runtime-Panel-Settings.html) properties.
