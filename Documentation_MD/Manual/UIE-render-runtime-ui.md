# Configure runtime UI

To render **UI**(User Interface) Allows a user to interact with your
application. Unity currently supports three UI systems. [More info](UI-system-
compare.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#UI) and react to input from the users in the
Game view, create a Panel Settings asset and a UI Document component. The
Panel Settings asset defines a panel in the **Scene** A Scene contains the
environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a
unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and
decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More
info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene) where the UI is rendered. The UI
Document component connects the UI to the panel.
