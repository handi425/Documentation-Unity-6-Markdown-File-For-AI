# 2D Blending

The first option in the **Inspector** A Unity window that displays information
about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing
you to inspect and edit the values. [More info](UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Inspector) of a **Blend Node** A node in a
Blend Tree graph that blends animation clip nodes. [More info](class-
BlendTree.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#BlendNode) is the **Blend Type**. This drop-
down is used to select one of the different blend types that can blend
according to one or two parameters. The 2D blending types blends the child
motions according to two parameters.

The different 2D Blend Types have different uses that they are suitable for.
They differ in how the influence of each motion is calculated.

**2D Simple Directional** : Best used when your motions represent different
directions, such as “walk forward”, “walk backward”, “walk left”, and “walk
right”, or “aim up”, “aim down”, “aim left”, and “aim right”. Optionally a
single motion at position (0, 0) can be included, such as “idle” or “aim
straight”. In the Simple Directional type there should _not_ be multiple
motions in the same direction, such as “walk forward” and “run forward”.

**2D Freeform Directional** : This blend type is also used when your motions
represent different directions, however you can have multiple motions in the
same direction, for example “walk forward” and “run forward”. In the Freeform
Directional type the set of motions should always include a single motion at
position (0, 0), such as “idle”.

**2D Freeform Cartesian** : Best used when your motions do not represent
different directions. With Freeform Cartesian your X parameter and Y parameter
can represent different concepts, such as angular speed and linear speed. An
example would be motions such as “walk forward no turn”, “run forward no
turn”, “walk forward turn right”, “run forward turn right” etc.

**Direct** : This type of blend tree lets user control the weight of each node
directly. Useful for facial shapes or random idle blending.

After setting the Blend Type, the first thing you need is to select the two
[Animation Parameters](AnimationParameters.html)Used to communicate between
scripting and the Animator Controller. Some parameters can be set in scripting
and used by the controller, while other parameters are based on Custom Curves
in Animation Clips and can be sampled using the scripting API. [More
info](AnimationParameters.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#AnimationParameters) that will control this
[Blend Tree](class-BlendTree.html). In this example, the parameters are
_velocityX_ (strafing) and _velocityZ_ (forward speed).

Then you can add individual animations by clicking **\+ - > Add Motion Field**
to add an Animation Clip to the blend tree. When you’re done, it should look
something like this:

![A 2D Blend Node with five Animation
Clips.](../uploads/Main/MecanimBlendTree2D.png) A 2D Blend Node with five
Animation Clips.

The positions in 2D blending are like the thresholds in 1D blending, except
that there are two values instead of one, corresponding to each of the two
parameters. Their positions along the horizontal X axis correspond to the
first parameter, and their positions along the vertical Y axis correspond to
the second parameter. A walking forward animation might have a velocityX of 0
and a velocityZ of 1.5, so those values should be typed into the Pos X and Pos
Y number fields for the motion.

## The 2D Blending Diagram

The diagram at the top of the Inspector shows the positions of the child
motions in the 2D blend space. The motions are shown as blue dots. Motions
with no **Animation Clip** Animation data that can be used for animated
characters or simple animations. It is a simple “unit” piece of motion, such
as (one specific instance of) “Idle”, “Walk” or “Run”. [More info](class-
AnimationClip.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#AnimationClip) or Blend Tree assigned have no
influence on the blend and are shown as gray dots. You can select a motion by
clicking on its dot in the diagram. Once selected, the influence of that
motion for each point in the blending space is visualized as a blue field. The
field is strongest right under the position of the motion, where the motion
has full influence, meaning that its animation weight is 1 and the other
animations have a weight of 0. Further away the influence decreases as the
influence of other motions take over.

![The diagram at the top of the Blend Node Inspector visualizes the weights of
the child motions over the extends of the parameter
values.](../uploads/Main/MecanimBlendTree2DDiagram.png) The diagram at the top
of the Blend Node Inspector visualizes the weights of the child motions over
the extends of the parameter values.

The red dot indicates the values of the two **Parameters**. If you press
**Play** in the **Preview** at the bottom of the **Inspector** and drag the
red dot in the diagram around, you can see how the values of the parameters
are controlling the blending of the different motions. In the diagram you can
also see the influence of each motion represented as circles around each
motion. You will see that if you move the red dot on top of one of the blue
dots representing a motion, the circle for that motion gains its maximum
radius and the circles for all other motions shrink down to nothing. At
positions that are in between several motions, multiple of the nearby motions
will have an influence on the blend. If you select one of the motions in order
to see the blue influence field of that motion, you can see that as you move
the red dot around, the circle size of the motion corresponds exactly with how
strong the influence field is at various positions.

When no motion is selected, the diagram shows a mix of all the influence
fields that is more blue where a single motion dominates and less blue where
many motions contribute to the blend.

## Positions

You can change the positions of a motion by clicking on its corresponding blue
dot in the diagram and dragging it around. You can also edit position
coordinates of a motion in the motion list by typing in numbers in the number
fields in the Pos X and Pos Y columns.

The **Compute Positions** drop-down will set the positions from data of your
choice obtained from the **root motions** Motion of character’s root node,
whether it’s controlled by the animation itself or externally. [More
info](RootMotion.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#RootMotion) in the Animation Clips. The data
that is available to choose from is speed, velocity x, y, or z, and angular
speed in degrees or radians. If one or both of your **parameters** correspond
to one of these properties, you can compute the Pos X and/or Pos Y using the
Compute Positions drop-down.

**_Property:_** | **_Function:_**  
---|---  
**Velocity XZ** | Sets the Pos X of each motion according to its velocity.x and the Pos Y according to its velocity.z.  
**Speed And Angular Speed** | Sets the Pos X of each motion according to its angular speed (in radians per second) and the Pos Y according to its speed.  
  
Furthermore you can mix and match by choosing **Compute Position - > X
Position From** and/or **Compute Position - > Y Position From** to only auto-
compute one of them at a time, leaving the other unchanged.

**_Property:_** | **_Function:_**  
---|---  
**Speed** | Sets the Pos X or Pos Y of each motion according to its speed (the magnitude of the velocity).  
**Velocity X** | Sets the Pos X or Pos Y of each motion according to its velocity.x.  
**Velocity Y** | Sets the Pos X or Pos Y of each motion according to its velocity.y.  
**Velocity Z** | Sets the Pos X or Pos Y of each motion according to its velocity.z.  
**Angular Speed (Rad)** | Sets the Pos X or Pos Y of each motion according to its angular speed in radians per second.  
**Angular Speed (Deg)** | Sets the Pos X or Pos Y of each motion according to its angular speed in degrees per second.  
  
Say, for example, that your parameters correspond to sideways velocity and
forward velocity, and that you have an idle animation with an average velocity
(0, 0, 0), a walk animation with (0, 0, 1.5), and two strafe animations with
velocities of (–1.5, 0, 0) and (1.5, 0, 0) respectively. Choosing the
_Velocity XZ_ option from the drop-down would set the positions of the motions
according to the X and Z coordinates of those velocities.
