Real-time shadows

# Enable or disable shadows

You can configure the real-time and baked shadow settings for each [Light
component](class-Light.html) using the **Inspector** A Unity window that
displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project
settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. [More
info](UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Inspector).

Each [Mesh Renderer](class-MeshRenderer.html)A mesh component that takes the
geometry from the Mesh Filter and renders it at the position defined by the
object’s Transform component. [More info](class-MeshRenderer.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#MeshRenderer) in the **Scene** A Scene
contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene
file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles,
and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More
info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene) also has a **Cast Shadows** and a
**Receive Shadows** property, which must be enabled as required.

Enable **Cast Shadows** by selecting **On** from the drop-down menu to enable
or disable shadow casting for the **mesh** The main graphics primitive of
Unity. Meshes make up a large part of your 3D worlds. Unity supports
triangulated or Quadrangulated polygon meshes. Nurbs, Nurms, Subdiv surfaces
must be converted to polygons. [More info](mesh.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Mesh). Alternatively, select **Two Sided** to
allow shadows to be cast by either side of the surface (so backface culling is
ignored for shadow casting purposes), or **Shadows Only** to allow shadows to
be cast by an invisible **GameObject** The fundamental object in Unity scenes,
which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more.
A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it.
[More info](class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject).
