# Create a shader file

[Switch to Scripting](../ScriptReference/Shader.html "Go to Shader page in the
Scripting Reference")

A shader asset is an asset in your Unity project that defines a [Shader
object](shader-objects.html)An instance of the Shader class, a Shader object
is container for shader programs and GPU instructions, and information that
tells Unity how to use them. Use them with materials to determine the
appearance of your scene. [More info](shader-objects.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Shaderobject). It’s a text file with a
`.shader` extension. It contains [shader code](shader-writing.html).

  1. Select **Assets** Any media or data that can be used in your game or project. An asset may come from a file created outside of Unity, such as a 3D Model, an audio file or an image. You can also create some asset types in Unity, such as an Animator Controller, an Audio Mixer or a Render Texture. [More info](AssetWorkflow.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Asset) > **Create** > **Shader** A program
that runs on the GPU. [More info](Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Shader) from the main menu.

  2. Create a shader.

You can create the following types of shaders:

Shader type | Description  
---|---  
[Standard Surface Shader](SL-SurfaceShaders.html) | A shader that lets you write streamlined shader code that interacts with lighting.  
Unlit Shader | A basic shader that displays a texture without any lighting.  
Image Effect Shader | A shader file associated with a C# script that creates an [image effect](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.postprocessing@latest).  
[Compute Shader](class-ComputeShader.html) | A shader that performs calculations on the GPU, outside of the regular graphics pipeline.  
**Ray Tracing** The process of generating an image by tracing out rays from
the Camera through each pixel and recording the color contribution at the hit
point. This is an alternative to rasterization. raytracing  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Raytracing) Shader | A shader that performs calculations related to ray tracing.  
  
Unity populates a new `.shader` file in your `Assets` folder with basic code.

## Create a shader file manually

To define a Shader object in **ShaderLab** Unity’s language for defining the
structure of Shader objects. [More info](SL-Shader.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#ShaderLab), use a `Shader` block. This page
contains information on using `Shader` blocks.

For information on how a Shader object works, and the relationship between
Shader objects, SubShaders and Passes, see [Shader objects
introduction](shader-objects.html).

This example code demonstrates the basic syntax and structure of a Shader
object. The example Shader object has a single SubShader that contains a
single pass. It defines Material properties, a CustomEditor, and a Fallback.

    
    
    Shader "Examples/ShaderSyntax"
    {
        CustomEditor = "ExampleCustomEditor"
    
        Properties
        {
            // Material property declarations go here
        }
        SubShader
        {
            // The code that defines the rest of the SubShader goes here
    
            Pass
            {
               // The code that defines the Pass goes here
            }
        }
    
        Fallback "ExampleFallbackShader"
    }
    

For example custom shaders that are compatible with different **render
pipelines** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and
displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render
pipelines, or write your own. [More info](render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Renderpipeline), see [Example custom
shaders](built-in-shader-examples.html)

##  Legacy shader names

Prior to Unity 5.0, some of the functionality of a shader was determined by
its path and name. This is still how [Unity’s Legacy Shaders](Built-
inShaderGuide.html) work. Changing the name of these shaders can affect their
functionality.

## Disable Auto-Upgrade

`UNITY_SHADER_NO_UPGRADE` allows you to disable Unity from automatically
upgrading or modifying your shader file.
