# XR project set up

To set up a Unity project for **XR** An umbrella term encompassing Virtual
Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality (MR) applications.
Devices supporting these forms of interactive applications can be referred to
as XR devices. [More info](XR.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#XR):

  * Use the **XR**Plug-in** A set of code created outside of Unity that creates functionality in Unity. There are two kinds of plug-ins you can use in Unity: Managed plug-ins (managed .NET assemblies created with tools like Visual Studio) and Native plug-ins (platform-specific native code libraries). [More info](./plug-ins.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Plug-in) Management** settings to enable and
configure the plug-ins needed for the XR devices and platforms supported by
the project

  * Add XR support packages, such as **AR** Augmented Reality [More info](AROverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#AR) Foundation and the XR Interaction Toolkit

  * Add the components and **GameObjects** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject) to your **Scenes** A Scene
contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene
file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles,
and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More
info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene) needed to support XR

[Create an XR project](xr-create-projects.html) | How to create a Unity project for XR development.  
[Set up an XR scene](xr-scene-setup.html) | Understand how to set up your scene for XR, including input options, XR origin, and XR Plug-in management settings.

**Note:** When you create a Unity project, you can use one of the **XR
templates** available in the Unity Hub. These templates create the project
with selected XR packages already added to the project. Even when you start
with a template, you must configure the project as outlined in this section.
