# Creating a new package draft

A package draft is a version of your package before you submit it to the
**Asset Store** A growing library of free and commercial assets created by
Unity and members of the community. Offers a wide variety of assets, from
textures, models and animations to whole project examples, tutorials and
Editor extensions. [More info](AssetStore.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#AssetStore). At a minimum, a draft represents
the information on the **Create new package** page, but it can also include
the Assets from your Project.

To create a new draft:

  1. Open the [Asset Store Publisher](https://publisher.assetstore.unity3d.com/) portal and navigate to the **Packages** tab.

![The Packages tab displays any packages or package drafts on your Publisher
Account](../uploads/Main/ASPG_CreateNewPackage.png) The Packages tab displays
any packages or package drafts on your Publisher Account

  2. Click **Create New Package** to create a package draft.

The **Create new package** page appears.

  3. You can [fill out the package details](AssetStorePkgDetails.html) before or after you add your Assets to the package draft.

When you have a package draft, you can [add and upload your
Assets](AssetStoreUpload.html) to it.
