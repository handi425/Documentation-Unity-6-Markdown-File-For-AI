GUI Style (IMGUI System)

# GUI Skin (IMGUI System)

[Switch to Scripting](../ScriptReference/GUISkin.html "Go to GUISkin page in
the Scripting Reference")

**GUISkins** are a collection of **GUIStyles** that can be applied to your
GUI. Each **Control** type has its own Style definition. Skins are intended to
allow you to apply style to an entire **UI**(User Interface) Allows a user to
interact with your application. Unity currently supports three UI systems.
[More info](UI-system-compare.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#UI), instead of a single Control by itself.

To create a GUISkin, select **Assets- >Create->GUI Skin** from the menubar.

**Please Note** : This page refers to part of the
[IMGUI](GUIScriptingGuide.html) system, which is a _scripting-only_ UI system.
Unity has a full GameObject-based UI system which you may prefer to use. It
allows you to design and edit user interface elements as visible objects in
the **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think
of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your
environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building
your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene) view. See the [UI System
Manual](com.unity.ugui.html) for more information.

## Properties

All of the properties within a GUI Skin are an individual [GUIStyle](class-
GUIStyle.html). Please read the [GUIStyle](class-GUIStyle.html) page for more
information about how to use Styles.

## Details

When you are creating an entire GUI for your game, you will likely need to do
a lot of customization for every different Control type. In many different
game genres, like real-time strategy or role-playing, there is a need for
practically every single Control type.

Because each individual Control uses a particular Style, it does not make
sense to create a dozen-plus individual Styles and assign them all manually.
GUI Skins take care of this problem for you. By creating a GUI Skin, you have
a pre-defined collection of Styles for every individual Control. You then
apply the Skin with a single line of code, which eliminates the need to
manually specify the Style of each individual Control.

### Creating GUISkins

GUISkins are asset files. To create a GUI Skin, select **Assets- >Create->GUI
Skin** from the menubar. This will put a new GUISkin in your **Project View**.

ProjectView.png) A new GUISkin file in the Project View

### Editing GUISkins

After you have created a GUISkin, you can edit all of the [Styles](class-
GUIStyle.html) it contains in the **Inspector** A Unity window that displays
information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project
settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. [More
info](UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Inspector). For example, the **Text Field**
[Style](class-GUIStyle.html) will be applied to all Text Field Controls.

![Editing the Text Field Style in a GUISkin](../uploads/Main/imgui/GUISkin-
EditingTextField.png) Editing the Text Field Style in a GUISkin

No matter how many Text Fields you create in your script, they will all use
this [Style](class-GUIStyle.html). Of course, you have control over changing
the styles of one Text Field over the other if you wish. We’ll discuss how
that is done next.

### Applying GUISkins

To apply a GUISkin to your GUI, you must use a simple script to read and apply
the Skin to your Controls.

    
    
        // Create a public variable where we can assign the GUISkin
        var customSkin : GUISkin;
    
        // Apply the Skin in our OnGUI() function
        function OnGUI () {
            GUI.skin = customSkin;
    
            // Now create any Controls you like, and they will be displayed with the custom Skin
            GUILayout.Button ("I am a re-Skinned Button");
    
            // You can change or remove the skin for some Controls but not others
            GUI.skin = null;
    
            // Any Controls created here will use the default Skin and not the custom Skin
            GUILayout.Button ("This Button uses the default UnityGUI Skin");
        }
    
    
    

In some cases you want to have two of the same Control with different Styles.
For this, it does not make sense to create a new Skin and re-assign it.
Instead, you use one of the **Custom** Styles in the skin. Provide a **Name**
for the custom Style, and you can use that name as the last argument of the
individual Control.

    
    
        // One of the custom Styles in this Skin has the name "MyCustomControl"
        var customSkin : GUISkin;
    
        function OnGUI () {
            GUI.skin = customSkin;
    
            // We provide the name of the Style we want to use as the last argument of the Control function
            GUILayout.Button ("I am a custom styled Button", "MyCustomControl");
    
            // We can also ignore the Custom Style, and use the Skin's default Button Style
            GUILayout.Button ("I am the Skin's Button Style");
        }

[GUIStyle](class-GUIStyle.html) page. For more information about using
UnityGUI, please read the [GUI Scripting Guide](GUIScriptingGuide.html).
