Character control

# Built-in 3D Physics

Unity’s built-in 3D **physics engine** A system that simulates aspects of
physical systems so that objects can accelerate correctly and be affected by
collisions, gravity and other forces. [More info](PhysicsSection.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#PhysicsEngine) is an integration of the Nvidia
PhysX engine. You can use this engine in object-oriented 3D projects.

This section includes the following topics.

**Topic** | **Description**  
---|---  
**[Character control](character-control-section.html)** | Configure physics-based character control for first-person and third-person characters.  
**[Rigidbody physics](rigidbody-physics-section.html)** | Apply physics-based behavior to **GameObjects** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject).  
**[Collision](collision-section.html) A collision occurs when the physics
engine detects that the colliders of two GameObjects make contact or overlap,
when at least one has a Rigidbody component and is in motion. [More
info](CollidersOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Collision)** | Use **colliders** An invisible shape that is used to handle physical collisions for an object. A collider doesn’t need to be exactly the same shape as the object’s mesh - a rough approximation is often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay. [More info](CollidersOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Collider) to configure collisions between
GameObjects.  
**[Joints](joints-section.html) A physics component allowing a dynamic
connection between Rigidbody components, usually allowing some degree of
movement such as a hinge. [More info](Joints.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#joint)** | Apply and configure joints that connect GameObjects and simulate physical forces for pivoting, movement, and restriction.  
**[Articulations](articulations-section.html)** | Configure complex systems of rigid bodies and joints.  
**[Ragdoll physics](ragdoll-physics-section.html)** | Configure ragdoll physics for characters.  
**[Cloth](class-Cloth.html) A component that works with the Skinned Mesh
Renderer to provide a physics-based solution for simulating fabrics. [More
info](class-Cloth.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Cloth)** | Simulate fabric movement for character clothing and other in-application textiles.  
**[Multi-scene physics](physics-multi-scene.html)** | Manage different physics contexts in one project with multiple dedicated physics **scenes** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene).  
**[Physics Profiler module](ProfilerPhysics.html)** | Analyze the performance of physics in your application.
