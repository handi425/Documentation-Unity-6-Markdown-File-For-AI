# Mesh asset Inspector window reference

[Switch to Scripting](../ScriptReference/Mesh.html "Go to Mesh page in the
Scripting Reference")

A **Mesh** The main graphics primitive of Unity. Meshes make up a large part
of your 3D worlds. Unity supports triangulated or Quadrangulated polygon
meshes. Nurbs, Nurms, Subdiv surfaces must be converted to polygons. [More
info](mesh.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Mesh) asset represents a mesh in your Unity
project.

Unity creates mesh assets by default when it imports [models](models.html)A 3D
model representation of an object, such as a character, a building, or a piece
of furniture. [More info](3D-formats.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Model). You can also create mesh assets
directly in Unity, for example, by [creating a mesh with code](creating-
meshes.html) and saving the results as an asset.

Select a mesh asset in the ****Project window** A window that shows the
contents of your `Assets` folder (Project tab) [More info](ProjectView.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Projectwindow)** to open the
**Mesh**Inspector** A Unity window that displays information about the
currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to
inspect and edit the values. [More info](UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Inspector)**. This Inspector displays
information about the mesh, such as the total number of vertices or the names
of any blend shapes the mesh has. It also displays a visual preview of the
mesh.

### Mesh information

The Mesh Inspector displays information about how the mesh **asset stores** A
growing library of free and commercial assets created by Unity and members of
the community. Offers a wide variety of assets, from textures, models and
animations to whole project examples, tutorials and Editor extensions. [More
info](AssetStore.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#AssetStore) its data, but not the values in
the data itself. For example, the Inspector shows that Unity stores the value
for Position as a set of three Float32 values for each vertex, but it doesn’t
show the Position value of a specific vertex.

![The Mesh Inspector](../uploads/Main/mesh-inspector.png) The Mesh Inspector **Property** | **Description**  
---|---  
**Vertices** | The total number of vertices in the mesh, and how much on-disk storage and runtime memory Unity uses to store the vertex data for the mesh. For each vertex attribute, Unity shows how much on-disk storage and runtime memory Unity uses to store that attribute, and the data type that Unity uses for it.  
  
For more information about this data, see [Mesh data](AnatomyofaMesh.html).
For information about how Unity can compress data in a mesh, see the
[Compressing mesh data](compressing-mesh-data-optimization.html).  
**Indices** | The total number of indices in the mesh, how much on-disk storage and runtime memory Unity uses to store this data, and information about the indices for each sub-mesh.  
  
For more information about this data, see [Mesh data](AnatomyofaMesh.html).  
**Skin** | This section is only visible on a [skinned mesh](mesh-introduction.html#deformable-meshes).  
  
For more information about this data, see [Mesh data](AnatomyofaMesh.html).  
| **BlendWeight** | How many bones can affect a vertex.  
| **BlendIndices** | The indices of the bones that affect skinned vertices.  
| **Blend Shapes** | The total number of blend shapes in your mesh and lists their names. The number of frames next to each blend shape describes how many key frames each one has.  
**Other** | Shows additional information.  
| **Bounds Center** | A bounding box describes where the outermost edges of a mesh lie. The “Bounds Center” stores the location of the center of the mesh’s bounding box.  
| **Bounds Size** | Each value represents the length of the bounding box edges in X, Y and Z directions.  
| **Read/Write Enabled** | The value of the [Mesh.isReadable](../ScriptReference/Mesh-isReadable.html) property, which determines whether Unity can access and modify certain mesh data at runtime.  
  
You can set this value with the **Read/Write Enabled** checkbox in the [Model
Import Settings window](FBXImporter-Model.html).  
  
### Mesh preview

This part of the Inspector allows you to preview the appearance of a mesh and
explore the mesh data in a visual way.

You can use the following properties in the **UI**(User Interface) Allows a
user to interact with your application. Unity currently supports three UI
systems. [More info](UI-system-compare.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#UI) to configure the view:

**Property** | **Description**  
---|---  
**View mode** | Provides different ways of visualizing the mesh. See [Use the Mesh asset Inspector Preview](view-mesh-data-visualizations.html) for details of each **View Mode**.  
| **Shaded** | Provides a visualization of the mesh with a basic light. This is the default view. For more information, see [Shaded view](view-mesh-data-visualizations.html#shaded).  
| **UV Checker** | Applies a checkerboard texture to the mesh to visualize how the mesh’s UV map applies textures. For more information, see [UV Checker view](view-mesh-data-visualizations.html#uv-checker)  
| **UV Layout** | Displays how the vertices of the mesh are organized in the unwrapped UV map. This view disables the Wireframe toggle. For more information, see [UV Layout view](view-mesh-data-visualizations.html#uv-layout)  
| **Vertex Color** | Visualizes any vertex colors that the vertices in this mesh have. If no vertices have a vertex color, this menu item is disabled. For more information, see [Vertex Color view](view-mesh-data-visualizations.html#vertex-color)  
| **Normals** | Visualizes the relative directions of the normals in the mesh with color. For more information, see [Normals view](view-mesh-data-visualizations.html#normals)  
| **Tangents** | Visualizes the tangent data in the mesh with color. For more information, see [Tangents view](view-mesh-data-visualizations.html#tangents)  
| **Blendshapes** | Lets you preview blend shape deformations to the mesh. If the mesh has no blend shapes, this menu item is disabled. For more information, see [Blendshapes view](mesh-data-deformable-meshes.html#blend-shapes)  
**Wireframe** | Not available in UV Layout mode.  
  
If enabled, the preview displays a visualisation of the vertices and edges.
Otherwise, it doesn’t.  
**Channel picker** | Only available in UV Checker mode.  
  
This drop-down menu allows you to change which UV channel the preview
displays. If the mesh only uses one UV channel, then only “Channel 0” is
enabled.  
**Texture size** | Only available in UV Checker mode.  
  
This slider allows you to change the size of the checkered texture on the
mesh’s UV map.  
**Blend shape picker** | Only available in Blendshapes mode.  
  
This drop-down allows you to change the blend shape that Unity visualizes in
the mesh preview. When you select a different blend shape, Unity no longer
applies the previous blend shape to the mesh preview.
