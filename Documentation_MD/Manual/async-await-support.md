Introduction to asynchronous programming with Awaitable

# Asynchronous programming with the Awaitable class

Asynchronous programming allows your code to perform long-running tasks
without blocking the main thread. This allows your application to remain
responsive and perform other tasks while it waits for an asynchronous task to
complete.

Unity supports a simplified asynchronous programming model using the .NET
[async](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-
reference/keywords/async) key word and [await](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-
us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/await) operator.

Before reading about asynchronous programming in Unity, make sure you
understand the fundamental elements of asynchronous programming in .NET. For
important context, refer to [Asynchronous programming with async and
await](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/asynchronous-
programming/) and [Task asynchronous programming
model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/asynchronous-
programming/task-asynchronous-programming-model).

**Topic** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Introduction to Awaitable](async-awaitable-introduction.html) | Understand the key features of Unity’s `Awaitable` and how it compares to both .NET `Task` and iterator-based coroutines.  
[Awaitable completion and continuation](async-awaitable-continuations.html) | Understand how asynchronous code resumes on completion of an awaited task and how this affects the function and performance of your application.  
[Awaitable code example reference](async-awaitable-examples.html) | Solve common asynchronous programming problems with a reference of `Awaitable` code examples.
