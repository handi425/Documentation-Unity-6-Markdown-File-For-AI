Unity multiplayer overview

# Multiplayer

A multiplayer project can host many users in the same project, either locally
or through a networked server. To build a multiplayer game, use a combination
of Unity’s multiplayer packages and services. Refer to the [Unity multiplayer
overview](multiplayer-overview.html) for more information or refer to the
additional resources on this page.

If you’re just getting started with multiplayer games, the recommended entry
point is the [Multiplayer Center package](multiplayer-center.html), which
suggests Unity multiplayer packages based on the needs of your game, and gives
you access to samples and tutorials to help you use them.
