Creating and editing Terrains

# Terrain

The Unity Editor includes a built-in set of **Terrain** The landscape in your
scene. A Terrain GameObject adds a large flat plane to your scene and you can
use the Terrain’s Inspector window to create a detailed landscape. [More
info](terrain-UsingTerrains.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Terrain) features that you can use to add
landscapes to your game. In the Unity Editor, you can create multiple Terrain
tiles, adjust the height or appearance of your landscape, and add trees or
grass to it. At runtime, Unity optimizes built-in Terrain rendering for
efficiency. The pages in this section explain the built-in options available
for Terrain and how to use them.
