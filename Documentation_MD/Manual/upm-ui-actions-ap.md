# Add and remove asset packages

You can perform a variety of package management tasks by using the Package
Manager window.

Follow these tasks to manage **asset packages** A collection of files and data
from Unity projects, or elements of projects, which are compressed and stored
in one file, similar to Zip files, with the `.unitypackage` extension. Asset
packages are a handy way of sharing and re-using Unity projects and
collections of assets. [More info](AssetPackages.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Assetpackage). For information about managing
**UPM packages** A **Package** managed by the **Unity Package Manager**. Refer
to **Packages**.  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#UPMpackage) or **feature sets** A feature set
is a collection of related packages that you can use to achieve specific
results in the Unity Editor. You can manage feature sets directly in Unity’s
Package Manager. [More info](FeatureSets.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Featureset), refer to [Add and remove UPM
packages or feature sets](upm-ui-actions.html).
