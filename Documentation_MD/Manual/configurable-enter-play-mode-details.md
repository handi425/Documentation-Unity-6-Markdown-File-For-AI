# Details of disabling domain and scene reload

## What Unity skips when domain reload and scene reload is disabled

From a high-level perspective, entering Play mode consists of the following
main stages:

  * **Backup current scenes**. This only happens when the **Scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene) has been modified. Allows Unity to
revert the Scenes when exiting Play mode to the state they were in before Play
mode started.

  * **Domain reload**. Resets the scripting state, by reloading the scripting domain.
  * **Scene reload**. Resets the Scene state, by reloading the Scene.
  * **Update scene**. This happens twice; once without rendering, and once with rendering.

The combined tasks of domain reload and scene reload resets the scripting
domain and simulates the startup behavior of your application as it would run
in the Player. Unity skips these steps when you disable them in your **Project
Settings** A broad collection of settings which allow you to configure how
Physics, Audio, Networking, Graphics, Input and many other areas of your
project behave. [More info](comp-ManagerGroup.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#ProjectSettings).

The following diagram provides detailed information about the exact events
which Unity skips when domain reload and scene reload are disabled. Blue
indicates the events Unity skips when domain reload is disabled, and green
indicates the events Unity skips when scene reload is disabled.

## What Unity does when scene reloading and domain reloading are both enabled

With scene reload and domain reload enabled, this is the full list of all
processes and events that Unity performs when entering Play mode:

  1. The [AssemblyReloadEvent](../ScriptReference/AssemblyReloadEvents.html) `beforeAssemblyReload` event is raised.
  2. The C# domain is stopped:  
a. `OnDisable()` is called for all ScriptableObjects and MonoBehaviours.  
b. Unity waits for all async operations to finish.

  3. The state of all MonoBehaviours and ScriptableObjects is serialized.  
a. `OnBeforeSerialize()` is called.  
b. All public and private field values are serialized, except those marked
with `[NonSerialized]`.

  4. Managed wrappers are disconnected from native Unity objects.
  5. The Unity Child Domain is reloaded:  
a. Mono domain unload:  
i. The `AppDomain.DomainUnload` event is raised.  
ii. The Unity Child Domain is destroyed  
1\. GC and finalizers are called.  
2\. Threads are terminated.  
3\. All JIT info is deleted.  
b. The new Unity Child Domain is created.

  6. The assemblies are loaded:  
a. System assemblies are loaded.  
b. Unity assemblies are loaded.  
c. User assemblies are loaded.

  7. The synchronization context is initialized.
  8. The scripting state is restored.  
a. The scriptable part of all Unity objects is recreated.  
i. Constructors are called, and statics are assigned their default values.  
b. The state of all Unity objects is deserialized:  
i. The serialized states of all Unity objects are restored.  
1\. The `OnAfterDeserialize` event is raised.  
ii. `OnValidate()` is called.  
iii. For **scripts** A piece of code that allows you to create your own
Components, trigger game events, modify Component properties over time and
respond to user input in any way you like. [More info](creating-scripts.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scripts) using the `[ExecuteInEditMode]`
attribute:  
1\. `OnEnable()` is called.  
2\. `OnDisable()` is called.  
3\. `OnDestroy()` is called.

  9. Methods with the [InitializeOnLoad](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/InitializeOnLoadAttribute.html) and [InitializeOnLoadMethod](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/InitializeOnLoadMethodAttribute.html) are called.
  10. The [AssemblyReloadEvent](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/AssemblyReloadEvents.html) `afterAssemblyReload` is called.
