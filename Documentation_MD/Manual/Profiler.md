# Unity Profiler

The Unity **Profiler** is a tool you can use to get performance information
about your application. You can connect it to devices on your network or
devices connected to your computer to test how your application runs on your
intended release platform. You can also run it in the Unity Editor to get an
overview of resource allocation while you’re developing your application.
