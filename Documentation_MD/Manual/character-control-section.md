Introduction to character control

# Character control

In a first-person or third-person application, a user’s character or
**avatar** An interface for retargeting animation from one rig to another.
[More info](ConfiguringtheAvatar.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Avatar) usually needs some collision-based
physics, so that it doesn’t fall through the floor or walk through walls. In
3D physics, you can create and configure character physics and control with a
Character Controller.

You can configure character control via the
[`CharacterController`](../ScriptReference/CharacterController.html) class, or
the corresponding [Character Controller](class-CharacterController.html)A
simple, capsule-shaped collider component with specialized features for
behaving as a character in a game. Unlike true collider components, a
Rigidbody is not needed and the momentum effects are not realistic. [More
info](class-CharacterController.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#CharacterController) component.
