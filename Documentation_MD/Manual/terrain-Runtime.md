# Using Terrain at runtime

The **Terrain** The landscape in your scene. A Terrain GameObject adds a large
flat plane to your scene and you can use the Terrain’s Inspector window to
create a detailed landscape. [More info](terrain-UsingTerrains.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Terrain) system uses Unity engine resources to
function correctly. Unity includes these resources in your Player build when
you have at least one Terrain instance in a **Scene** A Scene contains the
environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a
unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and
decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More
info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene) that’s part of the build. If you only
create Terrain dynamically at runtime, make sure you include a Terrain
component somewhere in your build as a placeholder. You can disable that
Terrain instance (uncheck the box next to the Terrain name in the Inspector
window), and put it in a Scene that your game or app doesn’t load.
