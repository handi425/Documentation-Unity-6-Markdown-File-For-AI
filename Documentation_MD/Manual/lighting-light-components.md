Types of Light component

# Light components

Resources for adding lights to specific points in a **scene** A Scene contains
the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a
unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and
decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More
info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene), and how Unity calculates the shading
of **GameObjects** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent
characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s
functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](class-
GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject) based on the intensity, direction,
and color of lights.
