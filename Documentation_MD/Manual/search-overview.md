Search usage

# Unity Search

Use Search to search sources inside of Unity and perform actions on the
results.

For example, from the Search window you can find Assets and open them, find
Unity packages and install them, or find menu commands and run them.

## The Search window

To launch Search use the **Ctrl + K** shortcut, click the magnifying glass
icon in the top right of the Editor window, or use the menu (**Edit > Search
All**).

**Note:** You can customize the shortcut for Search in the [Shortcuts
Manager](UnityHotkeys.html).

---  
**A** | Search field | Enter your search query here.  
For details about all the ways you can search Unity with Search, see [Using
Search](search-usage.html).  
**B** | Saved Searches | Access your saved searches. To show/hide the pane, click the Saved Searches icon (![](../uploads/Main/search-saved-searches-icon.png)) or select **Searches** from the **More Options** (**:**) menu.   
To save your search query, use the Save icon to the right of the Search field.  
**C** | Results area | Displays search results as you type the search query.  
Items that best match the search query appear higher in the results. Search
also learns over time, and prioritizes items that you select often. See
[Search Preferences](Preferences.html#search) to learn how to customize search
result ordering.  
**D** | Search Provider | Allows you to see all results from standard [Search Providers](search-providers.html) (Project, Hierarchy, Settings) or from other Search Providers by using a specific search token. Select **More Options** (**:**) to access a list Search Providers.  
**E** | Preview **Inspector** A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. [More info](UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Inspector) | Allows you to view and change item properties, open, reimport or delete a search item, or copy a path. To show/hide the pane, click the Inspector icon (![](../uploads/Main/search-inspector-icon.png)) or select **Inspector** from the **More Options** (**:**) menu.  
**F** | Views and Preferences | Change Search [views](search-usage.html#search-view) and open the [**Preferences**](Preferences.html#search) window.  
  
## Unity Search Help

To get help with Search, select the question mark icon at the top of the
window. This opens the Search documentation.
