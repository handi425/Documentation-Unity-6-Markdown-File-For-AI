# Animation tab

[Switch to Scripting](../ScriptReference/AnimationClip.html "Go to
AnimationClip page in the Scripting Reference")

**Animation Clips** are the smallest building blocks of animation in Unity.
They represent an isolated piece of motion, such as RunLeft, Jump, or Crawl,
and can be manipulated and combined in various ways to produce lively end
results (see [Animation State Machines](AnimationStateMachines.html)A graph
within an Animator Controller that controls the interaction of Animation
States. Each state references an Animation Blend Tree or a single Animation
Clip. [More info](AnimationStateMachines.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#AnimationStateMachine), [Animator
Controller](class-AnimatorController.html)Controls animation through Animation
Layers with Animation State Machines and Animation Blend Trees, controlled by
Animation Parameters. The same Animator Controller can be referenced by
multiple models with Animator components. [More info](class-
AnimatorController.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#AnimatorController), or [Blend Trees](class-
BlendTree.html)). You can select Animation Clips from imported FBX data.

When you click on the model containing animation clips, these properties
appear:

![The Animation Clip Inspector](../uploads/Main/classAnimationClip-
Inspector.png) The Animation Clip Inspector

There are five areas on the **Animation** tab of the **Inspector** A Unity
window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject,
asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. [More
info](UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Inspector) window:

**(A)** Asset-specific properties. These settings define import options for
the entire Asset.

**(B)** Clip selection list. You can select any item from this list to display
its properties and preview its animation. You can also [define new
clips](Splittinganimations.html).

**(C)** Clip-specific properties. These settings define import options for the
selected **Animation Clip**.

**(D)** Clip properties. These settings define import options for all
Animation clips.

**(E)** Animation preview. You can playback the animation and select specific
frames here.

## Asset-specific properties

![Import options for the entire Asset](../uploads/Main/classAnimationClip-
Inspector_Asset.png) Import options for the entire Asset

These properties apply to all animation clips and constraints defined within
this Asset:

**Property:** | **Function:**  
---|---  
**Import Constraints** | Import [constraints](Constraints.html)Settings on Joint components which limit movement or rotation. The type and number of constraints vary depending on the type of Joint. [More info](2d-physics/joints/2d-joints-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Constraints) from this asset.  
**Import Animation** | Import animation from this asset.   
  
**_Note:_** If disabled, all other options on this page are hidden and no
animation is imported.  
**Bake Animations** | Bake animations created using IK or Simulation to forward kinematic keyframes.   
  
Only available for Autodesk® Maya®, Autodesk® 3ds Max® and Cinema 4D files.  
**Resample Curves** | Resample animation curves as Quaternion values and generate a new Quaternion keyframe for every frame in the animation.   
  
This option only appears if the import file contains Euler curves. This option
is enabled by default.  
  
Disable this option to [keep animation curves as they were originally
authored](AnimationEulerCurveImport.html). You should only disable this option
if there are interpolation issues in the resampled animation when compared
with your original animation.  
**Anim. Compression** | The type of **compression** A method of storing data that reduces the amount of storage space it requires. See [Texture Compression](class-TextureImporterOverride), [Animation Compression](class-AnimationClip.html#AssetProperties), [Audio Compression](class-AudioClip.html), [Build Compression](ReducingFilesize.html).  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#compression) to use when importing the
animation.  
| **Off** | Disable **animation compression** The method of compressing animation data to significantly reduce file sizes without causing a noticeable reduction in motion quality. Animation compression is a trade off between saving on memory and image quality. [More info](class-AnimationClip.html#AssetProperties)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#animationcompression). This means that Unity
doesn’t reduce **keyframe** A frame that marks the start or end point of a
transition in an animation. Frames in between the keyframes are called
inbetweens.  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#keyframe) count on import. Disabling animation
compression leads to the highest precision animations, but slower performance
and bigger file and runtime memory size. It is generally not advisable to use
this option - if you need higher precision animation, you should enable
keyframe reduction and lower allowed **Animation Compression Error** values
instead.  
| **Keyframe Reduction** A process that removes redundant keyframes. [More
info](class-AnimationClip.html#AssetProperties)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#KeyframeReduction) | Reduce redundant keyframes on import. If enabled, the Inspector displays **Animation Compression Errors** options. This affects both file size (runtime memory) and how curves are evaluated.  
  
Applies to **Legacy** , **Generic** , and **Humanoid** [Animation
Type](FBXImporter-Rig.html) rigs.  
| **Keyframe Reduction and Compression** | Reduce keyframes on import and compress keyframes when storing animations in files. This affects only file size: the runtime memory size is the same as **Keyframe Reduction**. If enabled, the Inspector displays **Animation Compression Errors** options.  
  
Only for **Legacy** [Animation Type](FBXImporter-Rig.html) rigs.  
| **Optimal** | Let Unity decide how to compress, either by keyframe reduction or by using dense format. If enabled, the Inspector displays **Animation Compression Errors** options.  
  
Only for **Generic** and **Humanoid** [Animation Type](FBXImporter-Rig.html)
rigs.  
**Animation Compression Errors** | Only available when **Keyframe Reduction** or **Optimal** compression is enabled.  
| **Rotation Error** | Set the error tolerance (as an angle in degrees) for rotation curve compression. Unity uses this to determine whether or not it can remove a key on a rotation curve.   
  
This represents the minimum angle between the original rotation value and the
reduced value:  
  
`Angle(value, reduced) < RotationError`  
| **Position Error** | Set the error tolerance (as a percentage) for position curve compression. Unity uses this to determine whether or not it can remove a key on a position curve. For more information, see Setting error tolerance for key reduction on position and scale curves.  
| **Scale Error** | Set the error tolerance (as a percentage) for scale curve compression. Unity uses this to determine whether or not it can remove a key on a scale curve. For more information, see Setting error tolerance for key reduction on position and scale curves.  
**Animated Custom Properties** | Import any FBX properties that you designated as custom user properties.   
  
Unity only supports a small subset of properties when importing FBX files
(such as translation, rotation, scale and visibility). However, you can treat
standard FBX properties like user properties by naming them in your importer
script via the [extraUserProperties](../ScriptReference/ModelImporter-
extraUserProperties.html) member. During import, Unity then passes any named
properties to [the Asset
postprocessor](../ScriptReference/AssetPostprocessor.OnPostprocessGameObjectWithUserProperties.html)
just like ‘real’ user properties.  
  
### Setting error tolerance for key reduction on position and scale curves

Set the error tolerance percentage to determine whether or not Unity can
remove a key on a position or scale curve as a strategy for animation
compression.

When you set the **Anim. Compression** property to “Keyframe Reduction” or
“Optimal”, Unity compares the original curve to what the curve looks like
after removing a specific keyframe and applies this test:

    
    
    OriginalValue - ReducedValue > OriginalValue * percentageOfError
    

Unity removes a keyframe if the delta between the original value and the
reduced value is less than the original value multiplied by the error
tolerance percentage.

Note that the Unity compares the distances between the three curve components
(that is, it compares `distance(x,y,z)` ), and also per component (
`distance(x)`, `distance(y)`, and then `distance(z)` ).

This example demonstrates how Unity evaluates a reduction on the y-axis using
an error tolerance of 10%:

![Define a position error of 10% on a simple animation of a translation on the
y-axis](../uploads/Main/classAnimationClip-tolerance_Ex1.png) Define a
position error of 10% on a simple animation of a translation on the y-axis

Keyframe A has a value of 11.2:

![Keyframe A has a value of 11.2](../uploads/Main/classAnimationClip-
tolerance_Ex2.png) Keyframe A has a value of 11.2

Keyframe B has a value of 11.1:

![Keyframe B has a value of 11.1](../uploads/Main/classAnimationClip-
tolerance_Ex3.png) Keyframe B has a value of 11.1

The resulting reduced curve looks like this:

![The resulting reduced curve](../uploads/Main/classAnimationClip-
tolerance_Ex4.png) The resulting reduced curve

**Keyframe A is not reduced** because:

  * The distance between the original and reduced value is `D = 11.2 - 10 = 1.2`.
  * The error margin is `E = 10% * 11.2 = 1.12`
  * **D > E**

**Keyframe B is reduced** because `11.1 - 10 < 10% * 11.1`:

  * The distance between the original and reduced value is `D = 11.1 - 10 = 1.11`
  * The error margin is `E = 10% * 11.1 = 1.11`
  * **D = E**

Note that this method has a limitation when using high values that vary only
slightly. Moving the **Scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of
your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene,
you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing
and building your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene) 1000 units away results in essentially
the same animation but located far from 0.

![High values with small variance](../uploads/Main/classAnimationClip-
tolerance_Ex5.png) High values with small variance

In this case, both keyframes are reduced.

**Keyframe A is reduced** because:

  * The distance between the original and reduced value is `D = 1011.2 - 1010 = 1.2`
  * The error margin is `E = 10% * 1011.2 = 101.12`

**Keyframe B is reduced** because `11.1 - 10 < 10% * 11.1`:

  * The distance between the original and reduced value is `D = 11.1 - 10 = 1.11`
  * The error margin is `E = 10% * 1011.1 = 101.11`

Higher values require a much larger difference between the original and
reduced values for keyframes to remain in the reduced curve. Keyframe A has a
value of 1100 and is discarded; keyframe B has a value of 1112 and remains:

![Higher values require a much larger
difference](../uploads/Main/classAnimationClip-tolerance_Ex6.png) Higher
values require a much larger difference

## Clip selection list

![List of clips defined in this file](../uploads/Main/classAnimationClip-
Inspector_Selection.png) List of clips defined in this file

You can perform these tasks in this area of the **Animation** tab:

  * Select a clip from the list to display its clip-specific properties.
  * Play a selected clip in the clip preview pane.
  * [Create a new clip](Splittinganimations.html) for this file with the add (`+`) button.
  * Remove the selected clip definition with the delete (`-`) button.

If you manually change properties of imported clips, Unity does not import new
animation clips when the source Asset changes. For example, if you create a
new clip or change a clip timing on the **Animation** tab, the clip list does
not update even if you add clips to the FBX file from outside Unity. To view
new and changed animation clips, you must [add a new source take to the clip
list](Splittinganimations.html).

## Clip-specific properties

![Import options for the selected Animation
clip](../uploads/Main/classAnimationClip-Inspector_Clip.png) Import options
for the selected Animation clip

This area of the **Animation** tab displays these features:

**(A)** The editable name of the selected clip.

**(B)** The animation clip timeline.

**(C)** Clip properties to control looping, **root motion** Motion of
character’s root node, whether it’s controlled by the animation itself or
externally. [More info](RootMotion.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#RootMotion) extraction, curves, events and
**Avatar** An interface for retargeting animation from one rig to another.
[More info](ConfiguringtheAvatar.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Avatar) masks.

You can set these properties separately for each animation clip defined within
this asset:

---|---  
**_Area A_**  
![The name of the source take](../uploads/Main/classAnimationClip-Name.png)  
**Take name** | The name of the source take in the source file. Source files contain a set of source takes that are created in external 3D applications such as Motionbuilder or Autodesk® Maya®.

**_Area B_**  
![The timeline editor](../uploads/Main/classAnimationClip-Timeline.png) | Drag the start and end indicators on the animation timeline to define frame ranges for each clip.  
  
Creating clips is essentially defining the start and end points for segments
of animation. [To define a looping clip](LoopingAnimationClips.html), trim the
start and end points so that the first and last frames match as best as
possible. You can also zoom and scroll the timeline to be more precise.

## Properties for all clips

These expandable properties apply to all Animation clips being imported.

![Import options for all Animation clips](../uploads/Main/classAnimationClip-Inspector_AllClips.png) Import options for all Animation clips **Property:** | **Function:**  
---|---  
**Motion** | Expand this section to manage [the root motion node for all imported clips](AnimationRootMotionNodeOnImportedClips.html).  
**Import Messages** | Expand this section to see detailed information about how your animation was imported, including an optional _**Retargeting** Applying animations created for one model to another. [More info](Retargeting.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Retargeting) Quality Report_.  
  
## Animation import warnings

If any problems occur during the animation import process, a warning appears
at the top of the Animations Import inspector:

![Animation import warning messages](../uploads/Main/AnimationWarningBox.png)
Animation import warning messages

The warnings do not necessarily mean your animation has not imported or
doesn’t work. It may just mean that the imported animation looks slightly
different from the source animation.

To see more information, expand the **Import Messages** section:

![Animation import warning
messages](../uploads/Main/AnimationWarningSection.png) Animation import
warning messages

In this case, Unity has provided a **Generate Retargeting Quality Report**
option which you can enable to see more specific information on the
retargeting problems.

Other warning details you may see include the following:

  * Default bone length found in this file is different from the one found in the source avatar.
  * Inbetween bone default rotation found in this file is different from the one found in the source avatar.
  * Source avatar hierarchy doesn’t match one found in this model.
  * This animation has Has translation animation that will be discarded.
  * **Humanoid animation** An animation using humanoid skeletons. Humanoid models generally have the same basic structure, representing the major articulate parts of the body, head and limbs. This makes it easy to map animations from one humanoid skeleton to another, allowing retargeting and inverse kinematics. [More info](ConfiguringtheAvatar.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Humanoidanimation) has inbetween transforms
and rotation that will be discarded.

  * Has scale animation that will be discarded.

These messages indicate that some data present in your original file was
omitted when Unity imported and converted your animation to its own internal
format. These warnings essentially tell you that the retargeted animation may
not exactly match the source animation.

**Note:** Unity does not support pre- and post-extrapolate modes (also known
as pre- and post-infinity modes) other than **constant** , and converts these
to **constant** when imported.

## Animation preview

![Animation clip preview](../uploads/Main/classAnimationClip-
Inspector_Preview.png) Animation clip preview

The preview area of the **Animation** tab provides these features:

**(A)** The name of the selected clip.

**(B)** The [2D](Unity2D.html) preview mode button (switches between
orthographic and perspective camera).

**(C)** The pivot and mass center display button (switches between displaying
and hiding the gizmos).

**(D)** The Avatar selector (change which GameObject will preview the action).

**(E)** The play/pause button.

**(F)** The playback head on the preview timeline (allows scrubbing back and
forth).

**(G)** The animation preview speed slider (move left to slow down; right to
speed up).

**(H)** The playback status indicator (displays the location of the playback
in seconds, percentage, and frame number).

**(I)** The **Tag** A reference word which you can assign to one or more
GameObjects to help you identify GameObjects for scripting purposes. For
example, you might define and “Edible” Tag for any item the player can eat in
your game. [More info](Tags.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Tag) bar, where you can define and apply
[Tags](Tags.html) to your clip.

**(J)** The [AssetBundles](AssetBundlesIntro.html) bar, where you can [define
AssetBundles and Variants](AssetBundles-Workflow.html).
