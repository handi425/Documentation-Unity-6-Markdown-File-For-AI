Introduction to joints

# Joints

A **Joint** A physics component allowing a dynamic connection between
Rigidbody components, usually allowing some degree of movement such as a
hinge. [More info](Joints.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#joint) connects a **Rigidbody** A component
that allows a GameObject to be affected by simulated gravity and other forces.
[More info](class-Rigidbody.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Rigidbody) to another Rigidbody, or to a fixed
point in space. Joints can apply forces that move rigid bodies, and joint
limits can restrict that movement.

You can configure Joints via the [`Joint`](../ScriptReference/Joint.html)
class, or the appropriate Joint component.

**Topic** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Introduction to joints](Joints.html) | Overview of the concepts and behaviours of physics joints in Unity.  
[Character Joint component reference](class-CharacterJoint.html) | Reference for the **Character Joint** An extended ball-socket joint which allows a joint to be limited on each axis. Mainly used for Ragdoll effects. [More info](class-CharacterJoint.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#CharacterJoint) component.  
[Fixed Joint component reference](class-FixedJoint.html) | Reference for the **Fixed Joint** A joint type that is completely constrained, allowing two objects to be held together. Implemented as a spring so some motion may still occur. [More info](class-FixedJoint.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#FixedJoint) component.  
[Hinge Joint component reference](class-HingeJoint.html) | Reference for the **Hinge Joint** A joint that groups together two Rigidbody components, constraining them to move like they are connected by a hinge. It is perfect for doors, but can also be used to model chains, pendulums and so on. [More info](class-HingeJoint.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#HingeJoint) component.  
[Spring Joint component reference](class-SpringJoint.html) | Reference for the **Spring Joint** A joint type that connects two Rigidbody components together but allows the distance between them to change as though they were connected by a spring. [More info](class-SpringJoint.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#SpringJoint) component.  
[Create a configurable joint](create-configurable-joint.html) | Create a configurable custom joint that has fine controls for constricting motion and specifying driving forces.
