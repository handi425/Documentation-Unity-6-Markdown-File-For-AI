Naming scripts

# Creating scripts

Scripts allow you to customize and extend the capabilities of your applicaton
with C# code. With **scripts** that derive from Unity’s built-in
[MonoBehaviour](class-MonoBehaviour.html) class you can create your own custom
Components to control the behavior of **GameObjects** The fundamental object
in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras,
waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components
attached to it. [More info](class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject). With scripts that derive from
[ScriptableObject](class-ScriptableObject.html) you can store large amounts of
data efficiently in your application. Alternatively, you can start with an
empty C# script to develop your own non-Unity classes.

Unlike most other assets, scripts are usually created within Unity directly.
To create a new script:

  * From the main menu: go to **Assets > Create > Scripting** and select the type of script you want to create.

Or:

  * From the Create menu (plus sign) in the [Project window toolbar](ProjectView.html): go to **Scripting** and select the type of script you want to create.

This creates a new script in whichever folder you have selected in the Project
panel. It also selects the script’s file name for editing, prompting you to
change the name. For things you should take into account when naming your
scripts, refer to [Naming considerations for scripts](naming-scripts.html).
