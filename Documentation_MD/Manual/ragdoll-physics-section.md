# Ragdoll physics

Ragdoll physics are a set of **colliders** An invisible shape that is used to
handle physical collisions for an object. A collider doesn’t need to be
exactly the same shape as the object’s mesh - a rough approximation is often
more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay. [More
info](CollidersOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Collider), rigid bodies and **joints** A
physics component allowing a dynamic connection between Rigidbody components,
usually allowing some degree of movement such as a hinge. [More
info](Joints.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#joint) that you can apply to a humanoid
character, to simulate behaviour such as impact **collisions** A collision
occurs when the physics engine detects that the colliders of two GameObjects
make contact or overlap, when at least one has a Rigidbody component and is in
motion. [More info](CollidersOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Collision) and character death.

Unity provides a [Ragdoll Wizard](wizard-RagdollWizard.html) that allows you
to configure ragdoll physics behaviours on your character.
