# Brushes

When you apply a tool such as [Paint Texture](terrain-PaintTexture.html) or
[Smooth Height](terrain-SmoothHeight.html) to the **Terrain** The landscape in
your scene. A Terrain GameObject adds a large flat plane to your scene and you
can use the Terrain’s Inspector window to create a detailed landscape. [More
info](terrain-UsingTerrains.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Terrain), Unity uses a Brush, which is a
[ScriptableObject](../ScriptReference/ScriptableObject.html) in the Terrain
system. The Brush defines the tool’s shape and strength of influence.

## Built-in Brushes

Unity comes with a collection of built-in Brushes. They range from simple
circles for quickly sketching designs, to more randomized scatter shapes that
are good for creating detail and natural-looking features.

Inspector](../uploads/Main/1.5-BuiltInBrushes_grey.png) Built-in Brushes in
the Terrain Inspector

You can also select Brush Masks from the Terrain overlays. To see available
Brush Masks from the Terrain overlays, select a Terrain tool that you can use
to paint.

## Custom Brushes

You can create your own custom Brushes with unique shapes or specific
parameters for your needs. For example, use the **heightmap** A greyscale
Texture that stores height data for an object. Each pixel stores the height
difference perpendicular to the face that pixel represents.  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Heightmap) Texture of a specific geological
feature to define a Brush, then use the [Stamp Terrain](terrain-
StampTerrain.html) tool to place that feature on your Terrain.

To create a new Brush, click the **New Brush** button in the Terrain
**Inspector** A Unity window that displays information about the currently
selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and
edit the values. [More info](UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Inspector) window.

Inspector](../uploads/Main/1.5-NewBrushButton_grey.png) New Brush button in
the Terrain Inspector

After you click **New Brush** , the **Select Texture2D** window appears.
Choose a Texture to define the shape of your new Brush, then use the Brush
Inspector to adjust the **Falloff** and **Radius Scale** values.

Texture](../uploads/Main/1.5-Select2DTexture_grey.png) Window for selecting
Brush Texture

Alternatively, right-click in the **Project** In Unity, you use a project to
design and develop a game. A project stores all of the files that are related
to a game, such as the asset and Scene files. [More info](2Dor3D.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Project) window, and choose **Create > Brush**
to create a new Brush. The default Brush shows a simple circle defined by a
white **Mask Texture** , a **Falloff** curve, and a **Radius Scale** of 1. Use
the Brush Inspector to change these values, or set a Texture to define the
shape of the Brush. You can also use the **Remap** slider and the **Invert
Remap Range** option to further modify the grayscale values of the **Brush**
Texture.

settings](../uploads/Main/1.5-BrushInspector_grey.png) Brush Inspector with
default settings

## Brush settings

**Property** | **Function**  
---|---  
**Mask Texture** | Defines the shape and strength of the Brush. Select a Texture in your project, and the system creates a grayscale mask from the Texture. If the selected Texture has multiple color channels, the Brush uses the Red channel as its source.  
**Remap** | Remaps the grayscale values of the Brush mask, after applying the Falloff curve. The Editor remaps black values in the Brush mask to the value you select using the left side of the slider, and remaps white values in the Brush mask to the value you select using the right side of the slider.  
**Invert Remap Range** | Inverts the left and right sides of the **Remap** slider, which basically inverts the values of the entire mask.  
**Falloff** | Defines a curve that affects the strength of the Brush in a circular fashion. Click the Falloff curve to open the Unity [Curve Editor](EditingCurves.html), where you can edit the curve to create effects ranging from smooth fades to sharp edges.  
**Radius Scale** | Affects the scale of the falloff curve. Use this option to increase or decrease the radius of the curve.
