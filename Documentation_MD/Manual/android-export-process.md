# Export an Android project

If you need more control over the build pipeline, you can export a Unity
project as a **Gradle** An Android build system that automates several build
processes. This automation means that many common build errors are less likely
to occur. [More info](android-gradle-overview.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Gradle) project and import that into Android
Studio. This is useful if you want more control over the build pipeline, want
to see or modify the [Android App Manifest](android-manifest.html) that Unity
generates for your application, or [integrate Unity-powered features into
another Android application](UnityasaLibrary-Android.html).

## Exporting

To export a Unity project for Android Studio:

  1. Select **File** > **Build Settings**.
  2. From the list of platforms in the **Platform** pane, select **Android**.  
**Note** : If Android is greyed out, [set up your project for Android
development](android-sdksetup.html).

  3. Enable **Export Project**.
  4. Click **Export**.
  5. Select the destination folder and click **Select Folder** to start the export process.

After Unity exports the Gradle project, you can import the Gradle project into
Android Studio. For information on how to do this, refer to [Migrate to
Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/intro/migrate.html). For
information on the file structure of the exported Gradle project, refer to
[Gradle project structure](android-gradle-overview.html#gradle-project-
structure).
