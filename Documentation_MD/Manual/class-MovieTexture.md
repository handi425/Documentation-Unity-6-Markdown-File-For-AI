The Movie Texture **Inspector** A Unity window that displays information about
the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to
inspect and edit the values. [More info](UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Inspector) is similar to the [Texture](class-
TextureImporter.html)An image used when rendering a GameObject, Sprite, or UI
element. Textures are often applied to the surface of a mesh to give it visual
detail. [More info](class-TextureImporter.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#texture) Inspector:

![Video files are Movie Textures in Unity](../uploads/Main/MovieTextureInInspector.png) Video files are Movie Textures in Unity **Property** | **Function**  
---|---  
**Aniso Level** The anisotropic filtering (AF) level of a texture. Allows you
to increase texture quality when viewing a texture at a steep angle. Good for
floor and ground textures. [More info](class-TextureImporter.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#AnisoLevel) | Increases Texture quality when viewing the texture at a steep angle. Good for floor and ground textures  
**Filtering Mode** | Selects how the Texture is filtered when it gets stretched by 3D transformations  
**Loop** | If enabled, the movie will loop when it finishes playing  
**Quality** | **Compression** A method of storing data that reduces the amount of storage space it requires. See [Texture Compression](class-TextureImporterOverride), [Animation Compression](class-AnimationClip.html#AssetProperties), [Audio Compression](class-AudioClip.html), [Build Compression](ReducingFilesize.html).  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#compression) of the Ogg Theora video file. A
higher value means higher quality, but larger file size
