# Animation window

Use the Animation window to preview, create, and modify animation clips
assigned to a **GameObject** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can
represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A
GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More
info](class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject). You can also use the Animation
window to add Animation Events to an **animation clip** Animation data that
can be used for animated characters or simple animations. It is a simple
“unit” piece of motion, such as (one specific instance of) “Idle”, “Walk” or
“Run”. [More info](class-AnimationClip.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#AnimationClip). An **Animation Event** Allows
you to add data to an imported clip which determines when certain actions
should occur in time with the animation. For example, for an animated
character you might want to add events to walk and run cycles to indicate when
the footstep sounds should play. [More
info](AnimationEventsOnImportedClips.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#AnimationEvent) calls a function at a specific
time.
