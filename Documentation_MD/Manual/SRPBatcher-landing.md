Scriptable Render Pipeline Batcher in URP

# Scriptable Render Pipeline (SRP) Batcher in URP

Resources for using the Scriptable **Render Pipeline** A series of operations
that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets
you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. [More
info](render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) (SRP) Batcher to reduce the
number of render state changes between draw calls.

**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Introduction to the SRP Batcher](SRPBatcher.html) | Understand how the SRP Batcher reduces render state changes between draw calls.  
[Check whether a GameObject is compatible with the SRP Batcher](SRPBatcher-Materials.html) | Find out if Unity can include a **GameObject** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject) and a **shader** A program that
runs on the GPU. [More info](Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Shader) in the SRP Batcher.  
[Enable the SRP Batcher](SRPBatcher-Enable.html) | Enable the SRP Batcher in the URP Asset.  
[Troubleshoot the SRP Batcher](SRPBatcher-Profile.html) | Use the Frame Debugger to solve common issues with the SRP Batcher, such as a low number of draw calls in batches.  
[Remove SRP Batcher compatibility for GameObjects](SRPBatcher-Incompatible.html) | Make a shader or renderer incompatible with the SRP Batcher, for example if you want to use [GPU instancing](GPUInstancing.html).
