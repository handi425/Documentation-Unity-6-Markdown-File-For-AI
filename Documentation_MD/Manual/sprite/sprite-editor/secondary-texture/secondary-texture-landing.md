Add a secondary texture

# Sprite editor secondary textures

The **Sprite** A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites
are essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for
combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during
development. [More info](../../../sprite/sprite-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../../Glossary.html#Sprite) Editor’s **Secondary
Textures** module can associate additional Textures with edited sprites. A
**Shader** A program that runs on the GPU. [More info](../../../Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../../Glossary.html#Shader) can then sample these
secondary Textures to apply additional effects on the Sprite, such as normal
mapping. Secondary Textures are currently only supported by **Sprite
Renderers** A component that lets you display images as Sprites for use in
both 2D and 3D scenes. [More info](../../../sprite/renderer/renderer-
landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../../Glossary.html#SpriteRenderer) and are not available
for other Renderer components.
