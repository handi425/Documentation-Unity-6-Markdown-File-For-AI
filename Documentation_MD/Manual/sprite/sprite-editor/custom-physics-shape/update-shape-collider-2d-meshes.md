# Update the shape of the collider 2D meshes

If you have edited the outline of a **Sprite** A 2D graphic objects. If you
are used to working in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard textures but
there are special techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for
efficiency and convenience during development. [More

See in [Glossary](../../../Glossary.html#Sprite) that existing **GameObjects**
The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props,
