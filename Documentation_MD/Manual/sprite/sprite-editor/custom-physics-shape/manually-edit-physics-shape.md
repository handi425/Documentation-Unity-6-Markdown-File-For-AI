# Manually edit the physics shape

You can create your own custom physics shape and edit it in two ways. The
first way is by automatically [generating](generate-physics-shape.html) an
outline, and then moving the control points of the generated outline to
further refine it. Alternatively, click and drag over any space in the Custom
Physics Shape editor window to create a rectangular outline with four control
points and begin refining the outline by moving the control points or adding
and removing them.
