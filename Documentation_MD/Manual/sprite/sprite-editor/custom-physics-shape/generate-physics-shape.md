# Generate the physics shape

To have Unity automatically generate a physics shape that follows the shape of
the original **Sprite** A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in
3D, Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special
techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and
convenience during development. [More info](../../../sprite/sprite-
landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../../Glossary.html#Sprite) texture, and that also takes
into account transparent areas in the texture;

  1. Click the **Generate** button.

However, you can adjust how tightly the generated physics shape follows the
Sprite texture by adjusting the **Outline Tolerance** slider.

  2. Adjust the **Outline Tolerance** slider to refine the outline of the physics shape that Unity generates.

Increasing the value increases how closely the outline follows the shape of
the Sprite texture. Leaving the slider at 0 generates a physics shape that
more loosely follows the Sprite texture.

  3. After adjusting the Outline Tolerance value, to have Unity automatically generate the physics shape based on the slider settings, click **Generate**.

If you adjust the slider value after generating an outline, to regenerate the
outline based on the updated slider value, click **Generate** again.
