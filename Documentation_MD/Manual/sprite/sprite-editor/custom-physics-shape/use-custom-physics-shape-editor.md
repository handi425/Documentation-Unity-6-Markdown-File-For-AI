# Use the Custom Physics Shape editor

The Custom Physics Shape editor provides various functions to allow you to
create or generate the physics shape of the **Sprite** A 2D graphic objects.
If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard
textures but there are special techniques for combining and managing sprite
textures for efficiency and convenience during development. [More
info](../../../sprite/sprite-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../../Glossary.html#Sprite). There are two ways to create
a custom physics shape: have Unity automatically [generate](generate-physics-
shape.html) the shape, or [manually create and edit](manually-edit-physics-
shape.html) it in the editor window.
