# Custom physics shape

Use the [Sprite Editor’s](../sprite-editor-landing.html) Custom Physics Shape
module to edit a **Sprite** A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working
in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special
techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and
convenience during development. [More info](../../../sprite/sprite-
landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../../Glossary.html#Sprite)’s Physics Shape, which
defines the initial shape of the Sprite’s [Collider
2D](../../../2d-physics/collider/collider-2d-landing.html) **Mesh** The main
graphics primitive of Unity. Meshes make up a large part of your 3D worlds.
Unity supports triangulated or Quadrangulated polygon meshes. Nurbs, Nurms,
Subdiv surfaces must be converted to polygons. [More info](../../../mesh.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../../Glossary.html#Mesh). You can further refine the
Physics Shape through the **Collider** An invisible shape that is used to
handle physical collisions for an object. A collider doesn’t need to be
exactly the same shape as the object’s mesh - a rough approximation is often
more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay. [More
info](../../../CollidersOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../../Glossary.html#Collider)’s component settings.

**Topic** | **Description**  
---|---  
[**Use the Custom Physics Shape editor**](use-custom-physics-shape-editor.html) | Have Unity automatically generate the shape, or manually create and edit it in the editor window.  
[**Open the Custom Physics Shape editor**](open-custom-physics-shape-editor.html) | Open the Custom Physics Shape editor to edit shapes.  
[**Generate the physics shape**](generate-physics-shape.html) | Automatically generate a physics shape for a sprite and refine it.  
[**Manually edit the physics shape**](manually-edit-physics-shape.html) | Manually draw and refine a rectangular outline.  
[**Move a control point**](move-control-point.html) | Adjust the Mesh outline by dragging control points.  
[**Add or remove control points**](add-remove-control-points.html) | Manipulate points along the outline of a mesh to adjust the shape.  
[**Move edges**](move-edges.html) | Edit the shape of the mesh by moving the lines connecting its control points.  
[**Work with multiple outlines**](work-multiple-outlines.html) | Create new rectangular outlines for specific **collision** A collision occurs when the physics engine detects that the colliders of two GameObjects make contact or overlap, when at least one has a Rigidbody component and is in motion.
