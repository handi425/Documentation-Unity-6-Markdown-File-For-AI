# Generate the outline

To have Unity automatically generate an outline that follows the shape of the
original **Sprite** A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D,
Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special
techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and
convenience during development. [More info](../../../sprite/sprite-
landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../../Glossary.html#Sprite) texture, and that also takes
into account transparent areas in the texture, click the **Generate** button.
However, you can adjust how tightly the generated outline follows the Sprite
texture by adjusting the **Outline Tolerance** slider.

Adjust the **Outline Tolerance** slider to refine the outline of the **Mesh**
The main graphics primitive of Unity. Meshes make up a large part of your 3D
worlds. Unity supports triangulated or Quadrangulated polygon meshes. Nurbs,
Nurms, Subdiv surfaces must be converted to polygons. [More
info](../../../mesh.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../../Glossary.html#Mesh) that Unity generates.
Increasing the value increases how closely the outline follows the shape of
the Sprite texture. Leaving the slider at 0 generates a Mesh that more loosely
follows the Sprite texture.
