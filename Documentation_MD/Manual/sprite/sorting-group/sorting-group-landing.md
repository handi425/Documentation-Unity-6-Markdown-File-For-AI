Set up a sorting group

# Sorting groups

**Sorting Groups** allow you to group **GameObjects** The fundamental object
in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras,
waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components
attached to it. [More info](../../class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#GameObject) with [Sprite
Renderers](../renderer/renderer-landing.html)A component that lets you display
images as Sprites for use in both 2D and 3D scenes. [More
info](../../sprite/renderer/renderer-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#SpriteRenderer) together, and control
the order in which they render their sprites. Unity renders **Sprite** A 2D
graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are essentially
just standard textures but there are special techniques for combining and
managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during development.
[More info](../../sprite/sprite-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#Sprite) Renderers in the same Sorting
Group together, as if they are a single GameObject.
