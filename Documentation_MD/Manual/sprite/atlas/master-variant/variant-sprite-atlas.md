Create a variant Sprite Atlas

# Variant Sprite Atlas

A [Variant Sprite Atlas](master-variant-sprite-atlases.html) is a type of
****Sprite** A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites
are essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for
combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during
development. [More info](../../../sprite/sprite-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../../Glossary.html#Sprite) Atlas** that does not contain
its own list of selected Textures as it has no **Objects for Packing** list in
its properties. Instead, it receives a copy of the content from the **Sprite
Atlas** A utility that packs several sprite textures tightly together within a
single texture known as an atlas. [More
info](../../../sprite/atlas/v2/v2-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../../Glossary.html#SpriteAtlas) set as its **Master
Atlas**.

Variant Sprite Atlases are an optional step in the [Sprite Atlas
Workflow](../workflow/sprite-atlas-workflow.html). Their main purpose is to
create a variation of another Sprite Atlas’ Textures but with a different
[scaled](scale-textures-variant-sprite-atlas.html) resolution.
