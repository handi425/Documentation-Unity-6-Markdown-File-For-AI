Prepare Sprite Atlases for distribution

# Distribution

To prepare **Sprite** A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D,
Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special
techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and
convenience during development. [More info](../../../sprite/sprite-
landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../../Glossary.html#Sprite) Atlases for distribution,
ensure the source texture is uncompressed, manage build inclusion, use late
binding for performance, and handle sprite requests and creation at runtime
while resolving atlas interactions based on their inclusion or exclusion in
the build.

**Topic** | **Description**  
---|---  
[**Prepare Sprite Atlases for distribution**](prepare-sprite-atlases-distribution.html) | Ensure the source texture is uncompressed and manage how the Atlas is loaded.  
[**Methods of distribution**](methods-distribution.html) | Place Sprite Atlases in the build’s Resources folder or as downloadable AssetBundles.  
[**Late binding**](late-binding.html) | Enhance performance by loading or swapping in Sprite Atlases of different resolutions at runtime.  
[**Load a Sprite Atlas with SpriteAtlasManager.atlasRequested**](load-sprite-atlas-spriteatlasmanageratlasrequested.html) | Manually load the **Sprite Atlas** A utility that packs several sprite textures tightly together within a single texture known as an atlas. [More info](../../../sprite/atlas/v2/v2-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../../Glossary.html#SpriteAtlas) using late binding and
send the sprite to the Unity Editor.  
[**Retrieve sprite contents at runtime with GetSprites**](retrieve-sprite-contents-runtime-getsprites.html) | Create sprites from a Sprite Atlas at runtime.  
[**Resolve different Sprite Atlas scenarios**](resolve-different-sprite-atlas-scenarios.html) | Resolve sprite and Sprite Atlas interactions based on various conditions.
