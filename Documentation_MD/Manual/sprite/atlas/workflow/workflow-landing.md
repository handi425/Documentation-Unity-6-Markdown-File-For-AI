Create a sprite Atlas workflow

# Sprite Atlas workflow

Create a **Sprite** A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D,
Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special
techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and
convenience during development. [More info](../../../sprite/sprite-
landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../../Glossary.html#Sprite) Atlas asset, select objects
for packing, create variants, manage build inclusion, and optimize performance
by organizing sprites efficiently and adjusting texture sizes.

[**Sprite Atlas workflow**](sprite-atlas-workflow.html) | Create a **Sprite Atlas** A utility that packs several sprite textures tightly together within a single texture known as an atlas. [More info](../../../sprite/atlas/v2/v2-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../../Glossary.html#SpriteAtlas) asset, select objects,
optimize for performance, etc.  
[**Create a Sprite Atlas Asset**](create-sprite-atlas-asset.html) | Create a Sprite Atlas asset in the Asset folder.  
[**Select items for the Objects for Packing list**](select-items-objects-packing-list.html) | Add Texture2D and Sprite assets to the Objects for Packing list, or drag and drop a folder.  
[**Include in build**](include-build.html) | By default, Sprite Atlases are included and automatically loaded at runtime.  
[**Optimize Sprite Atlas usage and size for improved performance**](optimize-sprite-atlas-usage-size-improved-performance.html) | Split textures into smaller atlases, reduce empty space in the atlas, etc.
