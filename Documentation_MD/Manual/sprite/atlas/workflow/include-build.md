# Include in build

All **Sprite** A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites
are essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for
combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during
development. [More info](../../../sprite/sprite-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../../Glossary.html#Sprite) Atlases have **Include in
Build** enabled by default when created. This means that Unity includes the
Sprite Atlases with the Project’s [build](../../../PublishingBuilds.html)The
process of compiling your project into a format that is ready to run on a
specific platform or platforms. [More info](../../../BuildSettings.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../../Glossary.html#build) and automatically loads them
at the build’s run time. Enable or disable the ‘Include in Build’ property to
control which Sprite Atlases are included in the Project build.

Clearing ‘Include in Build’ disables this behavior, and is done when preparing
a **Sprite Atlas** A utility that packs several sprite textures tightly
together within a single texture known as an atlas. [More
info](../../../sprite/atlas/v2/v2-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../../Glossary.html#SpriteAtlas) for
[distribution](../distribution/distribution-landing.html).
