Sprite Atlas V2

# Sprite Atlas V2

Sprite Atlas V2, enabled by default in Unity 2022.2+, automatically migrates
V1 assets (which become incompatible with V1), offers flexible texture source
options for sprites in Edit and Play modes, and features an unchanged
**Inspector** A Unity window that displays information about the currently
selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and
edit the values. [More info](../../../UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../../Glossary.html#Inspector) with the imported
**Sprite** A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are
essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for
combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during
development. [More info](../../../sprite/sprite-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../../Glossary.html#Sprite) Atlas object now located at
the bottom.

**Topic** | **Description**  
---|---  
[**Sprite Atlas V2**](sprite-atlas-v2.html) | **Sprite Atlas** A utility that packs several sprite textures tightly together within a single texture known as an atlas. [More info](../../../sprite/atlas/v2/v2-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../../Glossary.html#SpriteAtlas) V2 enhances the
efficiency of sprite management and offers more control over how and when
sprites are packed into atlases.  
[**Enable Sprite Atlas V2**](enable-sprite-atlas-v2.html) | Sprite Atlas V2 is enabled by default in Unity 2022.2+.  
[**Enable Sprite Atlas V2 effects**](enable-sprite-atlas-v2-effects.html) | Select whether sprites always use the Sprite Atlas as their texture source in both Edit and Play modes or only use the Sprite Atlas during builds.  
[**Sprite Atlas V2 inspector reference**](sprite-atlas-v2-inspector-reference.html) | In Sprite Atlas V2, the Inspector properties remain the same as in V1, except that the imported Sprite Atlas object is now located at the bottom of the Inspector.
