# Sprite Atlas V2

The original version 1 of the **Sprite** A 2D graphic objects. If you are used
to working in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are
special techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency
and convenience during development. [More info](../../../sprite/sprite-
landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../../Glossary.html#Sprite) Atlas system packs textures
(from sprites, sprites within textures, and sprites in folders) into an Atlas
Texture. It packs these textures when it enters Play mode, or when it builds
the Player or an AssetBundle. [AssetDatabase V1](../../../AssetDatabase.html)
can’t have dependencies, and has no importer support for named objects, so
Unity packs its Sprite Atlases through a custom mechanism and stores the
output data of textures and render data in the `Library/AtlasCache` folder.

**Note:** From Unity 2022.2 onwards, the Editor’s **Sprite Atlas** A utility
that packs several sprite textures tightly together within a single texture
known as an atlas. [More info](../../../sprite/atlas/v2/v2-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../../Glossary.html#SpriteAtlas) **Mode** is set to
**Sprite Atlas V2 - Enabled** by default. Sprite Atlas V2 uses the
functionalities exposed by [AssetDatabase
V2](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.3/Documentation/Manual/AssetDatabase.html)
(ADBV2) such as [Cache Server](../../../UnityAccelerator.html) support, which
the original Sprite Atlas system didn’t support.
