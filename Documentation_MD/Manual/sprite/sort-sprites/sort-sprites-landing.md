Sort sprites

# Sprites sorting order

Unity sorts renderers by several criteria, such as their Layer order or their
distance from the **Camera** A component which creates an image of a
particular viewpoint in your scene. The output is either drawn to the screen
or captured as a texture. [More info](../../CamerasOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#Camera).

**Topic** | **Description**  
---|---  
[**Sort sprites**](sort-sprites.html) | Sort **sprites** A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during development. [More info](../../sprite/sprite-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#Sprite) based on their position relative
to the camera.  
[**Sort sprites using scripts**](sort-sprites-using-scripts.html) | Sort sprites per camera using **scripts** A piece of code that allows you to create your own Components, trigger game events, modify Component properties over time and respond to user input in any way you like. [More info](../../creating-scripts.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#Scripts).  
[**Sprites sorting reference**](sprites-sorting-reference.html) | Sort sprites with transparency sort mode options.
