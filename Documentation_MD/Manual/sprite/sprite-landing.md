Image import as sprites

# Sprites

Sprites are a type of 2D [asset](../AssetWorkflow.html)Any media or data that
can be used in your game or project. An asset may come from a file created
outside of Unity, such as a 3D Model, an audio file or an image. You can also
create some asset types in Unity, such as an Animator Controller, an Audio
Mixer or a Render Texture. [More info](../AssetWorkflow.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Asset) you can use in your Unity project.
Use this section to learn how to set up your **sprites** A 2D graphic objects.
If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard
textures but there are special techniques for combining and managing sprite
textures for efficiency and convenience during development. [More
info](../sprite/sprite-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](../Glossary.html#Sprite) and manage them with different
components.

If you’re used to working in 3D, sprites are similar to standard textures but
there are special techniques to combine and manage sprite textures for
efficiency during development.

**Important:** You must have the [2D Sprite](com.unity.2d.sprite.html) package
installed to have the following features. This package is part of the [2D
feature set](../2DFeature.html) and is automatically installed if you select
the [2D template](https://docs.unity3d.com/hub/manual/Templates.html) when
creating a new project. You can also manually install this package via
[Unity’s Package Manager](../Packages.html).
