# Change the color of a sprite

The image below demonstrates the effect of changing the RGB values on the
****Sprite** A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites
are essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for
combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during
development. [More info](../../sprite/sprite-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#Sprite) Renderer’s** Color setting. To
change a Sprite’s opacity, change the value of its Color property’s Alpha (A)
channel.
