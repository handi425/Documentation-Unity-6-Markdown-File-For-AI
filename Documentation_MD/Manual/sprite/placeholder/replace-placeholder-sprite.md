# Replace the placeholder sprite

To change your placeholder **sprite** A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to
working in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are
special techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency
and convenience during development. [More info](../../sprite/sprite-
landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#Sprite):

  1. Click on it in the ****Scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](../../CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#Scene) View** and then edit via the
****Sprite Renderer** A component that lets you display images as Sprites for
use in both 2D and 3D scenes. [More info](../../sprite/renderer/renderer-
landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#SpriteRenderer) Component** in the
****Inspector** A Unity window that displays information about the currently
selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and
edit the values. [More info](../../UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#Inspector)**.

  2. Replace your sprite via the Sprite Renderer Component in the Inspector tool.

  3. Edit the **Sprite** field.

You can click on the small circle to the right of the input field to bring up
the **Sprite Selector** where you can browse and select from a menu of
available 2D graphic assets.
