# Placeholder sprites

Use the the **Sprite** A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D,
Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special
techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and
convenience during development. [More info](../../sprite/sprite-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#Sprite) Creator to create temporary
placeholder **sprite** (2D) graphics. You can use these in your project during
development and then replace them with the graphics you want to use.

**Topic** | **Description**  
---|---  
[**Access the Sprite Creator**](access-sprite-creator.html) | Choose the placeholder shape in the Sprite Creator.  
[**Replace the placeholder sprite**](replace-placeholder-sprite.html) | Choose a new 2D graphic asset from the **Sprite Renderer** A component that lets you display images as Sprites for use in both 2D and 3D scenes. [More info](../../sprite/renderer/renderer-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#SpriteRenderer) Component in the
**Inspector** A Unity window that displays information about the currently
selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and
edit the values. [More info](../../UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#Inspector).  
[**Use the placeholder sprite**](use-placeholder-sprite.html) | Replace the placeholder sprite with the actual sprite.  
  
## Prerequisites

You must have the [2D Sprite package](com.unity.2d.sprite.html) to have the
different **Sprite** options in the **Assets** menu. This package is part of
the [2D feature set](../../2DFeature.html) and are automatically installed if
you select the **2D** project template when creating a new project.

## Details

  * The Sprite Creator makes 4x4 white PNG outline textures.
  * The placeholder sprites are perfect primitive polygons (e.g. triangle, hexagon, n-sided polygon), generated by algorithm.
  * **NOTE:** Placeholder sprites are not like 3D primitives: A sprite is an asset, and as a many-sided polygon, may represent many different shapes, so placeholder sprites are not built like 3D primitives.
