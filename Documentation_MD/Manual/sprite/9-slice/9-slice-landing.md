9-slicing

# Various image sizes without multiple assets

Reuse an image at various sizes without multiple assets.

Discover the 9-slicing method, set up your **sprites** A 2D graphic objects.
If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard
textures but there are special techniques for combining and managing sprite
textures for efficiency and convenience during development. [More
info](../../sprite/sprite-landing.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#Sprite) for 9-slicing, then 9-slice
them.

**Topic** | **Description**  
---|---  
**[9-slicing](9-slicing.html)** | Divide an image into nine sections for flexible resizing while maintaining proportions.  
**[Set up your sprite for 9-slicing](set-sprite-9slicing.html)** | Set up the image in the **Inspector** A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. [More info](../../UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#Inspector) and the sprite editor.  
**[9-slice your sprite](9-slice-sprite.html)** | Ensure the Sprite and its **Collider** An invisible shape that is used to handle physical collisions for an object. A collider doesn’t need to be exactly the same shape as the object’s mesh - a rough approximation is often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay. [More info](../../CollidersOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](../../Glossary.html#Collider) adjust correctly when resized.
