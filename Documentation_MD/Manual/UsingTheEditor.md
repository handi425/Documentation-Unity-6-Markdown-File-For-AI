This section provides a detailed tour of the most common editor windows, and
how to make full use of them.

![The most common windows in their default positions](../uploads/Main/using-
editor-window.png) The most common windows in their default positions

  * **(A)** [The Toolbar](Toolbar.html) provides access to your Unity Account and Unity Cloud Services. It also contains controls for Play mode; Undo history; [Unity Search](search-overview.html); a layer visibility menu; and the Editor layout menu.
  * **(B)** [The Hierarchy window](Hierarchy.html) is a hierarchical text representation of every **GameObject** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject) in the **Scene** A Scene contains
the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a
unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and
decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More
info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene). Each item in the Scene has an entry in
the hierarchy, so the two windows are inherently linked. The hierarchy reveals
the structure of how GameObjects attach to each other.

  * **(C)** [The Game view](GameView.html) simulates what your final rendered game will look like through your Scene **Cameras** A component which creates an image of a particular viewpoint in your scene. The output is either drawn to the screen or captured as a texture. [More info](CamerasOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Camera). When you click the Play button, the
simulation begins.

  * **(D)** [The Scene view](UsingTheSceneView.html) allows you to visually navigate and edit your Scene. The **Scene view** An interactive view into the world you are creating. You use the Scene View to select and position scenery, characters, cameras, lights, and all other types of Game Object. [More info](UsingTheSceneView.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#SceneView) can display a 3D or 2D perspective,
depending on the type of Project you are working on.

  * **(E)** [Overlays](overlays.html) contain the basic tools for manipulating the Scene view and the GameObjects within it. You can also add custom Overlays to improve your workflow.
  * **(F)** [The Inspector window](UsingTheInspector.html) allows you to view and edit all the properties of the currently selected GameObject. Because different types of GameObjects have different sets of properties, the layout and contents of the **Inspector** A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. [More info](UsingTheInspector.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Inspector) window change each time you select
a different GameObject.

  * **(G)** [The Project window](ProjectView.html) displays your library of Assets that are available to use in your Project. When you import Assets into your Project, they appear here.
  * **(H)** [The status bar](StatusBar.html) provides notifications about various Unity processes, and quick access to related tools and settings.
