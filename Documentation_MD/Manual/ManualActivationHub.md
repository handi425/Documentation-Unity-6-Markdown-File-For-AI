# Submit a license request from the Hub

Submit a license request from the Unity Hub to manually activate your license
if you’re unable to use the [other activation
methods](LicenseActivationMethods.html).

Note: The manual activation method works only with plans other than Unity
Personal.  
---  
  
Although you can submit a license request from the computer where you plan to
use Unity, the following procedure shows a workaround if that computer can’t
connect to the internet. The following procedure assumes you have access to
two computers, as follows:

  * The first computer is the computer where you installed Unity, but the computer can’t connect to the internet.
  * The second computer is any computer that can connect to the internet.

## Procedure

  1. On the first computer, open the Unity Hub. 

  2. Open the Preferences menu: ![](../uploads/Main/hubPref.png)

  3. Select **Licenses** from the side menu.

  4. Select **Add**.

  5. Select **Activate with license request**.

  6. Follow the **Download license request** step on-screen. This step creates an `.alf` file on the first computer. Don’t close the Unity Hub, since you’ll be returning to it in a later step.

  7. Copy the `.alf` file from the previous step to a second computer that has internet access.

  8. Use the second computer to go to [license.unity3d.com/manual](https://license.unity3d.com/manual) and follow the instructions there. This step generates a `.ulf` file. If you experience issues accessing the website:

     * Go to [id.unity.com](https://id.unity.com/) and make sure you’re signed in to your Unity ID. You need a valid login to request a Unity license file.
     * Try pasting `https://license.unity3d.com/manual` into your browser’s address bar.
  9. Copy the `.ulf` license file from the second computer to the first computer.

  10. From the first computer, follow Unity Hub’s **Activate with license file** on-screen. This step doesn’t need internet access.

After completing the process, you can view your active license in the Hub by
opening the Preferences menu (![](../uploads/Main/hubPref.png)) and selecting
**Licenses**.
