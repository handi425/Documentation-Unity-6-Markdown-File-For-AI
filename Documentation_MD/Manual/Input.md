# Input

**Input** in Unity refers to users sending signals from the outside world to
your game or app using a physical device.

Unity supports input from many types of device, such as gamepads, mouse,
keyboard, touchscreen, joystick, movement-sensors like accelerometers or
gyroscopes, and **VR** Virtual Reality [More info](VROverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#VR) and **AR** Augmented Reality [More
info](AROverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#AR) controllers. Almost every project requires
input of some kind, whether it is to allow users to navigate a **UI**(User
Interface) Allows a user to interact with your application. Unity currently
supports three UI systems. [More info](UI-system-compare.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#UI), control a character in a game, or move
around and interact with objects in **virtual reality** Virtual Reality (VR)
immerses users in an artificial 3D world of realistic images and sounds, using
a headset and motion tracking. [More info](VROverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#VirtualReality).

Unity has two methods of implementing Input:

  * The **Input System Package** , which is newer, more flexible, and better supported.
  * The legacy ****Input Manager** Settings where you can define all the different input axes, buttons and controls for your project. [More info](class-InputManager.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#InputManager)** (which includes the built-in
`Input` class).

## The Input System Package

Unity’s best support for input is provided by the [Input System
Package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@latest),
which you install using the [Package Manager](Packages.md).

This is the recommended solution for most projects. It provides an intuitive
interface in the Editor to configure input, and provides a variety of
workflows to suit your project and coding style.

Get started with the [Input System
Package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@latest).

## Legacy projects

If you are supporting a legacy project or you need to use the older “Input
Manager” for any other reason, see the [legacy Input Manager
documentation](InputLegacy.html).
