Introduction to dynamic batching

# Batching moving GameObjects

Resources for combining moving **GameObjects** The fundamental object in Unity
scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints,
and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached
to it. [More info](class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject) into fewer draw calls.

**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Introduction to dynamic batching](dynamic-batching.html) | Understand how Unity combines dynamic GameObjects, and its limitations.  
[How Unity batches moving GameObjects](dynamic-batching-meshes.html) | Learn how Unity combines meshes and dynamic meshes into a single draw call.  
[Enable dynamic batching](dynamic-batching-enable.html) | Enable Unity performing **static batching** A technique Unity uses to draw GameObjects on the screen that combines static (non-moving) GameObjects into big Meshes, and renders them in a faster way. [More info](DrawCallBatching.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#StaticBatching) at build time or at runtime.
