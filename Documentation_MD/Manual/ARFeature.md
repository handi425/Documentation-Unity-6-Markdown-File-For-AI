# AR feature set

Unity provides powerful **AR** Augmented Reality [More info](AROverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#AR) tools to create rich, deeply engaging
**augmented reality** Augmented Reality (AR) uses computer graphics or video
composited on top of a live video feed to augment the view and create
interaction with real and virtual objects. [More info](AROverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#AugmentedReality) experiences that
intelligently interact with the real world. Unity’s AR **feature set** A
feature set is a collection of related packages that you can use to achieve
specific results in the Unity Editor. You can manage feature sets directly in
Unity’s Package Manager. [More info](FeatureSets.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Featureset) provides a starting point for
augmented reality development, spanning from head-mounted displays to mobile.

## Getting started

Unity’s AR feature set pre-installs the correct packages needed for AR
development for the following AR platforms and devices:

  * [Google ARCore](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/unity)
  * [Apple ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/)
  * [Hololens via OpenXR](com.unity.xr.openxr.html)
  * [Magic Leap 2](https://developer-docs.magicleap.cloud/docs/guides/unity/getting-started/unity-getting-started)

For more information on how to start developing applications for these
platforms in Unity, see the documentation in the list above.
