# Scene view context menu

Use the **Scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game.
Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place
your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and
building your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene) view context menu to access common
**Scene view** An interactive view into the world you are creating. You use
the Scene View to select and position scenery, characters, cameras, lights,
and all other types of Game Object. [More info](UsingTheSceneView.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#SceneView) actions directly in the scene
rather than from the menu **toolbar** A row of buttons and basic controls at
the top of the Unity Editor that allows you to interact with the Editor in
various ways (e.g. scaling, translation). [More info](Toolbar.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Toolbar).

The menu options that display in the Scene view context menu depend on your
current selection and the tool context enabled in the Tools overlay. If you’ve
selected a **GameObject** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can
represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A
GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More
info](class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject), the Scene view context menu
displays options for that GameObject and any relevant attached components.

To display the context menu, right-click in the Scene view.

**Note** : You can select a different shortcut to display the Scene view
context menu in the [Shortcuts Manager](ShortcutsManager.html).

The default tool context in the Scene view is **GameObject**. When the
**GameObject** tool context is enabled, the Scene view context menu displays
the following menu items by default when you select a GameObject:

  * Clipboard actions such as cut, copy, paste, delete, and duplicate.
  * GameObject view options to help you visualize the selected GameObject in the Scene view.
  * The option to [Isolate selected GameObjects](SceneVisibility.html#isolate-selected-gameobjects) in the Scene view so that only the selected GameObject is visible.
  * The option to a add a [component](UsingComponents.html)A functional part of a GameObject. A GameObject can contain any number of components. Unity has many built-in components, and you can create your own by writing scripts that inherit from MonoBehaviour. [More info](UsingComponents.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#component) to the selected GameObject.

  * The option to open the [properties](EditingValueProperties.html) of the selected in GameObject in a new window.
  * The [Prefab](Prefabs.html)An asset type that allows you to store a GameObject complete with components and properties. The prefab acts as a template from which you can create new object instances in the scene. [More info](Prefabs.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Prefab) menu.

  * The [Transform](class-Transform.html) menu.

If the GameObject has additional components attached to it, actions related to
those components display at the end of the Scene view context menu.

If your project contains multiple tool contexts, you can use the first button
in the Tools overlay to select a tool context. If you enable a tool context
that isn’t **GameObject** , the Scene view context menu displays options
relevant to your selection in that tool context. For example, if your project
contains the
[Splines](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.splines@latest) package
and you enable the **Splines** tool context, then the Scene view context menu
displays options to create and edit splines.
