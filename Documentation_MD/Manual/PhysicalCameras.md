# Simulating real-world cameras with Physical Cameras

Resources and techniques for using a Physical **Camera** A component which
creates an image of a particular viewpoint in your scene. The output is either
drawn to the screen or captured as a texture. [More
info](CamerasOverview.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Camera) component, which has the same camera
settings as most 3D modeling applications.

**Page** | **Description**

[Physical Cameras](PhysicalCameras-introduction.html) | Understand how a Physical Camera component simulates real-word cameras, including settings such as focal length and sensor size.  
[Widen the view with Lens Shift](PhysicalCameras-LensShift.html) | Offset the camera lens from its sensor horizontally and vertically, to reposition an object in the frame with little or no distortion.
