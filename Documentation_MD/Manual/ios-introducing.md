# Introducing iOS

[iOS](https://www.apple.com/uk/ios) is the operating system that powers a
variety of Apple’s mobile devices. Unity includes native support for the iOS
platform which means you can use Unity and its tools to create and deliver 2D
and 3D applications for iOS.

Before you begin to develop an iOS application in Unity, familiarize yourself
with the key concepts, requirements, and workflows.

For general information about developing iOS applications, refer to [Apple’s
developer documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/).
