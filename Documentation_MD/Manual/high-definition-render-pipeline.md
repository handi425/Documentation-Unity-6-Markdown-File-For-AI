Using the Built-In Render Pipeline

# Using the High Definition Render Pipeline

The High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) is a prebuilt [Scriptable Render
Pipeline](scriptable-render-pipeline-introduction.html), built by Unity. HDRP
lets you create cutting-edge, high-fidelity graphics for high-end platforms.

![](../uploads/Main/srp-hdr-example.png)

Use HDRP for AAA quality games, automotive demos, architectural applications
and anything that requires high-fidelity graphics. HDRP uses physically-based
lighting and materials, and supports both forward and deferred rendering. HDRP
uses compute **shader** A program that runs on the GPU. [More
info](Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Shader) technology and therefore requires
compatible GPU hardware.

For information on how to use HDRP, see the [HDRP documentation
microsite](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-
definition@latest).
