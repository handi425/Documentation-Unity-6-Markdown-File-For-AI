# Binding system implementation details

The following is an explanation of how the **UI**(User Interface) Allows a
user to interact with your application. Unity currently supports three UI
systems. [More info](UI-system-compare.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#UI) Toolkit binding system works at the
implementation level.

## Binding creation

When you call the `Bind()` method, it synchronizes and tracks the first value
asynchronously. This means that the `value` property of the fields can’t
update immediately. This allows you to set up binding for hierarchies that
aren’t yet added to any UI.

## Change detection

The binding system relies upon the serialized data of Unity objects to
implement change detection.

After you create a binding between a `SerializedObject` and one or more
elements, the system polls this object for changes at a regular interval, but
not every frame, in two steps:

  1. The system serializes and polls the `SerializedObject` in native code to detect any change to serialized bytes. If there are no changes, it stops.
  2. If there are changes, the system compares the property and the displayed value on the bound element. If needed, the system updates the displayed value. It does this for each specific property-to-element binding for the given object.

## Operation throttling

Some binding operations might be too long to handle in a single frame. If the
binding operations are handled in a single frame, the UI might become
unresponsive. To prevent this, these binding operations might happen across
several frames. For example, it might take several updates to detect changes,
depending on the number of objects polled.
