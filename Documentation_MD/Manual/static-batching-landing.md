Introduction to static batching

# Batching static GameObjects

Resources for combining static **GameObjects** The fundamental object in Unity
scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints,
and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached
to it. [More info](class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject) into fewer draw calls.

**Page** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Introduction to static batching](static-batching.html) | Understand how Unity builds a combined **mesh** The main graphics primitive of Unity. Meshes make up a large part of your 3D worlds. Unity supports triangulated or Quadrangulated polygon meshes. Nurbs, Nurms, Subdiv surfaces must be converted to polygons. [More info](mesh.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Mesh), and a shared vertex and index buffer.  
[Enable static batching](static-batching-enable.html) | Enable Unity performing **static batching** A technique Unity uses to draw GameObjects on the screen that combines static (non-moving) GameObjects into big Meshes, and renders them in a faster way. [More info](DrawCallBatching.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#StaticBatching) at build time or at runtime.
