Code examples: Call JavaScript and C/C++/C# functions in Unity

# Interaction with browser scripting

When you build content for the web, you might need to communicate with other
elements on your web page or use Web APIs to implement functionality that
Unity doesn’t expose by default.

In both cases, you need to directly interface with the browser’s JavaScript
engine. Unity Web provides different methods to handle these interactions.

Topic | Description  
---|---  
[Code examples: Call JavaScript and C/C++/C# functions in Unity](web-interacting-code-example.html) | Code examples that show interactions between Unity, JavaScript, and C-based code.  
[Set up your JavaScript plug-in](web-interacting-browser-js.html) | Create a JavaScript **plug-in** A set of code created outside of Unity that creates functionality in Unity. There are two kinds of plug-ins you can use in Unity: Managed plug-ins (managed .NET assemblies created with tools like Visual Studio) and Native plug-ins (platform-specific native code libraries). [More info](./plug-ins.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Plug-in) that your Unity project can interact
with.  
[Call JavaScript functions from Unity C# scripts](web-interacting-browser-js-to-unity.html) | Call functions from your JavaScript plug-in or browser in your Unity project.  
[Call Unity C# script functions from JavaScript](web-interacting-browser-unity-to-js.html) | Call functions from your Unity project in your JavaScript plug-in or browser.  
[Call C/C++/C# functions from Unity C# scripts](web-interacting-browsers-c-to-unity.html) | Call functions from your C or C++ code in your Unity project.  
[Compile a static library as a Unity plug-in](web-interacting-browsers-library.html) | Call functions from a static library.  
[Create callbacks between Unity C#, JavaScript, and C/C++/C# code](web-interacting-browser-example.html) | Learn how to use callbacks to communicate between your plug-in, browser, and Unity project.  
[JavaScript interface in Unity Web builds](web-js-interface.html) | Learn about some useful functions you can use in the JavaScript interface.
