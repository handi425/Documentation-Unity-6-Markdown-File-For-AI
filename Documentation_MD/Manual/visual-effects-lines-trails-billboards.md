# Lines and trails

Unity uses specialized components to configure and render lines, trails, and
**billboards** A textured 2D object that rotates so that it always faces the
Camera. [More info](class-BillboardRenderer.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Billboard).

**Topic** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Rendering lines](rendering-lines.html) | Techniques for rendering individual lines in 3D space, and applying materials to those lines.  
[Rendering trails](rendering-trails.html) | Techniques for rendering trails that appear behind moving **GameObjects** The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. [More info](class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject), and applying materials to those
trails.  
  
## Render pipeline information

How you work with lines and trails depends on the **render pipeline** A series
of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a
screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your
own. [More info](render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Renderpipeline) you use.

**Feature name** | **Universal Render Pipeline (URP)** | **High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP)** | **Built-in Render Pipeline**  
---|---|---|---  
****Line Renderer** A component that takes an array of two or more points in
3D space and draws a straight line between each one. You can use a single Line
Renderer component to draw anything from a simple straight line to a complex
spiral. [More info](class-LineRenderer.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#LineRenderer) component** | Yes. | Yes. | Yes.  
**Trail Renderer component** | Yes.
