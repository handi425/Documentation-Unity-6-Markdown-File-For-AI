# Call native plug-in for Android code

The process to call code in native **plug-ins** A set of code created outside
of Unity that creates functionality in Unity. There are two kinds of plug-ins
you can use in Unity: Managed plug-ins (managed .NET assemblies created with
tools like Visual Studio) and Native plug-ins (platform-specific native code
libraries). [More info](./plug-ins.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Plug-in) for Android is the same as standard
[native plug-ins](plug-ins-native.html)A platform-specific native code library
that is created outside of Unity for use in Unity. Allows you can access
features like OS calls and third-party code libraries that would otherwise not
be available to Unity. [More info](./plug-ins.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Nativeplug-in).

**Note** : If you use individual C/C++ source files as plug-ins, use
`__Internal` as the plug-in name in the
[DllImport](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-
us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.interopservices.dllimportattribute) attribute.

It’s best practice to wrap all native plug-in method calls with an additional
C# code layer that:

  * Checks [Application.platform](../ScriptReference/Application-platform.html) and only calls native methods when the application is running on Android devices using the architecture that you compiled the native plug-in for. On other platforms and architectures, the additional C# code layer should return dummy values.
  * Uses [platform defines](platform-dependent-compilation.html) to control platform dependent code compilation and only compile code that uses the plug-in on platforms that have the plug-in available.

## Sample package

The
[AndroidNativePlugin.unitypackage](../uploads/Examples/AndroidNativePlugin.zip)
zip file contains a simple example of a native code plug-in distributed as a
Unity package.

The sample shows how to invoke C++ code from a Unity application. The package
includes a **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game.
Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place
your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and
building your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene) which displays the sum of two values as
calculated by a native plug-in. To compile the plug-in, use [Android
NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/index.html). For information on how to
install Android NDK via the Unity Hub, see [Android environment
setup](android-sdksetup.html).

To install the sample:

  1. Download the zip file.
  2. Extract the `AndroidNativePlugin.unitypackage` file.
  3. In a Unity project, click **Assets** > **Import Package** > **Custom Package**.
  4. In the **Import Package** file dialog, find and select the extracted `AndroidNativePlugin.unitypackage` file.
