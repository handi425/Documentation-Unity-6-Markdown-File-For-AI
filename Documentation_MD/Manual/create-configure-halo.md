# Create and configure a halo light effect

**Note:** This workflow is compatible only with the Built-in **Render
Pipeline** A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and
displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render
pipelines, or write your own. [More info](render-pipelines.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Renderpipeline). For similar functionality in
other render pipelines, see [Lens flares and halos](visual-effects-lens-
flares.html).

Add a Halo component to a **GameObject** The fundamental object in Unity
scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints,
and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached
to it. [More info](class-GameObject.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#GameObject) with a [Light component](class-
Light.html). Then set its size and color properties to give the desired
glowing effect.

**Note:** A Light can also display a halo without a separate Halo component by
enabling its _Draw Halo_ property, but you cannot configure its size and
color.

To see Halos in the **scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of
your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene,
you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing
and building your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene) view, check **Fx** button in the
**Scene View** An interactive view into the world you are creating. You use
the Scene View to select and position scenery, characters, cameras, lights,
and all other types of Game Object. [More info](UsingTheSceneView.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#SceneView) **Toolbar** A row of buttons and
basic controls at the top of the Unity Editor that allows you to interact with
the Editor in various ways (e.g. scaling, translation). [More
info](Toolbar.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Toolbar).

To override the **shader** A program that runs on the GPU. [More
info](Shaders.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Shader) used for Halos, open the
[Graphics](class-GraphicsSettings.html) window and set **Light Halo** to the
shader that you would like to use as the override.
