# Change the layout of an overlay

You can set an overlay to display in one of the following layouts:

  * **Collapsed** : Displays only the overlay’s icon and a downward facing arrow. Click the arrow to display the content of the overlay. If the overlay has no icon, the icon of the collapsed container is the first two letters of the overlay’s label. You can expand collapsed overlays.
  * **Panel** : Displays all the overlay’s content and its label. You can’t set overlays that are docked to the edges of the **Scene** A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. [More info](CreatingScenes.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scene) view to Panel.

  * **Horizontal** : Displays the overlay’s content in a horizontal container. An overlay set to the Horizontal layout doesn’t display its label.
  * **Vertical** : Displays the overlay’s content in a vertical container. An overlay set to the Vertical layout doesn’t display its label.

Overlays that are not **toolbars** A row of buttons and basic controls at the
top of the Unity Editor that allows you to interact with the Editor in various
ways (e.g. scaling, translation). [More info](Toolbar.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Toolbar), such as the
[Orientation](SceneViewNavigation.html#gizmo) overlay, cannot use the
Horizontal or Vertical layouts.

If you want to save your overlay configuration, refer to [Create and manage
overlay configurations](manage-overlay-configurations.html).

To change the layout of an overlay:

  1. Right-click the handle (**=**) of an overlay.
  2. Select a layout: 
     * If the overlay is not docked to an edge of the **Scene view** An interactive view into the world you are creating. You use the Scene View to select and position scenery, characters, cameras, lights, and all other types of Game Object. [More info](UsingTheSceneView.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#SceneView), you can select any layout.

     * If the overlay is docked to an edge of the Scene view, you can only expand or collapse the overlay.

## Expand a collapsed overlay

Overlays that aren’t toolbars, such as the
[Orientation](SceneViewNavigation.html#gizmo) overlay, collapse when they are
docked to an edge of the Scene view and can’t be expanded.

To expand an overlay, right-click the handle (**=**) of a collapsed overlay
and select **Expand**.
