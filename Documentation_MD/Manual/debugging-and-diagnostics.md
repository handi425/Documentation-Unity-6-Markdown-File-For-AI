Debug C# code in Unity

# Debugging and diagnostics

Unity supports a range of tools for debugging and diagnosing issues in your
project code.

**Topic** | **Description**  
---|---  
[Debug C# code in Unity](./managed-code-debugging.html) | Track down bugs in your **scripts** A piece of code that allows you to create your own Components, trigger game events, modify Component properties over time and respond to user input in any way you like. [More info](creating-scripts.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Scripts) by attaching external debuggers and
stepping through your project code as it executes.  
[The Debug class](class-Debug.html) | Use the [Debug](../ScriptReference/Debug.html) class in your project code to write messages and errors to the **Console window** A Unity Editor window that shows errors, warnings and other messages generated by Unity, or your own scripts. [More info](Console.html)  
See in [Glossary](Glossary.html#Consolewindow).  
[Log files reference](log-files.html) | Locate Unity’s log files which record messages, warnings, and errors that can help you understand the source of problems in your application.  
[Stack trace logging](./stack-trace.html) | Configure the level of stack trace information shown in Unity’s log files and console to help track down problems in your scripts.  
[Roslyn analyzers and source generators](roslyn-analyzers.html) | Use analyzers to inspect your code for style, quality, and other issues.
