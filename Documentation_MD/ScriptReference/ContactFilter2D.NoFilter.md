## Declaration

public [ContactFilter2D](ContactFilter2D.html) NoFilter();

### Returns

**ContactFilter2D** A copy of the contact filter set to not filter any
[ContactPoint2D](ContactPoint2D.html).

### Description

Sets the contact filter to not filter any
[ContactPoint2D](ContactPoint2D.html).

When you are using a function that requires a
[ContactFilter2D](ContactFilter2D.html), but you don't want to perform any
filtering, then use this function to return a
[ContactFilter2D](ContactFilter2D.html) that turns off any filtering.  
  
Call this function to set the contact filter to
[layerMask](ContactFilter2D-layerMask.html) =
[Physics2D.AllLayers](Physics2D.AllLayers.html),
[minDepth](ContactFilter2D-minDepth.html) =
[Mathf.Infinity](Mathf.Infinity.html),
[maxDepth](ContactFilter2D-maxDepth.html) =
[Mathf.Infinity](Mathf.Infinity.html),
[minNormalAngle](ContactFilter2D-minNormalAngle.html) =
[Mathf.Infinity](Mathf.Infinity.html) and
[maxNormalAngle](ContactFilter2D-maxNormalAngle.html) =
[Mathf.Infinity](Mathf.Infinity.html).
