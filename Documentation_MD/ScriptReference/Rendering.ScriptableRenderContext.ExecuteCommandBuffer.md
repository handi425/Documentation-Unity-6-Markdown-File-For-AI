## Declaration

public void
ExecuteCommandBuffer([Rendering.CommandBuffer](Rendering.CommandBuffer.html)
commandBuffer);

### Parameters

commandBuffer | Specifies the Command Buffer to execute.  
---|---  
  
### Description

Schedules the execution of a custom graphics Command Buffer.

During the call to
[ScriptableRenderContext.ExecuteCommandBuffer](Rendering.ScriptableRenderContext.ExecuteCommandBuffer.html),
[ScriptableRenderContext](Rendering.ScriptableRenderContext.html) registers
the commandBuffer parameter into its own internal list of commands to execute.
The actual execution of these commands (including the commands stored in the
custom commandBuffer) happens during
[ScriptableRenderContext.Submit](Rendering.ScriptableRenderContext.Submit.html).  
  
Make sure that you call ExecuteCommandBuffer before other
ScriptableRenderContext methods (such as DrawRenderers, DrawShadows) if your
draw calls depend on a state of the pipeline that you specify in a
CommandBuffer. The code sample below illustrates a case when commands are
submitted in an incorrect order ; followed by a case that behaves as expected:

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.Rendering;  
      
    internal class ExecuteCommandBufferExample
    {
        // TODO: replace with actual settings
        [ScriptableRenderContext](Rendering.ScriptableRenderContext.html) scriptableRenderContext;
        [DrawingSettings](Rendering.DrawingSettings.html) drawingSettings;
        [CullingResults](Rendering.CullingResults.html) cullingResults = new [CullingResults](Rendering.CullingResults.html)();
        [FilteringSettings](Rendering.FilteringSettings.html) filteringSettings = new [FilteringSettings](Rendering.FilteringSettings.html)();  
      
        [Matrix4x4](Matrix4x4.html) myViewMatrix = [Matrix4x4.Scale](Matrix4x4.Scale.html)(new [Vector3](Vector3.html)(2f, 2f, 2f));  
      
        public void DrawRenderersExampleIncorrect()
        {
            [CommandBuffer](Rendering.CommandBuffer.html) myCommandBuffer = new [CommandBuffer](Rendering.CommandBuffer.html)();  
      
            myCommandBuffer.SetViewMatrix(myViewMatrix);  
      
            scriptableRenderContext.DrawRenderers(cullingResults, ref drawingSettings, ref filteringSettings);
            // NO! When scriptableRenderContext submits the DrawRenderers command, it will not know about myViewMatrix :(  
      
            scriptableRenderContext.ExecuteCommandBuffer(myCommandBuffer);
            myCommandBuffer.Clear();
        }  
      
        public void DrawRenderersExampleBetter()
        {
            [CommandBuffer](Rendering.CommandBuffer.html) myCommandBuffer = new [CommandBuffer](Rendering.CommandBuffer.html)();  
      
            myCommandBuffer.SetViewMatrix(myViewMatrix);  
      
            scriptableRenderContext.ExecuteCommandBuffer(myCommandBuffer);
            myCommandBuffer.Clear();  
      
            scriptableRenderContext.DrawRenderers(cullingResults, ref drawingSettings, ref filteringSettings);
            // OK! During next scriptableRenderContext.Submit() call, scriptableRenderContext will set myViewMatrix *before* drawing the renderers.
        }
    }
