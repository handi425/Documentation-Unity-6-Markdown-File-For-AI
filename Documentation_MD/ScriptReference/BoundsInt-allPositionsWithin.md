public [BoundsInt.PositionEnumerator](BoundsInt.PositionEnumerator.html)
allPositionsWithin;

### Description

A BoundsInt.PositionCollection that contains all positions within the
[BoundsInt](BoundsInt.html).

Positions within the BoundsInt are not inclusive of the positions on the upper
limits of the BoundsInt. This iterator will only return positions of size
greater than zero for each axis.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class ExampleScript : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        // Create a [BoundsInt](BoundsInt.html) of a cube with a
        // bottom-left coordinate of (0, 0, 0),
        // and a height, width and depth of 4,
        // and log its contained points to the console.
        void Start()
        {
            // bounds is a cube where every edge has exactly four points.
            // It has 4 * 4 * 4 = 64 points.
            // min = (0,0,0), max = (3,3,3).
            var bounds = new [BoundsInt](BoundsInt.html)(new [Vector3Int](Vector3Int.html)(0, 0, 0), new [Vector3Int](Vector3Int.html)(4, 4, 4));  
      
            // Iterate through each point, and log it to the [Debug](Debug.html) Console.
            foreach (var point in bounds.allPositionsWithin)
            {
                [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)(point.ToString());
            }  
      
            // The 64 unique integer 3-dimensional points that fall within this [Bounds](Bounds.html) will be logged to the [Debug](Debug.html) Console.
        }
    }
