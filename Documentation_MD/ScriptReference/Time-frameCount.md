[ ]()

public static int frameCount;

### Description

The total number of frames since the start of the game (Read Only).

This value starts at 0 and increases by 1 on each
[Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html) phase.  
  
Internally, Unity uses a 64 bit integer which it downcasts to 32 bits when
this is called, and discards the most significant (i.e. top) 32 bits.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        // Makes sure that RecalculateValue only performs
        // some operations once per frame and no more.
        static private int lastRecalculation = -1;  
      
        static void RecalculateValue()
        {
            if (lastRecalculation == [Time.frameCount](Time-frameCount.html))
                return;
            //  ProcessData.AndDoSomeCalculations();
        }
    }
    

**Note:** frameCount starts once all Awake functions have finished. The
frameCount value is undefined during Awake functions.
