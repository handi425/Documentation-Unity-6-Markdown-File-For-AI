### Description

The Stage class represents an editing context which includes a collection of
Scenes.

The main stage contains all the currently open regular Scenes, while a Prefab
stage contains a preview Scene used solely for editing the Prefab in.  
  
The breadcrumbs shown in the Scene view when in Prefab Mode each represent an
individual stage. Those with a Prefab icon represent Prefab stages.  
  
Additional resources: [MainStage](SceneManagement.MainStage.html),
[PreviewSceneStage](SceneManagement.PreviewSceneStage.html).
