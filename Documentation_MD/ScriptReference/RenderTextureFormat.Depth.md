### Description

A depth render texture format.

Depth format is used to render high precision "depth" value into a render
texture. Which format is actually used depends on platform support and on the
number of depth bits you request through the constructor.  
  
You can also set an exact depth-stencil format with
[RenderTexture.depthStencilFormat](RenderTexture-depthStencilFormat.html) or a
[RenderTexture](RenderTexture.html) constructor that takes
[GraphicsFormat](Experimental.Rendering.GraphicsFormat.html). Use
[SystemInfo.IsFormatSupported](SystemInfo.IsFormatSupported.html) to check
your platform supports this.  
  
When writing shaders that use or render into a depth texture, care must be
taken to ensure that they work both on OpenGL and on Direct3D, see [depth
textures documentation](../Manual/SL-CameraDepthTexture.html).  
  
Note that not all graphics cards support depth textures. Use
[SystemInfo.SupportsRenderTextureFormat](SystemInfo.SupportsRenderTextureFormat.html)
to check for support.  
  
Additional resources: [RenderTexture](RenderTexture.html) class,
[SystemInfo.SupportsRenderTextureFormat](SystemInfo.SupportsRenderTextureFormat.html).
