### Description

Freeze motion along the X-axis.

    
    
    //This example shows how [RigidbodyConstraints](RigidbodyConstraints.html) is used to freeze the position and rotation of a [Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html) in the x axis at start-up.
    //It also shows what happens when these constraints are removed, when you press the space key
    //Attach this to a [GameObject](GameObject.html) with a [Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html) to see it in action  
      
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        [Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html) m_Rigidbody;
        [Vector3](Vector3.html) m_XAxis;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            m_Rigidbody = GetComponent<[Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html)>();
            //This locks the RigidBody so that it does not move or rotate in the x axis (can be seen in Inspector).
            m_Rigidbody.constraints = [RigidbodyConstraints.FreezePositionX](RigidbodyConstraints.FreezePositionX.html) | [RigidbodyConstraints.FreezeRotationX](RigidbodyConstraints.FreezeRotationX.html);
            //Set up vector for moving the [Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html) in the x axis
            m_XAxis = new [Vector3](Vector3.html)(5, 0, 0);
        }  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            //Press space to remove the constraints on the RigidBody
            if ([Input.GetKeyDown](Input.GetKeyDown.html)([KeyCode.Space](KeyCode.Space.html)))
            {
                //Remove all constraints
                m_Rigidbody.constraints = [RigidbodyConstraints.None](RigidbodyConstraints.None.html);
            }  
      
            //Press the right arrow key to move positively in the x axis if the constraints are removed
            if ([Input.GetKeyDown](Input.GetKeyDown.html)([KeyCode.RightArrow](KeyCode.RightArrow.html)))
            {
                //If the constraints are removed, the [Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html) moves along the x axis
                //If the constraints are there, no movement occurs
                m_Rigidbody.velocity = m_XAxis;
            }  
      
            //Press the left arrow key to move negatively in the x axis if the constraints are removed
            if ([Input.GetKeyDown](Input.GetKeyDown.html)([KeyCode.LeftArrow](KeyCode.LeftArrow.html)))
            {
                m_Rigidbody.velocity = -m_XAxis;
            }
        }
    }
