### Description

Values that indicate the status of an Android asset pack.

Unity always returns the status value and the error together in
AndroidAssetPackInfo or AndroidAssetPackState objects. Unity returns these
objects via callback methods after you call either
AndroidAssetPacks.DownloadAssetPackAsync or
AndroidAssetPacks.GetAssetPackStateAsync. When the status value is
AndroidAssetPackStatus.Failed or AndroidAssetPackStatus.Unknown, the error
value indicates the cause of the failure. For any other status value, the
error value should always be AndroidAssetPackError.NoError. This enum directly
wraps the
[AssetPackStatus](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/play/core/assetpacks/model/AssetPackStatus)
values in the PlayCore API. Additional resources:
[AndroidAssetPackInfo](Android.AndroidAssetPackInfo.html),
[AndroidAssetPacks.DownloadAssetPackAsync](Android.AndroidAssetPacks.DownloadAssetPackAsync.html),
[AndroidAssetPacks.GetAssetPackStateAsync](Android.AndroidAssetPacks.GetAssetPackStateAsync.html),
[AndroidAssetPackState](Android.AndroidAssetPackState.html).
