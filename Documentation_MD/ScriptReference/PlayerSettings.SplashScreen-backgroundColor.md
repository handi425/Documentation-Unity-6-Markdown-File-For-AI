Component in the Manual")

public static [Color](Color.html) backgroundColor;

### Description

Sets the background color of the splash screen when no background image is
used. The default background color is dark blue RGB(34.44,54).

On Android, use this property to set the background color for the static
splash image. In this case, the selected background color blends with the
static splash image based on the image transparency levels. Additionally, on
Android Unity uses this color to hide the default automatic splash screen
which appears on Android 12+ devices. This happens even if
[PlayerSettings.SplashScreen.background](PlayerSettings.SplashScreen-
background.html) is being set. Therefore, make sure that this color is set to
match [PlayerSettings.SplashScreen.background](PlayerSettings.SplashScreen-
background.html) image.
