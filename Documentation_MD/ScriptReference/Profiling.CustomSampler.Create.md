## Declaration

public static [Profiling.CustomSampler](Profiling.CustomSampler.html)
Create(string name, bool collectGpuData);

### Parameters

name | Name of the Sampler.  
---|---  
collectGpuData | Specifies whether this Sampler records GPU timings. If you want the Sampler to record GPU timings, set this to true.  
  
### Returns

**CustomSampler** [CustomSampler](Profiling.CustomSampler.html) object or
_null_ if a built-in Sampler with the same name exists.

### Description

Creates a new CustomSampler for profiling parts of your code.

Multiple calls with the same _name_ parameter return different
[CustomSampler](Profiling.CustomSampler.html) objects which refer to the same
native representation. CustomSampler represents scripting profiler label.  
  
Method throws **ArgumentNullException** when used with _null_ string.

    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        [CustomSampler](Profiling.CustomSampler.html) sampler;
        void Start()
        {
            sampler = [CustomSampler.Create](Profiling.CustomSampler.Create.html)("MyCustomSampler");
        }  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            sampler.Begin();
            // do something that takes a lot of time
            sampler.End();
        }
    }
