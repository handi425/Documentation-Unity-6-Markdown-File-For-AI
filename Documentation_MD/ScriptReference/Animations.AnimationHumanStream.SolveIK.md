## Declaration

public void SolveIK();

### Description

Execute the IK solver.

The humanoid IK solver is executed using the IK goal position, rotation, and
weight currently set in the
[AnimationHumanStream](Animations.AnimationHumanStream.html).

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.Playables;
    using UnityEngine.Animations;  
      
    public struct IKJob : [IAnimationJob](Animations.IAnimationJob.html)
    {
        public [TransformSceneHandle](Animations.TransformSceneHandle.html) effector;
        public [PropertySceneHandle](Animations.PropertySceneHandle.html) positionWeight;
        public [PropertySceneHandle](Animations.PropertySceneHandle.html) rotationWeight;  
      
        public void ProcessRootMotion([AnimationStream](Animations.AnimationStream.html) stream) {}  
      
        public void ProcessAnimation([AnimationStream](Animations.AnimationStream.html) stream)
        {
            [AnimationHumanStream](Animations.AnimationHumanStream.html) humanStream = stream.AsHuman();
            if (effector.IsValid(stream) && positionWeight.IsValid(stream) && rotationWeight.IsValid(stream))
            {
                humanStream.SetGoalPosition([AvatarIKGoal.LeftFoot](AvatarIKGoal.LeftFoot.html), effector.GetPosition(stream));
                humanStream.SetGoalRotation([AvatarIKGoal.LeftFoot](AvatarIKGoal.LeftFoot.html), effector.GetRotation(stream));
                humanStream.SetGoalWeightPosition([AvatarIKGoal.LeftFoot](AvatarIKGoal.LeftFoot.html), positionWeight.GetFloat(stream));
                humanStream.SetGoalWeightRotation([AvatarIKGoal.LeftFoot](AvatarIKGoal.LeftFoot.html), rotationWeight.GetFloat(stream));
            }  
      
            humanStream.SolveIK();
        }
    }
