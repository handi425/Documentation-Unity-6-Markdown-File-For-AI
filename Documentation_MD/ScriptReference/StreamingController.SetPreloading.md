## Declaration

public void SetPreloading(float timeoutSeconds, bool activateCameraOnTimeout,
[Camera](Camera.html) disableCameraCuttingFrom);

### Parameters

timeoutSeconds | Optional timeout before stopping preloading. Set to 0.0f when no timeout is required.  
---|---  
activateCameraOnTimeout | Set to True to activate the connected [Camera](Camera.html) component when timeout expires.  
disableCameraCuttingFrom |  [Camera](Camera.html) to deactivate on timeout (if Camera.activateCameraOnTime is True). This parameter can be null.  
  
### Description

Initiate preloading of streaming data for this camera.

Activate texture streaming at this camera location. This is for preloading
texture mipmaps prior to a [Camera](Camera.html) being activated a short time
later. When the Camera component on the same GameObject becomes enabled,
preloading will be disabled. Preloading can be manually disabled with
[StreamingController.CancelPreloading](StreamingController.CancelPreloading.html)  
  
The function will do nothing if called when the associated Camera is already
enabled.
