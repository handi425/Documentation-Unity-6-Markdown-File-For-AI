## Declaration

public static string
GetPrefabAssetPathOfNearestInstanceRoot([Object](Object.html)
instanceComponentOrGameObject);

### Parameters

instanceComponentOrGameObject | An object in the Prefab instance to get the asset path of.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**string** The asset path.

### Description

Retrieves the asset path of the nearest Prefab instance root the specified
object is part of.

The method will look in the Transform hierarchy for the GameObject or its
nearest ancestor which is the root GameObject of any Prefab instance and
return the asset path of that Prefab Asset.  
  
For a Prefab Variant, the variant is returned, and not its base.  
  
The method returns null if the object is not part of a Prefab instance.
