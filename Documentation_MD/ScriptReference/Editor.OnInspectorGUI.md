## Declaration

public void OnInspectorGUI();

### Description

Implement this function to make a custom inspector.

Inside this function you can add your own custom IMGUI based GUI for the
inspector of a specific object class.  
  
**Note:** This function has to be overridden in order to work.  
  
Additional resources:
[Editor.DrawDefaultInspector](Editor.DrawDefaultInspector.html).  
  
The example below shows how a custom label can be created by using `override`:

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);  
      
    // Creates a custom [Label](UIElements.Label.html) on the inspector for all the scripts named ScriptName
    // Make sure you have a ScriptName script in your
    // project, else this will not work.
    [[CustomEditor](CustomEditor.html)(typeof(ScriptName))]
    public class TestOnInspector : [Editor](Editor.html)
    {
        public override void OnInspectorGUI()
        {
            [GUILayout.Label](GUILayout.Label.html) ("This is a [Label](UIElements.Label.html) in a Custom [Editor](Editor.html)");
        }
    }
