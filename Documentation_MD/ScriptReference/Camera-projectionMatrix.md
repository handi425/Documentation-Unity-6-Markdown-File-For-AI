[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-Camera.html "Go to Camera Component in the
Manual")

public [Matrix4x4](Matrix4x4.html) projectionMatrix;

### Description

Set a custom projection matrix.

If you change this matrix, the camera no longer updates its rendering based on
its [fieldOfView](Camera-fieldOfView.html). Moreover, this leaves the camera's
[nearClipPlane](Camera-nearClipPlane.html) and [farClipPlane](Camera-
farClipPlane.html) unchanged, so you need to update those manually to avoid
inconsistencies. This lasts until you call
[ResetProjectionMatrix](Camera.ResetProjectionMatrix.html).  
  
Use a custom projection only if you really need a non-standard projection.
This property is used by Unity's water rendering to setup an _oblique
projection_ matrix. Using custom projections requires good knowledge of
transformation and projection matrices.  
  
Note that projection matrix passed to shaders can be modified depending on
platform and other state. If you need to calculate projection matrix for
shader use from camera's projection, use
[GL.GetGPUProjectionMatrix](GL.GetGPUProjectionMatrix.html).
