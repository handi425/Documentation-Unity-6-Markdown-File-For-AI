public float staticFriction;

### Description

The friction coefficient used when an object is lying on a surface.

Must be greater than or equal to zero. Natural materials will usually have a
friction coefficient between 0 (no friction at all, like slippery ice) and 1
(full friction, like rubber). Values larger than 1 are possible, and may be
realistic for sticky materials.
