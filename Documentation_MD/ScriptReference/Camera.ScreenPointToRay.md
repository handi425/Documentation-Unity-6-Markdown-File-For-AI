[Camera.MonoOrStereoscopicEye](Camera.MonoOrStereoscopicEye.html) eye);

### Parameters

pos | A 3D point, with the x and y coordinates containing a 2D screen space point in pixels. The lower left pixel of the screen is (0,0). The upper right pixel of the screen is (screen width in pixels - 1, screen height in pixels - 1). Unity ignores the z coordinate.  
---|---  
eye | Optional argument that can be used to specify which eye transform to use. Default is Mono.

Resulting ray is in world space, starting on the near plane of the camera and
going through position's (x,y) pixel coordinates on the screen.

    
    
    //Attach this script to your [Camera](Camera.html)
    //This draws a line in the [Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html) view going through a point 200 pixels from the lower-left corner of the screen
    //To see this, enter Play [Mode](Scripting.GarbageCollector.Mode.html) and switch to the **Scene** tab. Zoom into your [Camera](Camera.html)'s position.
