public static bool lightsUseLinearIntensity;

### Description

If this is true, Light intensity is multiplied against linear color values. If
it is false, gamma color values are used.

Light intensity is multiplied by the linear color value when
lightsUseLinearIntensity is enabled. This is physically correct but not the
default for 3D projects created with Unity 5.6 and newer. By default
[lightsUseLinearIntensity](Rendering.GraphicsSettings-
lightsUseLinearIntensity.html) is set to false.  
  
2D projects will have [lightsUseLinearIntensity](Rendering.GraphicsSettings-
lightsUseLinearIntensity.html) set to disabled by default. When disabled, the
gamma color value is multiplied with the intensity. If you want to use
[lightsUseColorTemperature](Rendering.GraphicsSettings-
lightsUseColorTemperature.html),
[lightsUseLinearIntensity](Rendering.GraphicsSettings-
lightsUseLinearIntensity.html) has to be enabled.  
  
If you enable [lightsUseLinearIntensity](Rendering.GraphicsSettings-
lightsUseLinearIntensity.html) on an existing project, all your Lights will
need to be tweaked to regain their original look.  
  
Additional resources:
[GraphicsSettings.lightsUseColorTemperature](Rendering.GraphicsSettings-
lightsUseColorTemperature.html), [Light.colorTemperature](Light-
colorTemperature.html).
