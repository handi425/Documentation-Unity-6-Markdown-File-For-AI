### Description

Contact information for the wheel, reported by
[WheelCollider](WheelCollider.html).

Friction for the [WheelCollider](WheelCollider.html) is computed separately
from the rest of the physics, using a slip based tire friction model. This
allows for more realistic behaviour, but makes wheel colliders ignore standard
[PhysicsMaterial](PhysicsMaterial.html) settings.  
  
The way to simulate different ground materials is to query
[WheelCollider](WheelCollider.html) for its collision information (see
[WheelCollider.GetGroundHit](WheelCollider.GetGroundHit.html)). Usually, you
get the other collider the wheel is hitting, and modify the wheel's
[WheelCollider.forwardFriction](WheelCollider-forwardFriction.html) and
[WheelCollider.sidewaysFriction](WheelCollider-sidewaysFriction.html) based on
the physics material of the ground.  
  
The other members of the WheelHit structure are usually queried for
information purposes or special effects. For example, a "slipping tire" sound
can be played if [forwardSlip](WheelHit-forwardSlip.html) or
[sidewaysSlip](WheelHit-sidewaysSlip.html) exceed some threshold.  
  
Additional resources:
[WheelCollider.GetGroundHit](WheelCollider.GetGroundHit.html).

### Properties

[collider](WheelHit-collider.html)| The other Collider the wheel is hitting.  
---|---  
[force](WheelHit-force.html)| The magnitude of the force being applied for the
contact.  
[forwardDir](WheelHit-forwardDir.html)| The direction the wheel is pointing
in.  
[forwardSlip](WheelHit-forwardSlip.html)| Tire slip in the rolling direction.
Acceleration slip is negative, braking slip is positive.  
[normal](WheelHit-normal.html)| The normal at the point of contact.  
[point](WheelHit-point.html)| The point of contact between the wheel and the
ground.  
[sidewaysDir](WheelHit-sidewaysDir.html)| The sideways direction of the wheel.  
[sidewaysSlip](WheelHit-sidewaysSlip.html)| Tire slip in the sideways
direction.
