public int limitBias;

### Description

The new value to apply on top of the global texture mipmap limit. Can act as
an offset (default) or an override to it.

By default, this is equal to `0`.  
  
If [limitBiasMode](TextureMipmapLimitSettings-limitBiasMode.html) is set to
[TextureMipmapLimitBiasMode.OffsetGlobalLimit](TextureMipmapLimitBiasMode.OffsetGlobalLimit.html),
`limitBias` acts as an offset to the current quality level's
[QualitySettings.globalTextureMipmapLimit](QualitySettings-
globalTextureMipmapLimit.html). For example, if the global texture mipmap
limit is `1` (half size) and `limitBias` is also `1`, the final combined value
for textures that are affected by these settings is `2`. (quarter size)  
  
If [limitBiasMode](TextureMipmapLimitSettings-limitBiasMode.html) is set to
[TextureMipmapLimitBiasMode.OverrideGlobalLimit](TextureMipmapLimitBiasMode.OverrideGlobalLimit.html),
`limitBias` ignores the global texture mipmap limit and acts as an override.
For example, if [QualitySettings.globalTextureMipmapLimit](QualitySettings-
globalTextureMipmapLimit.html) is `2` (quarter size), and `limitBias` is `0`
(full resolution), the final combined value for textures that are affected by
these settings is `0` (full resolution).
