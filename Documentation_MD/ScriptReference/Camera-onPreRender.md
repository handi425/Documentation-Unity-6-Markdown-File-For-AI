[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-Camera.html "Go to Camera Component in the
Manual")

public static [Camera.CameraCallback](Camera.CameraCallback.html) onPreRender;

### Description

Delegate that you can use to execute custom code before a
[Camera](Camera.html) renders the scene.

In the Built-in Render Pipeline, Unity calls this `onPreRender` before any
Camera begins rendering. To execute custom code at this point, create
callbacks that match the signature of
[CameraCallback](Camera.CameraCallback.html), and add them to this delegate.  
  
For similar functionality that applies only to a single Camera and requires
your script to be on the same GameObject, see
[MonoBehaviour.OnPreRender](MonoBehaviour.OnPreRender.html).  
  
If you're using a Scriptable Render Pipeline, for example the Universal Render
Pipeline, use [RenderPipelineManager](Rendering.RenderPipelineManager.html)
instead.  
  
Unity calls `onPreRender` after the Camera performs its culling operation.
This means that if you make a change that affects what the Camera sees, the
change will take effect from the next frame. To make a change to what the
Camera sees in the current frame, use [Camera.onPreCull](Camera-
onPreCull.html).  
  
When Unity calls `onPreRender`, the Camera's render target and depth textures
are not yet set up. If you need to access these, you can execute code later in
the render loop using a [CommandBuffer](Rendering.CommandBuffer.html).

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class CameraCallbackExample : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        // Add your callback to the delegate's invocation list
        void Start()
        {
            [Camera.onPreRender](Camera-onPreRender.html) += OnPreRenderCallback;
        }  
      
        // Unity calls the methods in this delegate's invocation list before rendering any camera
        void OnPreRenderCallback([Camera](Camera.html) cam)
        {
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("[Camera](Camera.html) callback: [Camera](Camera.html) name is " + cam.name);  
      
            // Unity calls this for every active [Camera](Camera.html).
            // If you're only interested in a particular [Camera](Camera.html),
            // check whether the [Camera](Camera.html) is the one you're interested in
            if (cam == [Camera.main](Camera-main.html))
            {
                // Put your custom code here
            }
        }  
      
        // Remove your callback from the delegate's invocation list
        void OnDestroy()
        {
            [Camera.onPreRender](Camera-onPreRender.html) -= OnPreRenderCallback;
        }
    }
