### Description

Binding types deriving from [Binding](UIElements.Binding.html) can implement
this interface to gain an additional layer of data source and data source
path. These will be used by the binding system to compute the final
[BindingContext.dataSource](UIElements.BindingContext-dataSource.html) and
[BindingContext.dataSourcePath](UIElements.BindingContext-dataSourcePath.html)
that will be passed to the [BindingContext](UIElements.BindingContext.html)
during the binding update.

This dataSource and dataSourcePath will only affect the binding itself and not
the hierarchy.

### Properties

[dataSource](UIElements.IDataSourceProvider-dataSource.html)|  Data source
object that is local to the binding object.  
---|---  
[dataSourcePath](UIElements.IDataSourceProvider-dataSourcePath.html)|  Data
source path that is local to the binding object.
