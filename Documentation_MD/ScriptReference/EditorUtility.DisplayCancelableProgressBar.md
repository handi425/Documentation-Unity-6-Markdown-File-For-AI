## Declaration

public static bool DisplayCancelableProgressBar(string title, string info,
float progress);

### Description

Displays or updates a progress bar that has a cancel button.

The window title sets to `title` and the info sets to `info`. Set progress
should to a value between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0 indicates nothing is loaded and
1.0 indicates loading is complete.  
  
This is useful when you perform a long blocking operation in an Editor script,
and want to notify the user of progress. Use this method for long operations
that make the Editor non-responsive. For long operations that happen in the
background, use the [Progress](Progress.html) class instead.  
  
A return value of true indicates that the user pressed the **Cancel** button.
When the return value is true, you must stop the task that is in progress.
After you display the progress bar, use
[EditorUtility.ClearProgressBar](EditorUtility.ClearProgressBar.html) to clear
it.
