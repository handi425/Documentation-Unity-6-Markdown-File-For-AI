LightingSettings Component in the Manual")

**Obsolete** LightingSettings.autoGenerate is obsolete. public bool
autoGenerate;

### Description

Deprecated as Auto Generate lighting is no longer supported. Whether the Unity
Editor automatically precomputes lighting data when the Scene data changes.
(Editor only).

When this is set to `true`, the Editor automatically bakes lightmaps, Light
Probes and Reflection Probes when you make changes to your Scene. When this is
set to `false`, Unity does not automatically bake this data. The default value
is `false`.  
  
When this is set to `false`, you can instruct Unity to perform the bake by
pressing the **Generate Lighting** button in the [Lighting
window](../Manual/lighting-window.html), or by using the
[Lightmapping.Bake](Lightmapping.Bake.html) or
[Lightmapping.BakeAsync](Lightmapping.BakeAsync.html) APIs.  
  
This setting applies to the Baked Global Illumination system and the Enlighten
Realtime Global Illumination system.  
  
When Unity serializes this `LightingSettings` object as a [Lighting Settings
Asset](../Manual/class-LightingSettings.html), this property corresponds to
the **Auto Generate** property in the Lighting Settings Asset Inspector.  
  
Additional resources: [Lighting Settings Asset](../Manual/class-
LightingSettings.html), [Lighting window](../Manual/lighting-window.html),
[Lightmapping.Bake](Lightmapping.Bake.html),
[Lightmapping.BakeAsync](Lightmapping.BakeAsync.html).
