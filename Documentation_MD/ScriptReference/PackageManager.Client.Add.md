Component in the Manual")

## Declaration

public static
[PackageManager.Requests.AddRequest](PackageManager.Requests.AddRequest.html)
Add(string identifier);

### Parameters

identifier | A string representing the package to be added:   
  
\- To install a specific version of a package, use a package identifier
("name@version"). This is the only way to install a [pre-
release](../Manual/pack-preview.html) version.  
\- To install the latest compatible ([released](../Manual/pack-safe.html))
version of a package, specify only the package [name](../Manual/upm-
manifestPkg.html).  
\- To install a git package, specify a [git url](../Manual/upm-git.html).  
\- To install a [local](../Manual/upm-localpath.html) package, specify a value
in the format "file:/path/to/package/folder".  
\- To install a [local tarball](../Manual/upm-localpath.html) package, specify
a value in the format "file:/path/to/package-file.tgz".  
  
`ArgumentException` is thrown if `identifier` is `null` or empty.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**AddRequest** An [AddRequest](PackageManager.Requests.AddRequest.html)
instance, which you can use to get the
[PackageInfo](PackageManager.PackageInfo.html) representing the package that
was added to the project from the `AddRequest.Result` property.

### Description

Adds a package dependency to the project. Requesting a new or different
dependency often leads to changing installed packages, but only after the
Package Manager constructs a dependency graph to solve any version conflicts.
For more information, see [Dependency and resolution](../Manual/upm-
dependencies.html).

`Add()` is an asynchronous operation. Before the operation is complete, you
can use the `AddRequest` instance to monitor the asynchronous operation.  
  
**Note:** Make sure any other Client operations have completed before calling
this method. For more information, see the note on the
[Client](PackageManager.Client.html) class reference page.
