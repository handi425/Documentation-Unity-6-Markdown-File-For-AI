### Description

Static class providing extension methods for [Animator](Animator.html) and the
animation C# jobs.

The extension methods in this class can directly be used on an
[Animator](Animator.html).  
  
Additional resources:
[IAnimationJobPlayable](Animations.IAnimationJobPlayable.html).

### Static Methods

[AddJobDependency](Animations.AnimatorJobExtensions.AddJobDependency.html)|
Creates a dependency between animator jobs and the job represented by the
supplied job handle. To add multiple job dependencies, call this method for
each job that need to run before the Animator's jobs.  
---|---  
[BindCustomStreamProperty](Animations.AnimatorJobExtensions.BindCustomStreamProperty.html)|
Create a custom property in the AnimationStream to pass extra data to
downstream animation jobs in your graph. Custom properties created in the
AnimationStream do not exist in the scene.  
[BindSceneProperty](Animations.AnimatorJobExtensions.BindSceneProperty.html)|
Create a PropertySceneHandle representing the new binding on the Component
property of a Transform in the Scene.  
[BindSceneTransform](Animations.AnimatorJobExtensions.BindSceneTransform.html)|
Create a TransformSceneHandle representing the new binding between the
Animator and a Transform in the Scene.  
[BindStreamProperty](Animations.AnimatorJobExtensions.BindStreamProperty.html)|
Create a PropertyStreamHandle representing the new binding on the Component
property of a Transform already bound to the Animator.  
[BindStreamTransform](Animations.AnimatorJobExtensions.BindStreamTransform.html)|
Create a TransformStreamHandle representing the new binding between the
Animator and a Transform already bound to the Animator.  
[CloseAnimationStream](Animations.AnimatorJobExtensions.CloseAnimationStream.html)|
Close a stream that has been opened using OpenAnimationStream.  
[OpenAnimationStream](Animations.AnimatorJobExtensions.OpenAnimationStream.html)|
Open a new stream on the Animator.  
[ResolveAllSceneHandles](Animations.AnimatorJobExtensions.ResolveAllSceneHandles.html)|
Newly created handles are always resolved lazily on the next access when the
jobs are run. To avoid a cpu spike while evaluating the jobs you can manually
resolve all handles from the main thread.

[UnbindAllSceneHandles](Animations.AnimatorJobExtensions.UnbindAllSceneHandles.html)|
Removes all PropertySceneHandles and TransformSceneHandles associated with the
Animator instance. Use this method to manage the lifecycle of scene handles
when the animated hierarchy changes.  
[UnbindAllStreamHandles](Animations.AnimatorJobExtensions.UnbindAllStreamHandles.html)|
Removes all PropertyStreamHandles and TransformStreamHandles associated with
the Animator instance. Use this method to manage the lifecycle of stream
