public static int captureFramerate;

### Description

The reciprocal of [Time.captureDeltaTime](Time-captureDeltaTime.html).

`captureFramerate` is the equivalent of (1.0 / [Time.captureDeltaTime](Time-
captureDeltaTime.html)) rounded to the nearest integer.  
  
Setting `captureFramerate` also sets [Time.captureDeltaTime](Time-
captureDeltaTime.html) to the equivalent inverse.  
  
Note that a value of zero for `captureFramerate` is equivalent to value of
zero for `captureDeltaTime`.
