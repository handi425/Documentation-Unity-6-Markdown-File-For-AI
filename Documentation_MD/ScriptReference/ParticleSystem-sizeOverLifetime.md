public
[ParticleSystem.SizeOverLifetimeModule](ParticleSystem.SizeOverLifetimeModule.html)
sizeOverLifetime;

### Description

Script interface for the SizeOverLifetimeModule of a Particle System.

This module controls the size of particles throughout their lifetime.  
  
Particle System modules do not need to be reassigned back to the system; they
are interfaces and not independent objects.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    [[RequireComponent](RequireComponent.html)(typeof([ParticleSystem](ParticleSystem.html)))]
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html) {
        void Start() {
            [ParticleSystem](ParticleSystem.html) ps = GetComponent<[ParticleSystem](ParticleSystem.html)>();
            var sz = ps.sizeOverLifetime;
            sz.enabled = true;  
      
            [AnimationCurve](AnimationCurve.html) curve = new [AnimationCurve](AnimationCurve.html)();
            curve.AddKey(0.0f, 0.1f);
            curve.AddKey(0.75f, 1.0f);  
      
            sz.size = new [ParticleSystem.MinMaxCurve](ParticleSystem.MinMaxCurve.html)(1.5f, curve);
        }
    }
