## Declaration

public static void DrawTexture([Rect](Rect.html) screenRect,
[Texture](Texture.html) texture, [Material](Material.html) mat = null, int
pass = -1);

## Declaration

public static void DrawTexture([Rect](Rect.html) screenRect,
[Texture](Texture.html) texture, int leftBorder, int rightBorder, int
topBorder, int bottomBorder, [Material](Material.html) mat = null, int pass =
-1);

## Declaration

public static void DrawTexture([Rect](Rect.html) screenRect,
[Texture](Texture.html) texture, [Rect](Rect.html) sourceRect, int leftBorder,
int rightBorder, int topBorder, int bottomBorder, [Material](Material.html)
mat = null, int pass = -1);

## Declaration

public static void DrawTexture([Rect](Rect.html) screenRect,
[Texture](Texture.html) texture, [Rect](Rect.html) sourceRect, int leftBorder,
int rightBorder, int topBorder, int bottomBorder, [Color](Color.html) color,
[Material](Material.html) mat = null, int pass = -1);

### Parameters

screenRect | Rectangle on the screen to use for the texture. In pixel coordinates with (0,0) in the upper-left corner.  
---|---  
texture |  [Texture](Texture.html) to draw.  
sourceRect | Region of the texture to use. In normalized coordinates with (0,0) in the bottom-left corner.  
leftBorder | Number of pixels from the left that are not affected by scale.  
rightBorder | Number of pixels from the right that are not affected by scale.  
topBorder | Number of pixels from the top that are not affected by scale.  
bottomBorder | Number of pixels from the bottom that are not affected by scale.  
color |  [Color](Color.html) that modulates the output. The neutral value is (0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5). Set as vertex color for the shader.  
mat | Custom [Material](Material.html) that can be used to draw the texture. Unity passes the texture into the shader as `_MainTex`. If null is passed, a default material with the Internal-GUITexture.shader is used.  
pass | If -1 (default), draws all passes in the material. Otherwise, draws given pass only.  
  
### Description

Draw a texture in screen coordinates.

If you want to draw a texture from inside of OnGUI code, you should only do
that from [EventType.Repaint](EventType.Repaint.html) events. It's probably
better to use [GUI.DrawTexture](GUI.DrawTexture.html) for GUI code.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        // Draws a texture on the screen at 10, 10 with 100 width, 100 height.  
      
        [Texture](Texture.html) aTexture;  
      
        void OnGUI()
        {
            if (Event.current.type.Equals([EventType.Repaint](EventType.Repaint.html)))
            {
                [Graphics.DrawTexture](Graphics.DrawTexture.html)(new [Rect](Rect.html)(10, 10, 100, 100), aTexture);
            }
        }
    }
