### Description

An enumeration that defines task priorities.

Progress indicators are sorted by priority, from highest to lowest. Priorities
also determine the visual behavior of progress indicators. Each item in this
enumeration defines the threshold value for each priority level. For example,
[Low](Progress.Priority.Low.html) is 2 and
[Normal](Progress.Priority.Normal.html) is 6, so values between 2 and 5 are
[Low](Progress.Priority.Low.html) priorities.

### Properties

[Unresponsive](Progress.Priority.Unresponsive.html)| An unresponsive task is
always shown as unresponsive.  
---|---  
[Idle](Progress.Priority.Idle.html)| An idle priority task cannot be
unresponsive, and is not displayed in the global progress bar.  
[Low](Progress.Priority.Low.html)| A low priority task cannot be unresponsive,
but is displayed in the global progress bar.  
[Normal](Progress.Priority.Normal.html)| A normal priority task can be
unresponsive, and is displayed in the global progress bar.  
[High](Progress.Priority.High.html)| A high priority task can be unresponsive,
and is displayed in the global progress bar.
