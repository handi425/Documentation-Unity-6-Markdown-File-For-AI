## Declaration

public float[,,] GetAlphamaps(int x, int y, int width, int height);

### Parameters

x | The x offset to read from.  
---|---  
y | The y offset to read from.  
width | The width of the alpha map area to read.  
height | The height of the alpha map area to read.  
  
### Returns

**float[,,]** A 3D array of floats, where the 3rd dimension represents the
mixing weight of each splatmap at each x,y coordinate.

### Description

Returns the alpha map at a position x, y given a width and height.

The returned array is three-dimensional - the first two dimensions represent x
and y coordinates on the map, while the third denotes the splatmap texture to
which the alphamap is applied.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        // Add some random "noise" to the alphamaps.
        void AddAlphaNoise([Terrain](Terrain.html) t, float noiseScale)
        {
            float[,,] maps = t.terrainData.GetAlphamaps(0, 0, t.terrainData.alphamapWidth, t.terrainData.alphamapHeight);  
      
            for (int y = 0; y < t.terrainData.alphamapHeight; y++)
            {
                for (int x = 0; x < t.terrainData.alphamapWidth; x++)
                {
                    float a0 = maps[x, y, 0];
                    float a1 = maps[x, y, 1];  
      
                    a0 += [Random.value](Random-value.html) * noiseScale;
                    a1 += [Random.value](Random-value.html) * noiseScale;  
      
                    float total = a0 + a1;  
      
                    maps[x, y, 0] = a0 / total;
                    maps[x, y, 1] = a1 / total;
                }
            }  
      
            t.terrainData.SetAlphamaps(0, 0, maps);
        }
    }
