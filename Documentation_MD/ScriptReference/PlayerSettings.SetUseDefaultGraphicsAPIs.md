Component in the Manual")

## Declaration

public static void SetUseDefaultGraphicsAPIs([BuildTarget](BuildTarget.html)
platform, bool automatic);

### Parameters

platform | Platform to set the flag for.  
---|---  
automatic | Should best available graphics API be used?  
  
### Description

Should a build platform use automatic graphics API choice.

By default each platform is using "automatic" graphics API detection and picks
the best available one. However it is possible to change that to explicitly
limit the graphics APIs used, see
[SetGraphicsAPIs](PlayerSettings.SetGraphicsAPIs.html).
