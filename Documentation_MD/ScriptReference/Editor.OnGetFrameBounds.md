### Description

Gets custom bounds for the target of this editor.

Use this method to retrieve the Bounds for a custom window derived from the
[Editor](Editor.Editor.html) class. This method is always used in conjunction
with [Editor.HasFrameBounds](Editor.HasFrameBounds.html) which either returns
true or false, depending on the implementation.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);  
      
    // This example traverses all bones in the hierarchy and calculates bounds for the entire object
    public class GameObjectEditorWindow: [Editor](Editor.html)
    {
        private bool HasFrameBounds()
        {
            // the result of this function depends on implementation
            // it will most likely be used to evaluate whether bounds
            // can exist for the targets of this [Editor](Editor.html) Window
            return Selection.objects.Length > 0;
        }  
      
        public [Bounds](Bounds.html) OnGetFrameBounds()
        {
            [Transform](Transform.html) bone = [Selection.activeTransform](Selection-activeTransform.html);
            [Bounds](Bounds.html) bounds = new [Bounds](Bounds.html)(bone.position, new [Vector3](Vector3.html)(0, 0, 0));
            foreach ([Transform](Transform.html) child in bone)
                bounds.Encapsulate(child.position);  
      
            if (bone.parent) bounds.Encapsulate(bone.parent.position);  
      
            return bounds;
        }
    }
