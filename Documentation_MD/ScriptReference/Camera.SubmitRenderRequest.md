## Declaration

public void SubmitRenderRequest(RequestData renderRequest);

### Parameters

renderRequest | RequestData.  
---|---  
  
### Description

Submit a renderRequest.

Call this method via ScriptableRenderer.SubmitRenderRequest. Use
ScriptableRenderer.SupportsRenderRequest to check if the active render
pipeline supports the `RequestData` type you selected.  
  
The UniversalRenderPipeline supports:  
  
\- ScriptableRenderer.StandardRequest, which renders a full URP camera stack
and outputs the result to the given target. You can only call this request on
Base Cameras. \- UniversalRenderPipeline.SingleCameraRequest, which renders a
single URP camera and outputs the result to the given target.  
  
The HDRenderPipeline supports ScriptableRenderer.StandardRequest, which
renders a single HDRP camera without [Arbitrary Output
Variables](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-
definition@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/AOVs.html) (AOVs) and outputs
the result to the given target. It uses a separate camera history from the
render loop, to ensure temporal effects are consistent.  
  
Refer to [Render requests](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-
pipelines.core@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/User-Render-Requests.html)
for more information about render requests in scriptable render pipelines
(SRPs).
