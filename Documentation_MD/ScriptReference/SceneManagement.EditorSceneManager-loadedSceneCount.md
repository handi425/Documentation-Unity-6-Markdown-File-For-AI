**Obsolete** EditorSceneManager.loadedSceneCount has been deprecated. Please
use SceneManager.loadedSceneCount.  
**Upgrade to[loadedSceneCount](SceneManagement.SceneManager-
loadedSceneCount.html)** public static int loadedSceneCount;

### Description

The number of loaded Scenes.

Returns the current number of loaded Scenes in the Editor. The difference
between loadedSceneCount and
[SceneManager.sceneCount](SceneManagement.SceneManager-sceneCount.html) is for
scenes that are shown in the Hierarchy but are unloaded.
[SceneManager.sceneCount](SceneManagement.SceneManager-sceneCount.html) counts
those scenes, but loadedSceneCount does not.

    
    
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);
    using UnityEditor.SceneManagement;  
      
    public class Example
    {
        // adds a custom menu item which displays the number of open Scenes in a Dialogue [Box](UIElements.Box.html)
        [[MenuItem](MenuItem.html)("SceneExample/Number Of Scenes")]
        public static void NumberOfScenes()
        {
            [EditorUtility.DisplayDialog](EditorUtility.DisplayDialog.html)("Number of loaded Scenes:", EditorSceneManager.loadedSceneCount.ToString(), "OK");
        }
    }
