public IReadOnlyDictionary<string,ModuleBuildGradleFile>
AdditionalLibrariesBuildGradleFiles;

### Description

A representation of the `build.gradle` files that were added to plugins
(libraries) that didn't have a `build.gradle` file.

Files are located in `unityLibrary/{pluginName}/build.gradle`.  
  
If you have a plugin called `myLibrary` that doesn't contain `build.gradle`
file, the file will be generated and placed in
`unityLibrary/mylibrary.androidlib/build.gradle`. You can use this path to
access the file object in this dictionary.

    
    
    using System.IO;
    using UnityEditor.Android;
    using [Unity.Android.Gradle](Unity.Android.Gradle.html);  
      
    public class ModifyProjectScript : [AndroidProjectFilesModifier](Android.AndroidProjectFilesModifier.html)
    {
        public override void OnModifyAndroidProjectFiles([AndroidProjectFiles](Android.AndroidProjectFiles.html) projectFiles)
        {
            // Add a Google() repository to a build.gradle file in mylibrary.androidlib library
            var myLibraryBuildGradle = projectFiles.AdditionalLibrariesBuildGradleFiles[Path.Combine("unityLibrary", "mylibrary.androidlib", "build.gradle")];
            myLibraryBuildGradle.Repositories.AddRepository([Repositories.Google](Unity.Android.Gradle.Repositories.Google.html));
        }
    }
