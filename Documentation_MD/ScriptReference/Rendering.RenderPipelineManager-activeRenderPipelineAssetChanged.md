        private void OnDestroy()
        {
            [RenderPipelineManager.activeRenderPipelineAssetChanged](Rendering.RenderPipelineManager-activeRenderPipelineAssetChanged.html) -= RenderPipelineManager_activeRenderPipelineAssetChanged;
        }

        {
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)($"[RenderPipelineAsset](Rendering.RenderPipelineAsset.html) has changed {(from != null ? from.GetType().Name : "Built-In")} to {(to != null ? to.GetType().Name : "Built-In")}");
