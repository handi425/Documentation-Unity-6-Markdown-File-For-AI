## Declaration

public static bool ConvertTexture([Texture](Texture.html) src,
[Texture](Texture.html) dst);

## Declaration

public static bool ConvertTexture([Texture](Texture.html) src, int srcElement,
[Texture](Texture.html) dst, int dstElement);

## Declaration

public static bool
ConvertTexture([Rendering.GraphicsTexture](Rendering.GraphicsTexture.html)
src, [Rendering.GraphicsTexture](Rendering.GraphicsTexture.html) dst);

## Declaration

public static bool
ConvertTexture([Rendering.GraphicsTexture](Rendering.GraphicsTexture.html)
src, int srcElement,
[Rendering.GraphicsTexture](Rendering.GraphicsTexture.html) dst, int
dstElement);

### Parameters

src | The source texture. The [TextureDimension](Rendering.TextureDimension.html) must be Tex2D or Cube.  
---|---  
dst | The destination texture. The [TextureDimension](Rendering.TextureDimension.html) must be Tex2D, Tex2DArray, Cube, or CubeArray. The texture must also be uncompressed and correspond to a supported [RenderTextureFormat](RenderTextureFormat.html).  
srcElement | The element in the source texture to copy from. Use [CubemapFace](CubemapFace.html) if `src` is a Cubemap. Set the value to `0` if `src` is a 2D texture.  
dstElement | The element in the source texture to copy to. For example, the [CubemapFace](CubemapFace.html) in a Cubemap or the slice in a texture array. Set the value to `0` if `dst` is a 2D texture.  
  
### Returns

**bool** `true` if the method succeeded.

### Description

Copies the pixel data from one texture, converts the data into a different
format, and copies it into another texture.

This method converts and copies pixel data from one texture to another on the
GPU.  
  
When you use `ConvertTexture`, Unity does the following:

  1. Creates a temporary [RenderTexture](RenderTexture.html) that matches the size and format of the `dst` texture.
  2. Uses [Graphics.Blit](Graphics.Blit.html) to copy from the `src` texture to the temporary render texture, and converts to the format of `dst`.
  3. Uses [Graphics.CopyTexture](Graphics.CopyTexture.html) to copy from the temporary render texture to the `dst` texture.

This means it might be faster to convert the texture before you load it into
Unity. Alternatively, if you can create `dst` as a render texture (or a
graphics texture with
[GraphicsTextureDescriptorFlags.RenderTarget](Rendering.GraphicsTextureDescriptorFlags.RenderTarget.html)
enabled), you can use [Graphics.Blit](Graphics.Blit.html) instead.  
  
You can use textures with different sizes for `src` and `dst`.  
  
`ConvertTexture` doesn't support the following conversions:

  * Cubemap to Texture2D.
  * Conversions that use render targets (RenderTextures or GraphicsTextures that have [the RenderTarget flag](Rendering.GraphicsTextureDescriptorFlags.RenderTarget.html) enabled). Use [Graphics.Blit](Graphics.Blit.html) instead.

You can't use `ConvertTexture` if you use OpenGL with MacOS. Depending on your
graphics API, you might not be able to do some types of conversions. For more
information on compatibility, see [SystemInfo.copyTextureSupport](SystemInfo-
copyTextureSupport.html),
[CopyTextureSupport](Rendering.CopyTextureSupport.html) and
[Graphics.CopyTexture](Graphics.CopyTexture.html).  
  
To copy the converted texture from the GPU to the CPU, use
Texture2D.RequestIntoNativeArray.
