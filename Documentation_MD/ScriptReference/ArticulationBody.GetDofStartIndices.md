## Declaration

public int GetDofStartIndices(List<int> dofStartIndices);

### Parameters

dofStartIndices | Supplied list of integers to read back and store the data.   
---|---  
  
### Returns

**int** Total degrees of freedom for the entire hierarchy of articulation
bodies.

### Description

Calculates and reads back reduced coordinate data start indexes in reduced
coordinate data buffer for every articulation body in the hierarchy.

In order to read back or set entire articulation hierarchy data in reduced
coordinates where every degree of freedom is represented by float value, one
needs to find the location of reduced cordinates data for particular
ArticulationBody. This can be achieved by calling
[ArticulationBody.GetDofStartIndices](ArticulationBody.GetDofStartIndices.html)
and indexing resulting list by the particular body index via
[ArticulationBody.index](ArticulationBody-index.html). Number of degrees of
freedom for particular articulation body can be found using
[ArticulationBody.dofCount](ArticulationBody-dofCount.html). Additional
resources: [index](ArticulationBody-index.html),
[GetDofStartIndices](ArticulationBody.GetDofStartIndices.html),
[dofCount](ArticulationBody-dofCount.html).
