public [CollisionDetectionMode](CollisionDetectionMode.html)
collisionDetectionMode;

### Description

The Rigidbody's collision detection mode.

Use this to set up a Rigidbody for continuous collision detection. You can use
continuous collision detection to prevent fast moving objects from passing
through other objects without detecting collisions.  
  
For best results, set this value to
[CollisionDetectionMode.ContinuousDynamic](CollisionDetectionMode.ContinuousDynamic.html)
for fast moving objects. For other objects which these need to collide with,
set it to
[CollisionDetectionMode.Continuous](CollisionDetectionMode.Continuous.html).
These two options impact physics performance. Alternatively, you can use
[CollisionDetectionMode.ContinuousSpeculative](CollisionDetectionMode.ContinuousSpeculative.html),
which has less of an impact on performance and can also be used on kinematic
objects. If you don't have issues with collisions of fast objects, leave it
set to the default value of
[CollisionDetectionMode.Discrete](CollisionDetectionMode.Discrete.html).  
  
Continuous Collision Detection is only supported for Rigidbodies with Sphere-,
Capsule- or BoxColliders. Additional resources:
[CollisionDetectionMode](CollisionDetectionMode.html).
