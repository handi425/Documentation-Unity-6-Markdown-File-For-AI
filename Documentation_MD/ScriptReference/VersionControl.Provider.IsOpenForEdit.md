## Declaration

public static bool
IsOpenForEdit([VersionControl.Asset](VersionControl.Asset.html) asset);

### Parameters

asset | Asset to test.  
---|---  
  
### Description

Returns true if an asset can be edited.

Version control systems like Perforce or Plastic SCM require that an asset be
checked out before it can be edited. In such cases this task will test whether
the asset is checked out and editable.

    
    
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);
    using UnityEditor.VersionControl;
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class EditorScript : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        [[MenuItem](MenuItem.html)("Version Control/IsOpenForEdit")]
        public static void ExampleIsOpenForEdit()
        {
            [AssetList](VersionControl.AssetList.html) assets = new [AssetList](VersionControl.AssetList.html)();
            assets.Add([Provider.GetAssetByPath](VersionControl.Provider.GetAssetByPath.html)("Assets/ExampleAsset.cs"));
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("ExampleAsset.cs is editable?" + [Provider.IsOpenForEdit](VersionControl.Provider.IsOpenForEdit.html)(assets[0]));
        }
    }
    

Some version control systems like Git support editing without checking out the
asset, in this case the task will always return true.
