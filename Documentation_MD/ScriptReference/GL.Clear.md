## Declaration

public static void Clear(bool clearDepth, bool clearColor, [Color](Color.html)
backgroundColor, float depth = 1.0f);

### Parameters

clearDepth | Should the depth buffer be cleared?  
---|---  
clearColor | Should the color buffer be cleared?  
backgroundColor | The color to clear with, used only if `clearColor` is `true`.  
depth | The depth to clear the z-buffer with, used only if `clearDepth` is `true`. The valid range is from 0 (near plane) to 1 (far plane). The value is graphics API agnostic: the abstraction layer will convert the value to match the convention of the current graphics API.  
  
### Description

Clear the current render buffer.

This clears the screen or the active [RenderTexture](RenderTexture.html) you
are drawing into. The cleared area is limited by the active viewport. This
operation might alter the model/view/projection matrices.  
  
In most cases, a Camera will already be configured to clear the screen or
[RenderTexture](RenderTexture.html) and you will not need to perform this
operation manually.
