public float streamingMipmapBias;

### Description

Offset applied to the mipmap level chosen by the texture streaming system for
any textures visible from this camera. This Offset can take either a positive
or negative value.

When texture streaming is active, Unity loads mipmap levels for textures based
on their distance from all active cameras. This bias is added to all textures
visible from this camera and allows you to force smaller or larger mipmap
levels to be loaded for textures visible from this camera.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
