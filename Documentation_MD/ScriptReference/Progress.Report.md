When you report in steps, you can set the label for the steps with
[Progress.SetStepLabel](Progress.SetStepLabel.html). Note: Changes are applied
on the next application tick unless you call this function from the main
thread using a synchronous progress indicator (see
[Synchronous](Progress.Options.Synchronous.html)).
