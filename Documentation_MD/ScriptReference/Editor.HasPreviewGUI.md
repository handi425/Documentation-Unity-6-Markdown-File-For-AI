## Declaration

public bool HasPreviewGUI();

### Returns

**bool** True if this component can be Previewed in its current state.

### Description

Override this method in subclasses if you implement
[OnPreviewGUI](Editor.OnPreviewGUI.html).

You can also use it to disable or enable preview depending on the target
asset. The default implementation simply returns false, so if you override
[OnPreviewGUI](Editor.OnPreviewGUI.html) you have to override this method as
well.  
  
**Note:** Inspector previews are limited to the primary editor of persistent
objects (assets), e.g., GameObjectInspector, MaterialEditor, TextureInspector.
This means that it is currently not possible for a component to have its own
inspector preview.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);  
      
    public class GameObjectEditorWindow: [EditorWindow](EditorWindow.html)
    {
        [GameObject](GameObject.html) gameObject;
        [Editor](Editor.html) gameObjectEditor;  
      
        [[MenuItem](MenuItem.html)("Window/[GameObject](GameObject.html) [Editor](Editor.html)")]
        static void ShowWindow()
        {
            GetWindow<GameObjectEditorWindow>("[GameObject](GameObject.html) [Editor](Editor.html)");
        }  
      
        void OnGUI()
        {
            gameObject = ([GameObject](GameObject.html)) [EditorGUILayout.ObjectField](EditorGUILayout.ObjectField.html)(gameObject, typeof([GameObject](GameObject.html)), true);  
      
            if (gameObject != null)
            {
                if (gameObjectEditor == null)
                    gameObjectEditor = [Editor.CreateEditor](Editor.CreateEditor.html)(gameObject);  
      
                gameObjectEditor.OnPreviewGUI([GUILayoutUtility.GetRect](GUILayoutUtility.GetRect.html)(500, 500), [EditorStyles.whiteLabel](EditorStyles-whiteLabel.html));
            }
        }
    }
