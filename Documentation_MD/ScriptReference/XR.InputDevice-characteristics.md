public [XR.InputDeviceCharacteristics](XR.InputDeviceCharacteristics.html)
characteristics;

### Description

Read Only. A bitmask of enumerated flags describing the characteristics of
this InputDevice.

Use **Characteristics** to determine whether an **InputDevice** has specific
features or capabilities. For example, if the set of
[InputDeviceCharacteristics](XR.InputDeviceCharacteristics.html) includes both
[InputDeviceCharacteristics.HeldInHand](XR.InputDeviceCharacteristics.HeldInHand.html)
and
[InputDeviceCharacteristics.Left](XR.InputDeviceCharacteristics.Left.html),
then the device provides tracking data for the left hand.  
  
**Characteristics** is a bitmask. Use the bitwise operators to test for
specific flags. For example, to determine whether an **InputDevice** has a
camera, use the conditional:  
  
`(inputDevice.characteristics & InputDeviceCharacteristics.Camera) ==
InputDeviceCharacteristics.Camera`.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
