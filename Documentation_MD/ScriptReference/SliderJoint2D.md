breaks the breakForce or breakTorque.  
[breakForce](Joint2D-breakForce.html)| The force that needs to be applied for
this joint to break.  
[breakTorque](Joint2D-breakTorque.html)| The torque that needs to be applied
for this joint to break.  
[connectedBody](Joint2D-connectedBody.html)| The Rigidbody2D object to which
the other end of the joint is attached (ie, the object without the joint
component).  
[enableCollision](Joint2D-enableCollision.html)| Should the two Rigidbody2D
connected with this joint collide with each other?  
[reactionForce](Joint2D-reactionForce.html)| Gets the reaction force of the
joint.  
[reactionTorque](Joint2D-reactionTorque.html)| Gets the reaction torque of the
