## Declaration

public void DispatchIndirect(int kernelIndex,
[ComputeBuffer](ComputeBuffer.html) argsBuffer, uint argsOffset = 0);

## Declaration

public void DispatchIndirect(int kernelIndex,
[GraphicsBuffer](GraphicsBuffer.html) argsBuffer, uint argsOffset = 0);

### Parameters

kernelIndex | Which kernel to execute. A single compute shader asset can have multiple kernel entry points.  
---|---  
argsBuffer | Buffer with dispatch arguments.  
argsOffset | The byte offset into the buffer, where the draw arguments start.  
  
### Description

Execute a compute shader.

This function "runs" the compute shader, with the given work size read
directly from the GPU. Typical use case is generating arbitrary amount of data
from a [ComputeShader](ComputeShader.html) and then dispatching that, without
requiring a readback to the CPU.  
  
Buffer with arguments, `argsBuffer`, has to have three integer numbers at
given `argsOffset` offset: number of work groups in X dimension, number of
work groups in Y dimension, number of work groups in Z dimension.  
  
Within each work group, a number of shader invocations ("threads") are done.
The work group size is specified in the compute shader itself (using
"numthreads" HLSL attribute), and the total amount of compute shader
invocations is thus group count multiplied by the thread group size. Work
group size can be queried using
[GetKernelThreadGroupSizes](ComputeShader.GetKernelThreadGroupSizes.html)
function.  
  
This very much maps to Direct3D11 DispatchIndirect, OpenGL
glDispatchComputeIndirect and equivalent functions on other graphics APIs.
