### Description

Use this class to set [SceneView](SceneView.html) Camera properties.

    
    
    // Create a folder (right click in the Assets directory, click **Create** >**Folder**)
    // and name it _Editor_ if one doesn't exist already. Create a new C# script called _CustomSettings_
    // and place it in that folder.  
      
    // This script creates a new menu item **Edit** >**SceneView Settings** >**Update Camera Settings** in the main menu.
    // Use it to update the [Camera](Camera.html) settings in the [Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html) view.  
      
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);  
      
    public class CustomSettings
    {
        [[MenuItem](MenuItem.html)("Edit/[SceneView](SceneView.html) [Settings](CameraEditor.Settings.html)/[Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html) [Camera](Camera.html) [Settings](CameraEditor.Settings.html)")]
        static void UpdateCameraSettings()
        {
            [SceneView.CameraSettings](SceneView.CameraSettings.html) settings = new [SceneView.CameraSettings](SceneView.CameraSettings.html)();
            settings.accelerationEnabled = false;
            settings.speedMin = 1f;
            settings.speedMax = 10f;
            settings.speed = 5f;
            settings.easingEnabled = true;
            settings.easingDuration = 0.6f;
            settings.dynamicClip = false;
            settings.fieldOfView = 120f;
            settings.nearClip = 0.01f;
            settings.farClip = 1000f;
            settings.occlusionCulling = true;
            [SceneView](SceneView.html) sceneView = [SceneView.lastActiveSceneView](SceneView-lastActiveSceneView.html);
            sceneView.cameraSettings = settings;
        }
    }
    

### Properties

[accelerationEnabled](SceneView.CameraSettings-accelerationEnabled.html)|
Enables Camera movement acceleration in the SceneView. This makes the Camera
accelerate for the duration of movement.  
---|---  
[dynamicClip](SceneView.CameraSettings-dynamicClip.html)| When enabled, the
SceneView Camera's near and far clipping planes are calculated relative to the
viewport size of the Scene. When disabled, nearClip and farClip are used
instead.  
[easingDuration](SceneView.CameraSettings-easingDuration.html)| How long it
takes for the speed of the SceneView Camera to accelerate to its initial full
speed. Measured in seconds. Valid values are between [0.1, 2].  
[easingEnabled](SceneView.CameraSettings-easingEnabled.html)| Enables Camera
movement easing in the SceneView. This makes the Camera ease in when it starts
moving, and ease out when it stops.  
[farClip](SceneView.CameraSettings-farClip.html)| The furthest point from the
SceneView Camera that drawing occurs. The valid minimum value is 0.02.  
[fieldOfView](SceneView.CameraSettings-fieldOfView.html)| The height of the
view angle for the SceneView Camera. Measured in degrees vertically, or along
the local Y axis.  
[nearClip](SceneView.CameraSettings-nearClip.html)| The closest point to the
SceneView Camera where drawing occurs. The valid minimum value is 0.01.  
[occlusionCulling](SceneView.CameraSettings-occlusionCulling.html)| Enables
occlusion culling in the SceneView. This prevents Unity from rendering
GameObjects that the Camera cannot see because they are hidden by other
GameObjects.  
[speed](SceneView.CameraSettings-speed.html)| The speed of the SceneView
Camera.  
[speedMax](SceneView.CameraSettings-speedMax.html)| The maximum speed of the
SceneView Camera. Valid values are between [0.0002, 10000].  
[speedMin](SceneView.CameraSettings-speedMin.html)| The minimum speed of the
SceneView Camera. Valid values are between [0.0001, 9999].  
[speedNormalized](SceneView.CameraSettings-speedNormalized.html)| The
normalized speed of the SceneView Camera, relative to the current
minimum/maximum range. Valid values are between [0, 1].  
  
### Constructors

[SceneView.CameraSettings](SceneView.CameraSettings-ctor.html)| Create a new
CameraSettings object.
