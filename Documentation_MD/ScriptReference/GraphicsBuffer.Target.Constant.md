### Description

GraphicsBuffer can be used as a constant buffer (uniform buffer).

If you use this target, you can use the [GraphicsBuffer](GraphicsBuffer.html)
as a parameter to
[ComputeShader.SetConstantBuffer](ComputeShader.SetConstantBuffer.html) and
[Material.SetConstantBuffer](Material.SetConstantBuffer.html).  
  
If you also need the buffer to be bound as a structured buffer, you must add
the [GraphicsBuffer.Target.Structured](GraphicsBuffer.Target.Structured.html)
flag. Some renderers (such as DX11) do not support binding buffers as both
constant and structured buffers.  
  
The data layout of a shader's constant buffer may be different depending on
the graphics API. This means
[ComputeShader.SetConstantBuffer](ComputeShader.SetConstantBuffer.html) or
[Material.SetConstantBuffer](Material.SetConstantBuffer.html) might overwrite
data or set variables to the wrong values. See [Writing shaders for different
graphics APIs](../Manual/SL-PlatformDifferences.html) for more information.
