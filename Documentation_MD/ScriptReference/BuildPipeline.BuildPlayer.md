## Declaration

public static [Build.Reporting.BuildReport](Build.Reporting.BuildReport.html)
BuildPlayer([BuildPlayerOptions](BuildPlayerOptions.html) buildPlayerOptions);

### Parameters

buildPlayerOptions | Provide various options to control the behavior of [BuildPipeline.BuildPlayer](BuildPipeline.BuildPlayer.html).  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**BuildReport** A [BuildReport](Build.Reporting.BuildReport.html) object
containing build process information.

### Description

Builds a player.

Use this function to programatically create a build of your project.  
  
Calling this method will invalidate any variables in the editor script that
reference GameObjects, so they will need to be reacquired after the call.  
  
Scripts can run at strategic points during the build by implementing one of
the supported callback interfaces, for example
[BuildPlayerProcessor](Build.BuildPlayerProcessor.html),
[IPreprocessBuildWithReport](Build.IPreprocessBuildWithReport.html),
[IProcessSceneWithReport](Build.IProcessSceneWithReport.html) and
[IPostprocessBuildWithReport](Build.IPostprocessBuildWithReport.html).  
  
Note: Be aware that changes to [scripting symbols](../Manual/platform-
dependent-compilation.html) only take effect at the next domain reload, when
scripts are recompiled.  
  
This means if you make changes to the defined scripting symbols via code using
PlayerSettings.SetDefineSymbolsForGroup without a domain reload before calling
this function, those changes won't take effect.  
  
It also means that the built-in scripting symbols defined for the current
active target platform (such as UNITY_STANDALONE_WIN, or UNITY_ANDROID) remain
in place even if you try to build for a different target platform, which can
result in the wrong code being compiled into your build.
