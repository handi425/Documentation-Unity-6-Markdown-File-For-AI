### Description

Style value that specifies whether or not a VisualElement is visible.

### Properties

[Visible](UIElements.Visibility.Visible.html)|  The VisualElement is visible.
Default Value.  
---|---  
[Hidden](UIElements.Visibility.Hidden.html)|  The VisualElement is hidden.
Hidden VisualElements will take up space in their parent layout if their
positionType is set to PositionType.Relative. Use the DisplayStyle style
property to both hide and remove a VisualElement from the parent VisualElement
layout. Note, this is the enum value used when setting styles via
VisualElement.style.visibility. In C#, you can just use VisualElement.visible
= false.
