## Declaration

public static void IgnoreCollision([Collider2D](Collider2D.html) collider1,
[Collider2D](Collider2D.html) collider2, bool ignore = true);

### Parameters

collider1 | The first Collider to compare to `collider2`.  
---|---  
collider2 | The second Collider to compare to `collider1`.  
ignore | Whether collisions/triggers between `collider1` and `collider2` should be ignored or not.  
  
### Description

Makes the collision detection system ignore all collisions/triggers between
`collider1` and `collider2`.

Ignoring collisions refers to any type of interaction between the selected
Colliders i.e. no collision or trigger interaction will occur. Collision
layers are first checked to see the two layers can interact and if not then no
interactions take place. Following that, ignoring specific Colliders
interactions will occur.  
  
IgnoreCollision has a few limitations: 1) It is not persistent. This means
that the ignore collision state will not be stored in the editor when saving a
Scene. 2) You can only apply the ignore collision to Colliders in active game
objects. When deactivating the Collider the IgnoreCollision state will be lost
and you have to call Physics2D.IgnoreCollision again. Additional resources:
[Physics2D.GetIgnoreCollision](Physics2D.GetIgnoreCollision.html),
[Physics2D.IgnoreLayerCollision](Physics2D.IgnoreLayerCollision.html).

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        // Instantiate a bullet and make it ignore collisions with this object.  
      
        [Transform](Transform.html) bulletPrefab;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            var bullet = Instantiate(bulletPrefab) as [Transform](Transform.html);
            [Physics2D.IgnoreCollision](Physics2D.IgnoreCollision.html)(bullet.GetComponent<[Collider2D](Collider2D.html)>(), GetComponent<[Collider2D](Collider2D.html)>());
        }
    }
