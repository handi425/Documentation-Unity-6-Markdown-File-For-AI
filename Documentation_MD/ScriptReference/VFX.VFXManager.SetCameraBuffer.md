## Declaration

public static void SetCameraBuffer([Camera](Camera.html) cam,
[VFX.VFXCameraBufferTypes](VFX.VFXCameraBufferTypes.html) type,
[Texture](Texture.html) buffer, int x, int y, int width, int height);

### Parameters

cam | The Camera to set the buffer for.  
---|---  
type | The type of buffer to set.  
buffer | The buffer to set.  
x | X offset of the viewport in the buffer.  
y | Y offset of the viewport in the buffer.  
width | Width of the viewport in the buffer.  
height | Height of the viewport in the buffer.  
  
### Description

Use this method to set the buffer of a given type for this Camera. This allows
the VFX Manager to use the buffer.

In custom Scriptable Render Pipelines, this buffer allows the VFXManager to
use buffer behaviors for the Camera, for example depth collisions. The buffer
must be available during the VFX update of the next frame. To query the need
for a buffer, call
[VFXManager.IsCameraBufferNeeded](VFX.VFXManager.IsCameraBufferNeeded.html).
