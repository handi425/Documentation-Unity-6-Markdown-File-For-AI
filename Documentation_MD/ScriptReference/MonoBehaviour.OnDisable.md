[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-MonoBehaviour.html "Go to MonoBehaviour
Component in the Manual")

### Description

This function is called when the behaviour becomes disabled.

This is also called when the object is destroyed and can be used for any
cleanup code. When scripts are reloaded after compilation has finished,
OnDisable will be called, followed by an OnEnable after the script has been
loaded.

    
    
    // Implement OnDisable and OnEnable script functions.
    // These functions will be called when the attached [GameObject](GameObject.html)
    // is toggled.
    // This example also supports the [Editor](Editor.html).  The [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html) function
    // will be called, for example, when the position of the
    // [GameObject](GameObject.html) is changed.  
      
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    [[ExecuteInEditMode](ExecuteInEditMode.html)]
    public class PrintOnOff : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void OnDisable()
        {
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("PrintOnDisable: script was disabled");
        }  
      
        void OnEnable()
        {
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("PrintOnEnable: script was enabled");
        }  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
    #if UNITY_EDITOR
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("[Editor](Editor.html) causes this [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)");
    #endif
        }
    }
    

**Note:** [OnDisable](MonoBehaviour.OnDisable.html) cannot be a co-routine.
