### Description

Provides timing and other statistics from XR subsystems.

The XRStats class allows XR SDK providers to expose timing and other
statistics related to their XR subsystems. Such statistics can be used by XR
application developers for profiling and making dynamic performance
adjustments. For example, an application could dynamically adjust properties
like [XRSettings.eyeTextureResolutionScale](XR.XRSettings-
eyeTextureResolutionScale.html) or
[XRSettings.renderViewportScale](XR.XRSettings-renderViewportScale.html) at
run time to improve performance based on statistics provided by an XR
subsystem.  
  
`Note:` XR SDK providers can use this class to provide their own, device-
specific class for reporting statistics. XR application developers should not
need to use the XRStats class directly.

### Static Methods

[TryGetStat](XR.Provider.XRStats.TryGetStat.html)| Retrieve a statistic for an
XR subsystem.
