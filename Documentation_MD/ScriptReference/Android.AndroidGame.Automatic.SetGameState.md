## Declaration

public static void
SetGameState([Android.AndroidGameState](Android.AndroidGameState.html) mode);

### Parameters

mode |  [AndroidGameState](Android.AndroidGameState.html) value.  
---|---  
  
### Description

Sets the current [AndroidGameState](Android.AndroidGameState.html) to be used
for [Automated game state hinting in Unity](../Manual/android-game-state-
hinting.html). Requires API level 33 (Android 13).

You can set the mode parameter based on the current game state. For example,
you can use [AndroidGameState.None](Android.AndroidGameState.None.html) for
displaying the game menu and
[AndroidGameState.GamePlayInterruptible](Android.AndroidGameState.GamePlayInterruptible.html)
or
[AndroidGameState.GamePlayUninterruptible](Android.AndroidGameState.GamePlayUninterruptible.html)
during the gameplay.  
  
Once set, the mode remains unchanged until you call this method again.
However, if the game is interrupted by a full-screen video or a full-screen
ad, the mode automatically changes to
[AndroidGameState.Content](Android.AndroidGameState.Content.html).  
  
When target device does not support the required API level, no action is
taken.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.Android;  
      
    public class MainMenu : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            [AndroidGame.Automatic.SetGameState](Android.AndroidGame.Automatic.SetGameState.html)([AndroidGameState.None](Android.AndroidGameState.None.html));
        }
    }
