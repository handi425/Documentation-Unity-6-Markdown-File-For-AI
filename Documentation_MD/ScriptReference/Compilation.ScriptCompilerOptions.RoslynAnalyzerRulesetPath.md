public string RoslynAnalyzerRulesetPath;

### Description

Stores the path to the Roslyn ruleset file.

You can define your own rules on how to handle the various warnings and errors
that Roslyn analyzers raise. You must put these rules inside a file with the
.ruleset extension. Unity detects this .ruleset file, and stores its path
inside RoslynAnalyzerRulesetPath.  
  
In the root folder, you can store a ruleset file named "Default.ruleset". The
rules defined in Default.ruleset apply to all predefined assemblies, as well
as all assemblies that are built using .asmdef files.  
  
To override the rules in Default.ruleset for a predefined assembly, create a
.ruleset file in the root folder with the name
[PredefinedAssemblyName].ruleset. For example, the rules in Assembly-
CSharp.ruleset apply to Assembly-CSharp.dll.  
  
Only these .ruleset files are permitted inside the root folder: \-
Default.ruleset \- Assembly-CSharp.ruleset \- Assembly-CSharp-
firstpass.ruleset \- Assembly-CSharp-Editor.ruleset \- Assembly-CSharp-Editor-
firstpass.ruleset  
  
To override the rules in Default.ruleset for an assembly built using an
.asmdef file, create a .ruleset file in the same folder as its .asmdef file.
You can give it any name you like. The name of this ruleset file does not
necessarily have to match the name of the assembly.
