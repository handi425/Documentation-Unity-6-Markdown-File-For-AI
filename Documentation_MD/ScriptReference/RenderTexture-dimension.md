Component in the Manual")

public [Rendering.TextureDimension](Rendering.TextureDimension.html)
dimension;

### Description

Dimensionality (type) of the render texture.

By default render textures are "2D" type, but it is also possible to have
Cubemap or 3D render textures by changing dimension before they are created.  
  
[Cubemap](Cubemap.html) render textures are most often used for dynamic
cubemap reflections, see
[Camera.RenderToCubemap](Camera.RenderToCubemap.html). A cubemap render
texture must have the same [width](RenderTexture-width.html) and
[height](RenderTexture-height.html), and must be power of two size.  
  
3D (volumetric) render textures currently only work on compute shader capable
platforms (like [UsingDX11GL3Features](../Manual/UsingDX11GL3Features.html)).
You can render into them using "random access writes" from a pixel shader or a
compute shader. Use [volumeDepth](RenderTexture-volumeDepth.html) to set 3D
depth, and [enableRandomWrite](RenderTexture-enableRandomWrite.html) to enable
arbitrary writes into it.  
  
Additional resources: [TextureDimension](Rendering.TextureDimension.html).
