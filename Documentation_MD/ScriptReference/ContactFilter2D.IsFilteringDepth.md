## Declaration

public bool IsFilteringDepth([GameObject](GameObject.html) obj);

### Parameters

obj | The [GameObject](GameObject.html) used to check the z-position (depth) of [Transform.position](Transform-position.html).  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**bool** Returns true when `obj` is excluded by the filter and false if
otherwise.

### Description

Checks if the [Transform](Transform.html) for `obj` is within the depth range
to be filtered.

Filtering is defined as including or excluding objects based upon a specific
condition. Depth filtering checks the z-position of a
[GameObject](GameObject.html) [Transform.position](Transform-position.html)
and includes it when it is within the depth range and excludes it if
otherwise. IsFilteringDepth returns true when
[useDepth](ContactFilter2D-useDepth.html) is set to true and the `obj`
transform's z-position is outside the depth defined by
[minDepth](ContactFilter2D-minDepth.html) and
[maxDepth](ContactFilter2D-maxDepth.html). This indicates the `obj` is
filtered which means it should be excluded. IsFilteringDepth returns false if
otherwise. **Note:** : Setting
[useOutsideDepth](ContactFilter2D-useOutsideDepth.html) to true inverts the
function behavior and it returns opposite results. Additional resources:
[useDepth](ContactFilter2D-useDepth.html), ::ref:minDepth &
[maxDepth](ContactFilter2D-maxDepth.html).
