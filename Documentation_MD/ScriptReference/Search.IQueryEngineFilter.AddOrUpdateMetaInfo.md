## Declaration

public [Search.IQueryEngineFilter](Search.IQueryEngineFilter.html)
AddOrUpdateMetaInfo(string key, string value);

### Parameters

key | The key of the information.  
---|---  
value | The value of the information.  
  
### Returns

**IQueryEngineFilter** The current filter.

### Description

Add or update additional information specific to the filter.

You can use this function to add additional information on the filter.

    
    
    // Add a description to the filter
    var descriptionKey = "desc";
    var descriptionValue = "This filters the objects based on their id.";
    var exampleKey = "example";
    var exampleValue = "id>10 or id=2";
    queryEngine.TryGetFilter("id", out var filter);
    filter.AddOrUpdateMetaInfo(descriptionKey, descriptionValue)
        .AddOrUpdateMetaInfo(exampleKey, exampleValue);
    

You can then retrieve that information by accessing the
[metaInfo](Search.IQueryEngineFilter-metaInfo.html) property directly.

    
    
    var descriptionKey = "desc";
    var allFilters = queryEngine.GetAllFilters();
    var filtersWithDescription = allFilters.Where(f => f.metaInfo.ContainsKey(descriptionKey));
    

See [metaInfo](Search.IQueryEngineFilter-metaInfo.html) for a complete
example.
