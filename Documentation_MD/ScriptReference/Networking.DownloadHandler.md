### Description

Manage and process HTTP response body data received from a remote server.

DownloadHandler objects are helper objects. When attached to a
[UnityWebRequest](Networking.UnityWebRequest.html), they define how to handle
HTTP response body data received from a remote server. Generally, they are
used to buffer, stream and/or process response bodies.  
  
DownloadHandler is a base class. Depending on usage scenario, different
specialized classes are available.
[DownloadHandlerBuffer](Networking.DownloadHandlerBuffer.html) provides basic
buffering, while
[DownloadHandlerTexture](Networking.DownloadHandlerTexture.html) and
[DownloadHandlerAssetBundle](Networking.DownloadHandlerAssetBundle.html)
provide more efficient solutions for [Texture](Texture.html) and
[AssetBundle](AssetBundle.html) downloads.  
  
For custom use cases, see
[DownloadHandlerScript](Networking.DownloadHandlerScript.html).
