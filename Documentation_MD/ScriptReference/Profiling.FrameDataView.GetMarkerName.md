## Declaration

public string GetMarkerName(int markerId);

### Parameters

markerId | Marker identifier.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**string** Returns marker name. Returns _null_ if identifier is unknown.

### Description

Gets Profiler marker name for the specific marker identifier.

The Profiler uses unique identifier for each marker created during profiling
session. Marker can generate many samples which
[HierarchyFrameDataView](Profiling.HierarchyFrameDataView.html) and
[RawFrameDataView](Profiling.RawFrameDataView.html) provide access for.  
All samples generated by the same marker have the same integer marker
identifier and the same name.  
  
Marker identifiers are persistent for the entire profiling session.  
  
**Throws:**  
_System.ArgumentException_ if _markerId_ is invalid.
