public [Vector3](Vector3.html) size;

### Description

The total size of the box. This is always twice as large as the
[extents](Bounds-extents.html).

_size.x_ is the width, _size.y_ is the height and _size.z_ is the depth of the
box. Note that _size_ is given in world size. A Bound surrounding a tall human
might have _size.y_ approximately 2.0f, meaning a 2 meter height body.

    
    
    //This script outputs the size of the [Collider](Collider.html) bounds to the console  
      
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        [Collider](Collider.html) m_Collider;
        [Vector3](Vector3.html) m_Size;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            //Fetch the [Collider](Collider.html) from the [GameObject](GameObject.html)
            m_Collider = GetComponent<[Collider](Collider.html)>();  
      
            //Fetch the size of the [Collider](Collider.html) volume
            m_Size = m_Collider.bounds.size;  
      
            //Output to the console the size of the [Collider](Collider.html) volume
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("[Collider](Collider.html) Size : " + m_Size);
        }
    }
