### Description

Provides a view on a buffer of native memory most commonly acquired from a
[NativeArray<T0>](Unity.Collections.NativeArray_1.html).

A NativeSlice provides systems that means they can be used safely with jobs.
In contrast to a [NativeArray<T0>](Unity.Collections.NativeArray_1.html), a
NativeSlice doesn't own any memory allocations and can't be disposed. A
NativeSlice supports a stride value and doesn't necessarily represent a
contiguous memory range. The stride value determines the number of bytes from
the first byte of the element to the first byte of the next element. The
stride value must always be a multiple of the size of the type of the slice in
bytes. The stride value allows you to skip elements from the underlying
buffer. By default, the stride is set to the size of the type of slice in
bytes. This means that the slice represents a contiguous memory range. If you
don't need a stride and are only working with contiguous memory ranges, use
[NativeArray<T0>](Unity.Collections.NativeArray_1.html) instead.

### Properties

[Length](Unity.Collections.NativeSlice_1.Length.html)| Represents the number
of elements in a NativeSlice<T0>.  
---|---  
[Stride](Unity.Collections.NativeSlice_1.Stride.html)| Gets the stride value
for the NativeSlice<T0> instance.  
[this[int]](Unity.Collections.NativeSlice_1.Index_operator.html)| Accesses
NativeSlice<T0> elements by index.  
  
### Constructors

[NativeSlice_1](Unity.Collections.NativeSlice_1-ctor.html)| Constructs a new
NativeSlice from a NativeArray or NativeSlice.  
---|---  
  
### Public Methods

[CopyFrom](Unity.Collections.NativeSlice_1.CopyFrom.html)| Copies all the
elements from a NativeSlice<T0> or managed array of the same length.  
---|---  
[CopyTo](Unity.Collections.NativeSlice_1.CopyTo.html)| Copies all the elements
of a NativeSlice<T0> to a NativeArray<T0> or managed array of the same length.  
[GetEnumerator](Unity.Collections.NativeSlice_1.GetEnumerator.html)| Gets an
enumerator to iterate through the elements of a NativeSlice<T0>.  
[SliceConvert](Unity.Collections.NativeSlice_1.SliceConvert.html)|
Reinterprets a NativeSlice with a different data type (type punning).  
[SliceWithStride](Unity.Collections.NativeSlice_1.SliceWithStride.html)|
SliceWithStride.  
[ToArray](Unity.Collections.NativeSlice_1.ToArray.html)| Converts a
NativeSlice<T0> to managed array.  
  
### Operators

[NativeSlice<T>](Unity.Collections.NativeSlice_1-operator_NativeArrayT.html)|
Implicit operator to create a NativeSlice<T0> from a NativeArray<T0>.
