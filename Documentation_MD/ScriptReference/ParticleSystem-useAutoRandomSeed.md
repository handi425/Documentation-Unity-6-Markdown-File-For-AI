Component in the Manual")

public bool useAutoRandomSeed;

### Description

Controls whether the Particle System uses an automatically-generated random
number to seed the random number generator.

If set to true, the Particle System will generate a new random seed each time
it is played. If set to false, [ParticleSystem.randomSeed](ParticleSystem-
randomSeed.html) will be used instead, allowing for a constant seed (useful if
you want your particles to play in exactly the same way each time) or user-
defined random value (for example, you may want to cycle through an array of
seeds).

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
**Known Issue**. Please check with the Issue Tracker at
