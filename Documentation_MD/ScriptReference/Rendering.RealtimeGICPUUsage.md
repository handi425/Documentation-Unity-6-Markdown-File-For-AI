### Description

How much CPU usage to assign to the final lighting calculations at runtime.

How many CPU worker threads to create for Enlighten Realtime Global
Illumination lighting calculations in the Player. Increasing this makes the
system react faster to changes in lighting at a cost of using more CPU time.
The higher the CPU Usage value, the more worker threads are created for
solving Enlighten Realtime Global Illumination.  
  
**Please note** that some platforms will allow all CPUs to be occupied by
worker threads whilst some have a max limit:  
**Android:** If the device is a bigLittle architecture, only the little CPUs
will be used, otherwise it is CPUs - 1.  

### Properties

[Low](Rendering.RealtimeGICPUUsage.Low.html)| 25% of the allowed CPU threads
are used as worker threads.  
---|---  
[Medium](Rendering.RealtimeGICPUUsage.Medium.html)| 50% of the allowed CPU
threads are used as worker threads.  
[High](Rendering.RealtimeGICPUUsage.High.html)| 75% of the allowed CPU threads
are used as worker threads.  
[Unlimited](Rendering.RealtimeGICPUUsage.Unlimited.html)| 100% of the allowed
CPU threads are used as worker threads.
