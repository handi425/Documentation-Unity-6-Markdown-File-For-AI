## Declaration

public static string
GetApplicationIdentifier([Build.NamedBuildTarget](Build.NamedBuildTarget.html)
buildTarget);

### Parameters

buildTarget | The [NamedBuildTarget](Build.NamedBuildTarget.html).  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**string** Returns the application identifier associated with a
[NamedBuildTarget](Build.NamedBuildTarget.html).

### Description

Get the application identifier for the specified platform.

The location of the application identifier in the build output depends on the
platform build target. On iOS, tvOS and Mac OS X platforms, the identifier is
written to the 'CFBundleIdentifier' field in the info.plist file. This file is
created and placed in the build output folder when the Unity project is built.
Additionally, on Mac OS X, the bundle identifier can be found in the
info.plist file in the final .app file, after finishing the Xcode build
process. On Android the identifier is saved to the 'package' field in the
AndroidManifest.xml file.

**Obsolete** Use GetApplicationIdentifier(NamedBuildTarget buildTarget)
instead.

## Declaration

public static string
GetApplicationIdentifier([BuildTargetGroup](BuildTargetGroup.html)
targetGroup);

### Description

BuildTargetGroup is marked for deprecation in the future. Use
[NamedBuildTarget](Build.NamedBuildTarget.html) instead.
