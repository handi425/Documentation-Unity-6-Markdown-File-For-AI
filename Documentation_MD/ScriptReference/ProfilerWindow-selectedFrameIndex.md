public long selectedFrameIndex;

### Description

The zero-based index of the frame currently selected in the Profiler Window.

To change the currently selected frame in the Profiler window, set this index
to any value between and including
[ProfilerWindow.firstAvailableFrameIndex](ProfilerWindow-
firstAvailableFrameIndex.html) and
[ProfilerWindow.lastAvailableFrameIndex](ProfilerWindow-
lastAvailableFrameIndex.html). When this property is set to a value outside of
that range, or smaller than 0, Unity will throw an
ArgumentOutOfRangeException.  
  
If no frames are shown in the Profiler Window this index will be -1.  
  
Note: Since the Profiler Window shows the current selected frame as a 1 based
index, this value will be n-1 of whatever the value the Profiler Window shows.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
