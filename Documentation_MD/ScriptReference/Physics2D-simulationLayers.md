public static [LayerMask](LayerMask.html) simulationLayers;

### Description

The [Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) and [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) layers
to simulate.

By default, [All Layers](Physics2D.AllLayers.html) are simulated, however if
you specify layers in this property then only the
[Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) on those layers will be simulated. Along with
this, only contacts for [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) on the specified
layer(s) will be handled. Finally, only [joints](Joint2D.html) or
[effectors](Effector2D.html) on the specified layer(s) will be handled.  
  
This property is only used when the Physics2D.SimulationMode is in one of the
automatic simulation modes i.e.
[SimulationMode2D.FixedUpdate](SimulationMode2D.FixedUpdate.html) or
[SimulationMode2D.Update](SimulationMode2D.Update.html). When using
[SimulationMode2D.Script](SimulationMode2D.Script.html) and calling
[Physics2D.Simulate](Physics2D.Simulate.html), the simulation layers are pass
as an argument.  
  
Additional resources:
[Physics2D.simulationMode](Physics2D-simulationMode.html) and
[Physics2D.Simulate](Physics2D.Simulate.html).
