## Declaration

public static void ExitGUI();

### Description

Puts the GUI in a state that will prevent all subsequent immediate mode GUI
functions from evaluating for the remainder of the GUI loop by throwing an
[ExitGUIException](ExitGUIException.html).

In Unity's immediate mode GUI system, the GUI loop procedes by calling
[GUI](GUI.html) methods during a sequence of [Event](Event.html)s and these
methods take action according to the [Event.type](Event-type.html). For
example, when using [GUILayout](GUILayout.html), controls will first receive a
[EventType.Layout](EventType.Layout.html) event to determine how much space
they need, and then later receive a
[EventType.Repaint](EventType.Repaint.html) event to actually draw into the
space allocated for them.  
  
In this sequence, it is expected that control IDs are requested and used in
the same order for each [Event](Event.html) that is processed during the GUI
loop, and that the event loop does not re-enter itself. Use
[GUIUtility.ExitGUI](GUIUtility.ExitGUI.html) in situations that might violate
these assumptions, such as when a change in some value might change what
controls are displayed next. Using this method can prevent errors such as
`ArgumentException: Getting control 0's position in a group with only 0
controls when doing Repaint`.
