motionVectorMode;

### Description

Motion vector mode.

Unity configures the following built-in shader uniforms to calculate motion
vectors in HLSL code: `unity_MotionVectorsParams`, `unity_MatrixPreviousM` and
`unity_MatrixPreviousMI`.  
  
For ray tracing instances, `unity_MotionVectorsParams` is a vector uniform.
Its component values are as follows:

  * the x and z components are 0
  * the y component is 0 if the motion vector mode is [MotionVectorGenerationMode.ForceNoMotion](MotionVectorGenerationMode.ForceNoMotion.html). Otherwise it is 1.
  * the w component is 0 if the motion vector mode is [MotionVectorGenerationMode.Camera](MotionVectorGenerationMode.Camera.html). Otherwise it is 1.

`unity_MatrixPreviousM` and `unity_MatrixPreviousMI` are the instance matrix
and its inverse respectively used in the previous frame. Note that Unity only
updates these matrices only when there's a [Camera](Camera.html) in the Scene
that's using the
[DepthTextureMode.MotionVectors](DepthTextureMode.MotionVectors.html) flag in
[Camera.depthTextureMode](Camera-depthTextureMode.html).  
  
To access the ray tracing instance matrix in closest hit, any hit, and
intersection shaders, use the `ObjectToWorld` or `WorldToObject` HLSL
functions.
