## Declaration

public void
ConfigureTarget([Rendering.RenderTargetIdentifier](Rendering.RenderTargetIdentifier.html)
target, bool loadExistingContents, bool storeResults);

### Parameters

tgt | The surface to use as the backing storage for this AttachmentDescriptor.  
---|---  
loadExistingContents | Whether to read in the existing contents of the surface when the RenderPass starts.  
storeResults | Whether to store the rendering results of the attachment when the RenderPass ends.  
  
### Description

Binds this AttachmentDescriptor to the given target surface.

This method sets the backing storage of this AttachmentDescriptor to the given
target surface.  
  
If loadExistingContents is true, changes
[loadAction](Rendering.AttachmentDescriptor-loadAction.html) to
RenderBufferStoreAction.Load unless the load action is already set to
RenderBufferStoreAction.Clear, in which case this parameter is ignored.  
  
If `storeResults` is true, changes
[storeAction](Rendering.AttachmentDescriptor-storeAction.html) to either
[RenderBufferStoreAction.Store](Rendering.RenderBufferStoreAction.Store.html)
or
[RenderBufferStoreAction.StoreAndResolve](Rendering.RenderBufferStoreAction.StoreAndResolve.html)
depending on whether the `resolveAttachment` was configured or not.  
  
Note: If you call both
[ConfigureResolveTarget](Rendering.AttachmentDescriptor.ConfigureResolveTarget.html)
with `storeResults` set to `true` and `ConfigureTarget`, Unity stores both the
resolved and unresolved MSAA surfaces respectively in `resolveTarget` and
`loadStoreTarget`. This means Unity writes more data to memory.
