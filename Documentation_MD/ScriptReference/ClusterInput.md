### Description

Interface for reading and writing inputs in a Unity Cluster.

ClusterInput provides access to VRPN devices by connecting to a VRPN server.
It also provides access to writeable inputs. All inputs managed by
ClusterInput will be replicated to the rest of the connected slaves in the
cluster. Using ClusterInput is much like using the traditional Input system in
Unity.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            // Buttons and [Axis](Animations.Axis.html) provide a single value.
            bool buttonValue = ClusterInput.GetButton("button1");
            float axisValue = ClusterInput.GetAxis("axis1");  
      
            // A tracker provides 2 values, rotation and position.
            [Vector3](Vector3.html) position = ClusterInput.GetTrackerPosition("tracker1");
            [Quaternion](Quaternion.html) rotation = ClusterInput.GetTrackerRotation("tracker1");  
      
            if (ClusterNetwork.isMasterOfCluster)
            {
                float axisValueCustom = MyCustomDevicePlugin.GetValue("myaxis");
                ClusterInput.SetAxis("customAxis", axisValueCustom);
            }
        }
    }
