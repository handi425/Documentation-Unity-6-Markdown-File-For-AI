## Declaration

public static void ComputeHash128(void* data, ulong dataSize, ulong* hash1,
ulong* hash2);

## Declaration

public static void ComputeHash128(void* data, ulong dataSize, Hash128* hash);

### Parameters

data | Pointer to the data to hash.  
---|---  
dataSize | The number of bytes to hash.  
hash1 | A pointer to store the low 64 bits of the computed hash.  
hash2 | A pointer to store the high 64 bits of the computed hash.  
hash | A pointer to the Hash128 to updated with the computed hash.  
  
### Description

Compute a 128 bit hash based on a data.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class HashUtilitiesSample
    {
        public void ComputeHash128_ToULong()

            unsafe
            {
                ulong* message = stackalloc ulong[2];
                message[0] = 0x73BC2A67F;
                message[1] = 0x54B1A5C2C;  
      
                ulong h1 = 0;
                ulong h2 = 0;  
      
                [HashUnsafeUtilities.ComputeHash128](HashUnsafeUtilities.ComputeHash128.html)(message, sizeof(ulong) * 2, &h1, &h2);
            }
