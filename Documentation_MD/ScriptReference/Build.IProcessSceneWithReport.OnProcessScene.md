## Declaration

public void OnProcessScene([SceneManagement.Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html)
scene, [Build.Reporting.BuildReport](Build.Reporting.BuildReport.html)
report);

### Parameters

scene | The current Scene being processed.  
---|---  
report | A report containing information about the current build. When this callback is invoked for Scene loading during Editor playmode, this parameter will be null.  
  
### Description

Implement this function to receive a callback for each Scene during the build.

This callback is invoked during Player and AssetBundle builds, and also as a
scene is reloaded while entering Editor playmode.
[BuildPipeline.isBuildingPlayer](BuildPipeline-isBuildingPlayer.html) can be
used to determine in which context the callback is being called.
