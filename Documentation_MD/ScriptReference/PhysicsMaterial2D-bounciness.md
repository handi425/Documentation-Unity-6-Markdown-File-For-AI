public float bounciness;

### Description

Coefficient of restitution.

Restitution (bounciness) is used to control how "elastic" a collision response
is. A value of zero indicates no bounce at all while a value of one indicates
perfect elasticity (approximately).  
  
**Note:** Values higher than one are allowed but will add "energy" to the
collision response. Use caution, as this can cause a
[Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) to move quickly without limit, leading to
simulation problems.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
**Known Issue**. Please check with the Issue Tracker at
