## Declaration

public static void DrawTextureWithTexCoords([Rect](Rect.html) position,
[Texture](Texture.html) image, [Rect](Rect.html) texCoords);

## Declaration

public static void DrawTextureWithTexCoords([Rect](Rect.html) position,
[Texture](Texture.html) image, [Rect](Rect.html) texCoords, bool alphaBlend);

### Parameters

position | Rectangle on the screen to draw the texture within.  
---|---  
image |  [Texture](Texture.html) to display.  
texCoords | How to scale the image when the aspect ratio of it doesn't fit the aspect ratio to be drawn within.  
alphaBlend | Whether to alpha blend the image on to the display (the default). If false, the picture is drawn on to the display.  
  
### Description

Draw a texture within a rectangle with the given texture coordinates.

Use this function for clipping or tiling the image within the given rectangle.
The second [Rect](Rect.html) `texCoords` describes how the texture is adjusted
to fit the position [Rect](Rect.html). The first rectangle has its size in
pixels provided; the second rectangle is given in a 0.0 to 1.0 range.

contentColor.html).

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    // Use DrawTextureWithTexCoords() to draw a texture.  The texture is draw on the window
    // inside a given pixel rectangle.  The size of the drawn texture is based on the value
    // of hor.  This ranges from 0.5 to 1.25 so the bottom left half of the texture to a
    // greater than normal value.

        private float hor;

            label = new [Rect](Rect.html)(center - 20, 155, 50, 30);
            hor = 0.5f;

            [GUI.Label](GUI.Label.html)(label, hor.ToString("F3"));
            [GUI.DrawTextureWithTexCoords](GUI.DrawTextureWithTexCoords.html)(rect, tex, new [Rect](Rect.html)(0.0f, 0.0f, hor, hor));
