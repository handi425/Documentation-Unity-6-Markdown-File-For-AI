## Declaration

public static AssetBundleBuild[] GenerateAssetBundleBuilds();

### Description

Returns an array of AssetBundleBuild structs that detail the current
AssetBundle layout, as set through the Inspector and stored in the
AssetDatabase.

This API does not generate a build, instead it is a convenient function to
populate the build definition into the format expected by some signatures of
[BuildPipeline.BuildAssetBundles](BuildPipeline.BuildAssetBundles.html), or
the Scriptable Build Pipeline.
