Component in the Manual")

public static int asyncUploadTimeSlice;

### Description

Async texture upload provides timesliced async texture upload on the render
thread with tight control over memory and timeslicing. There are no
allocations except for the ones which driver has to do. To read data and
upload texture data a ringbuffer whose size can be controlled is re-used.  
  
Use asyncUploadTimeSlice to set the time-slice in milliseconds for
asynchronous texture uploads per frame. Minimum value is 1 and maximum is 33.

Upload](../Manual/LoadingTextureandMeshData.html), [Quality
Settings](../Manual/class-QualitySettings.html).
