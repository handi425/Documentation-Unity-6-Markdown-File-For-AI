### Description

The collision detection mode constants used for
[Rigidbody.collisionDetectionMode](Rigidbody-collisionDetectionMode.html).

    
    
    //This script allows you to switch collision detection mode at the press of the space key, and move your [GameObject](GameObject.html). It also outputs collisions that occur to the console.
    //Attach this script to a [GameObject](GameObject.html) and make sure it has a [Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html) component
    //If it doesn't have a [Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html) component, click the [GameObject](GameObject.html), go to its Inspector and click the **Add Component** button. Then, go to **Physics** >**Rigidbody**.
    //Create another [GameObject](GameObject.html). Make sure it has a [Collider](Collider.html), so you can test collisions between them.

### Properties

[Discrete](CollisionDetectionMode.Discrete.html)| Continuous collision
detection is off for this Rigidbody.  
---|---  
[Continuous](CollisionDetectionMode.Continuous.html)| Continuous collision
detection is on for colliding with static mesh geometry.  
[ContinuousDynamic](CollisionDetectionMode.ContinuousDynamic.html)| Continuous
collision detection is on for colliding with static and dynamic geometry.  
[ContinuousSpeculative](CollisionDetectionMode.ContinuousSpeculative.html)|
Speculative continuous collision detection is on for static and dynamic
geometries
