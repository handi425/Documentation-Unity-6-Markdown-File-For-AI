public float shadowNormalBias;

### Description

Shadow mapping normal-based bias.

Shadow caster surfaces are pushed inwards along their normals by this amount,
to help prevent self-shadowing ("shadow acne") artifacts. Units of normal-
based bias are expressed in terms of shadowmap texel size; typically values
between 0.3-0.7 work well.  
  
Larger values prevent shadow acne better, at expense of making shadow shape
smaller than the object actually is.  
  
Currently normal-based bias is only implemented for directional lights; it has
no effect for other light types.

shadowBias.html) properties.
