## Declaration

public static CoveredMethodStats[] GetStatsForAllCoveredMethods();

### Returns

**CoveredMethodStats[]** Array of coverage summaries.

### Description

Returns the coverage summary for all methods that have been called since
either the Unity process was started or Coverage.ResetAll() has been called.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.TestTools;  
      
    // A simple test class to get coverage information for.
    public class CoverageClass
    {
        public bool CoveredMethod1()
        {
            return true;
        }  
      
        public bool CoveredMethod2()
        {
            return false;
        }
    }  
      
    public class CoverageExample : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            // Reset coverage
            [Coverage.ResetAll](TestTools.Coverage.ResetAll.html)();  
      
            // Create an instance of the test class and call both test methods
            // to make sure the class has had some coverage.
            CoverageClass coverageClasss = new CoverageClass();
            coverageClasss.CoveredMethod1();
            coverageClasss.CoveredMethod2();  
      
            // Now get coverage statistics for all covered methods. Note that this
            // will return statistics for all methods that have executed since [Coverage.ResetAll](TestTools.Coverage.ResetAll.html)()
            // was last called, i.e. this method (CoverageExample.Start()), CoverageClass.CoveredMethod1(),
            // and CoverageClass.CoveredMethod2().
            [CoveredMethodStats](TestTools.CoveredMethodStats.html)[] stats = [Coverage.GetStatsForAllCoveredMethods](TestTools.Coverage.GetStatsForAllCoveredMethods.html)();  
      
            for (int i = 0; i < stats.Length; i++)
            {
                [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("Method Name: " + stats[i].method.ToString());
                [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("Method has " + stats[i].totalSequencePoints + " sequence points");
                int coveredSequencePoints = stats[i].totalSequencePoints - stats[i].uncoveredSequencePoints;
                [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("of which " + coveredSequencePoints + " were covered.");
            }
        }
    }
