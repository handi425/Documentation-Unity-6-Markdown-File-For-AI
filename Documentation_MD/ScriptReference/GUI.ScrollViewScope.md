### Description

Disposable helper class for managing
[BeginScrollView](GUI.BeginScrollView.html) /
[EndScrollView](GUI.EndScrollView.html).

[BeginScrollView](GUI.BeginScrollView.html) is called at construction, and
[EndScrollView](GUI.EndScrollView.html) is called when the instance is
disposed. ScrollViews let you make a smaller area on-screen look 'into' a much
larger area, using scrollbars placed on the sides of the ScrollView.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        // The position of the scrolling viewport
        public [Vector2](Vector2.html) scrollPosition = [Vector2.zero](Vector2-zero.html);
        void OnGUI()
        {
            // An absolute-positioned example: We make a scrollview that has a really large client
            // rect and put it in a small rect on the screen.
            using (var scrollScope = new [GUI.ScrollViewScope](GUI.ScrollViewScope.html)(new [Rect](Rect.html)(10, 300, 100, 100), scrollPosition, new [Rect](Rect.html)(0, 0, 220, 200)))
            {
                scrollPosition = scrollScope.scrollPosition;  
      
                // Make four buttons - one in each corner. The coordinate system is defined
                // by the last parameter to the ScrollScope constructor.
                [GUI.Button](GUI.Button.html)(new [Rect](Rect.html)(0, 0, 100, 20), "Top-left");
                [GUI.Button](GUI.Button.html)(new [Rect](Rect.html)(120, 0, 100, 20), "Top-right");
                [GUI.Button](GUI.Button.html)(new [Rect](Rect.html)(0, 180, 100, 20), "Bottom-left");
                [GUI.Button](GUI.Button.html)(new [Rect](Rect.html)(120, 180, 100, 20), "Bottom-right");
            }
            // Now the scroll view is ended.
        }
    }
