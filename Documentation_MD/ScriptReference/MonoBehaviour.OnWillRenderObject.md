[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-MonoBehaviour.html "Go to MonoBehaviour
Component in the Manual")

### Description

OnWillRenderObject is called for each camera if the object is visible and not
a UI element.

The function is not called if the MonoBehaviour is disabled.  
  
The function is called during the culling process just before rendering each
culled object.  
  
Note that [Camera.current](Camera-current.html) will be set to the camera that
will render the object.  
  
**Note:** This has no effect when called from a UI element.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleScript : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public [Renderer](Renderer.html) rend;  
      
        private float timePass = 0.0f;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            rend = GetComponent<[Renderer](Renderer.html)>();
        }  
      
        void OnWillRenderObject()
        {
            timePass += [Time.deltaTime](Time-deltaTime.html);  
      
            if (timePass > 1.0f)
            {
                timePass = 0.0f;
                print(gameObject.name + " is being rendered by " + Camera.current.name + " at " + [Time.time](Time-time.html));
            }
        }
    }
    

This is called multiple times per frame.
