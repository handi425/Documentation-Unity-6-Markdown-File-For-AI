### Description

The emissive lighting will affect Enlighten Realtime Global Illumination. It
emits lighting into real-time lightmaps and real-time Light Probes.

The flags are mutually exclusive so if you are using real-time Emissive
lighting, you must remove the EmissiveIsBlack flag from the material as shown
in the example below.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        [Material](Material.html) material;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            // Remove the EmissiveIsBlack flag from material:
            [MaterialGlobalIlluminationFlags](MaterialGlobalIlluminationFlags.html) flags = material.globalIlluminationFlags;
            flags &= ~[MaterialGlobalIlluminationFlags.EmissiveIsBlack](MaterialGlobalIlluminationFlags.EmissiveIsBlack.html);
            material.globalIlluminationFlags = flags;
        }
    }
