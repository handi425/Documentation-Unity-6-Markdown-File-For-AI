public static bool preventCrossSceneReferences;

### Description

Controls whether cross-Scene references are allowed in the Editor.

A cross-Scene reference occurs when you have multiple Scenes loaded in the
Editor, and a component attached to a GameObject in one Scene has a reference
to a GameObject in another Scene.  
  
The default value for this setting is 'true'. This means that by default, you
cannot create cross-Scene references in the Unity Editor.  
  
This is prevented by default because cross-Scene references cannot be saved in
Scene files. Therefore, having the Editor prevent you from creating these
references avoids potential situations where your assignments cannot be saved.
If you need cross-Scene references at runtime, you need to create those
references at runtime - finding the GameObjects by values such as name or tag.  
  
There are, however, certain situations where you may need to create cross-
Scene references in the Editor, even though these references cannot be saved -
for example, if you needed to create an Editor script which should be able to
operate on GameObjects from many Scenes at once. Deactivating this setting
allows you to do this.  
  
Note however that deactivating this value does not mean cross-Scene references
will be saved.  
  
Disabling this setting means that:  
  
1) Dragging references from a GameObject in one Scene to another GameObject's
Component field in a different Scene is allowed.  
2) The Object Picker (the small target icon next to most assignable fields in
the Inspector) lists choices from all open Scenes, instead of just the
GameObject's own Scene.  
3) Dragging GameObjects from one Scene to another Scene can result in cross-
Scene references. Warnings are no longer logged when this happens.
