### Description

Callback invoked when the first scene's objects are loaded into memory but
**before** Awake has been called.

For more info on ordering see
[RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethodAttribute](RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethodAttribute.html).

    
    
    // Demonstration of the [RuntimeInitializeLoadType.BeforeSceneLoad](RuntimeInitializeLoadType.BeforeSceneLoad.html) attribute to find inactive objects before Awake has been 
    // called for the first scene being loaded. Then from these inactive objects we find which ones will be active after Awake is called later.
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    class MyClass
    {
        [RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethod([RuntimeInitializeLoadType.BeforeSceneLoad](RuntimeInitializeLoadType.BeforeSceneLoad.html))]
        private static void FirstSceneLoading()
        {
            var components = UnityEngine.Object.FindObjectsByType(typeof([MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)), [FindObjectsInactive.Include](FindObjectsInactive.Include.html), [FindObjectsSortMode.None](FindObjectsSortMode.None.html));
            var willBeActiveAfterSceneLoad = 0;
            foreach (var c in components)
            {
                if (WillBeActiveAfterSceneLoad((([Component](Component.html))c).gameObject))
                    willBeActiveAfterSceneLoad++;
            }
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("BeforeSceneLoad. Will be Active after Awake, count: " + willBeActiveAfterSceneLoad);
        }  
      
        static bool WillBeActiveAfterSceneLoad([GameObject](GameObject.html) gameObject)
        {
            [Transform](Transform.html) current = gameObject.transform;
            while (current != null)
            {
                if (!current.gameObject.activeSelf)
                    return false;  
      
                current = current.parent;
            }  
      
            return true;
        }
    }
