### Description

Draw commands generated by the culling request.

### Properties

[drawCommandCount](Rendering.BatchCullingOutputDrawCommands-
drawCommandCount.html)| The number of elements in the
BatchCullingOutputDrawCommands.drawCommands array.  
---|---  
[drawCommandPickingInstanceIDs](Rendering.BatchCullingOutputDrawCommands-
drawCommandPickingInstanceIDs.html)| The instance IDs that are associated with
the draw commands.  
[drawCommands](Rendering.BatchCullingOutputDrawCommands-drawCommands.html)|
The array that contains draw commands to render as the result of the
OnPerformCulling call.  
[drawRangeCount](Rendering.BatchCullingOutputDrawCommands-
drawRangeCount.html)| The number of elements in the
BatchCullingOutputDrawCommands.drawRanges array.  
[drawRanges](Rendering.BatchCullingOutputDrawCommands-drawRanges.html)|
Contains filtering settings for draw commands, which tell Unity in which
conditions it should render a given draw command.  
[indirectDrawCommandCount](Rendering.BatchCullingOutputDrawCommands-
indirectDrawCommandCount.html)| The number of elements in the
BatchCullingOutputDrawCommands.indirectDrawCommands array.  
[indirectDrawCommands](Rendering.BatchCullingOutputDrawCommands-
indirectDrawCommands.html)| The array that contains indirect draw commands to
render as the result of the OnPerformCulling call.  
[instanceSortingPositionFloatCount](Rendering.BatchCullingOutputDrawCommands-
instanceSortingPositionFloatCount.html)| If
BatchDrawCommandFlags.HasSortingPosition is set for one or more draw commands,
this contains float3 world-space positions that Unity uses for depth sorting.  
[instanceSortingPositions](Rendering.BatchCullingOutputDrawCommands-
instanceSortingPositions.html)| If BatchDrawCommandFlags.HasSortingPosition is
set for one or more draw commands, the instanceSortingPositions array contains
explicit float3 world space positions that Unity uses for depth sorting.The
culling callback must allocate the memory for the instanceSortingPositions
using the UnsafeUtility.Malloc method and the Allocator.TempJob parameter. The
memory is released by Unity when the rendering is complete.If the length of
the array is 0, set its value to null.  
[proceduralDrawCommandCount](Rendering.BatchCullingOutputDrawCommands-
proceduralDrawCommandCount.html)| The number of elements in the
BatchCullingOutputDrawCommands.proceduralDrawCommands array.  
[proceduralDrawCommands](Rendering.BatchCullingOutputDrawCommands-
proceduralDrawCommands.html)| The array that contains procedural draw commands
to render as the result of the OnPerformCulling call.  
[proceduralIndirectDrawCommandCount](Rendering.BatchCullingOutputDrawCommands-
proceduralIndirectDrawCommandCount.html)| The number of elements in the
BatchCullingOutputDrawCommands.proceduralIndirectDrawCommands array.  
[proceduralIndirectDrawCommands](Rendering.BatchCullingOutputDrawCommands-
proceduralIndirectDrawCommands.html)| The array that contains procedural
indirect draw commands to render as the result of the OnPerformCulling call.  
[visibleInstanceCount](Rendering.BatchCullingOutputDrawCommands-
visibleInstanceCount.html)| The number of elements in the
BatchCullingOutputDrawCommands.visibleInstances array.  
[visibleInstances](Rendering.BatchCullingOutputDrawCommands-
visibleInstances.html)| The indices of visible instances to render.
