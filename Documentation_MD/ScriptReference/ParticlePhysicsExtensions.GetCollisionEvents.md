## Declaration

public static int GetCollisionEvents([ParticleSystem](ParticleSystem.html) ps,
[GameObject](GameObject.html) go, List<ParticleCollisionEvent>
collisionEvents);

### Parameters

go | The GameObject for which to retrieve collision events.  
---|---  
collisionEvents | Array to write collision events to.  
ps | The Particle System that owns the potentially colliding particles.  
  
### Returns

**int** The number of collision events.

### Description

Get the particle collision events for a GameObject. Returns the number of
events written to the array.

This method is typically called from
[MonoBehaviour.OnParticleCollision](MonoBehaviour.OnParticleCollision.html) in
response to a collision callback.  
  
If the array used is too short, the list of collision events will be
truncated. This means you will not have every event that occurred. To avoid
this use
[ParticlePhysicsExtensions.GetSafeCollisionEventSize](ParticlePhysicsExtensions.GetSafeCollisionEventSize.html)
to determine an appropriate array size prior the call.  
  
Additional resources:
[MonoBehaviour.OnParticleCollision](MonoBehaviour.OnParticleCollision.html).

**Obsolete** GetCollisionEvents function using ParticleCollisionEvent[] is
deprecated. Use List<ParticleCollisionEvent> instead.

## Declaration

public static int GetCollisionEvents([ParticleSystem](ParticleSystem.html) ps,
[GameObject](GameObject.html) go, ParticleCollisionEvent[] collisionEvents);

### Description

Deprecated: Use the overload that takes a List. That overload doesn't create
garbage.
