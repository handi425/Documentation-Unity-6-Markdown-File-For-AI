public float inTangent;

### Description

Sets the incoming tangent for this key. The incoming tangent affects the slope
of the curve from the previous key to this key.

The incoming tangent matches the incoming slope of the curve. A positive value
for [inTangent](Keyframe-inTangent.html) results in a downward tangent, while
a negative value results in an upward tangent.  
  
Additional resources: [outTangent](Keyframe-outTangent.html).
