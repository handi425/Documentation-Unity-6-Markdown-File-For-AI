## Declaration

public static int DisplayDialogComplex(string title, string message, string
ok, string cancel, string alt);

### Parameters

title | Title for dialog.  
---|---  
message | Purpose for the dialog.  
ok | Dialog function chosen.  
cancel | Close dialog with no operation.  
alt | Choose alternative dialog purpose.  
  
### Returns

**int** Returns the ID of a button. IDs are 0, 1, or 2 and they correspond to
the `ok`, `cancel` and `alt` buttons respectively. An ID of 1, which
corresponds to `cancel`, returns if the dialog is closed or the user presses
the Escape key.

### Description

Displays a modal dialog with three buttons.

Use it for displaying message boxes in the Editor.  
  
`DisplayDialogComplex` is similar to
[DisplayDialog](EditorUtility.DisplayDialog.html). This `DisplayDialogComplex`
member shows a dialog with three buttons. These buttons represent `ok`,
`cancel` and `alt`. `DisplayDialogComplex` returns an integer 0, 1 or 2
corresponding to the `ok`, `cancel` and `alt` buttons.  
  
The `ok` button is the default option, and can also be activated by pressing
Enter.  
  
The `cancel` button is considered the "cancel" button and should usually not
perform any action. On a PC, this can also be activated by pressing Escape or
by clicking the dialog window close button. On a Mac, this can also be
activated by pressing Escape, provided the button is called "Cancel".  
  
The `alt` button allows you to provide the user with an alternative choice in
addition to the `ok` and `cancel` buttons. This button does not have a fixed
keyboard shortcut.  
  
For compliance with platform UI guidelines, the actual display order of the
buttons is platform-dependent:

  * On Windows, the display order is: `ok`, `alt`, then `cancel`.
  * On macOS, the display order is: `alt`, `cancel`, then `ok`.

The script reference example below creates a complex display dialog. The
chosen button causes a Unity [EditorApplication](EditorApplication.html)
static function to be called.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);  
      
    public class DisplayDlgComplexExample : [EditorWindow](EditorWindow.html)
    {
        // Lets you save or not before quitting, or cancel.  
      
        [[MenuItem](MenuItem.html)("Example/Quit")]
        static void Init()
        {
            int option = [EditorUtility.DisplayDialogComplex](EditorUtility.DisplayDialogComplex.html)("Unsaved Changes",
                "Do you want to save the changes you made before quitting?",
                "Save",
                "Cancel",
                "Don't Save");  
      
            switch (option)
            {
                // Save.
                case 0:
                    EditorApplication.SaveScene(EditorApplication.currentScene);
                    [EditorApplication.Exit](EditorApplication.Exit.html)(0);
                    break;  
      
                // Cancel.
                case 1:
                    break;  
      
                // Don't Save.
                case 2:
                    [EditorApplication.Exit](EditorApplication.Exit.html)(0);
                    break;  
      
                default:
                    [Debug.LogError](Debug.LogError.html)("Unrecognized option.");
                    break;
            }
        }
    }
