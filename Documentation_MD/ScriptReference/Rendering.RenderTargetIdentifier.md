### Description

Identifies a [RenderTexture](RenderTexture.html) for a
[CommandBuffer](Rendering.CommandBuffer.html).

Render textures can be identified in a number of ways, for example a
[RenderTexture](RenderTexture.html) object, or one of built-in render textures
([BuiltinRenderTextureType](Rendering.BuiltinRenderTextureType.html)), or a
temporary render texture with a name (that was created using
[CommandBuffer.GetTemporaryRT](Rendering.CommandBuffer.GetTemporaryRT.html)).  
  
This struct serves as a way to identify them, and has implicit conversion
operators so that in most cases you can save some typing.  
  
Additional resources: [CommandBuffer](Rendering.CommandBuffer.html).

### Static Properties

[AllDepthSlices](Rendering.RenderTargetIdentifier.AllDepthSlices.html)| All
depth-slices of the render resource are bound for rendering. For textures
which are neither array nor 3D, the default slice is bound.  
---|---  
  
### Constructors

[RenderTargetIdentifier](Rendering.RenderTargetIdentifier-ctor.html)| Creates
a render target identifier.
