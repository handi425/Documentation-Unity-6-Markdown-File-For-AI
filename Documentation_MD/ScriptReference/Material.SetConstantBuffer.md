## Declaration

public void SetConstantBuffer(int nameID,
[GraphicsBuffer](GraphicsBuffer.html) value, int offset, int size);

### Parameters

name | The name of the constant buffer to override.  
---|---  
value | The ComputeBuffer to override the constant buffer values with, or null to remove binding.  
offset | Offset in bytes from the beginning of the buffer to bind. Must be a multiple of [SystemInfo.constantBufferOffsetAlignment](SystemInfo-constantBufferOffsetAlignment.html), or 0 if that value is 0.  
size | The number of bytes to bind.  
nameID | The shader property ID of the constant buffer to override.  
  
### Description

Sets a [ComputeBuffer](ComputeBuffer.html) or
[GraphicsBuffer](GraphicsBuffer.html) as a named constant buffer for the
material.

You can use this method to override all of the parameters in a shader constant
buffer with the contents of a [ComputeBuffer](ComputeBuffer.html) or
[GraphicsBuffer](GraphicsBuffer.html).  
  
To use this method, the following must be true:

  * The [ComputeBuffer](ComputeBuffer.html) or [GraphicsBuffer](GraphicsBuffer.html) must have been created with a corresponding [ComputeBufferType.Constant](ComputeBufferType.Constant.html) or [GraphicsBuffer.Target.Constant](GraphicsBuffer.Target.Constant.html) flag.
  * All the shader variants for this Material must use the same constant buffer layout for the given constant buffer.
  * The data layout of the constant buffer must match exactly the data provided in the buffer.

The data layout of the constant buffer may be different depending on the
graphics API. This means `SetConstantBuffer` might overwrite data or set
variables to the wrong values. See [Writing shaders for different graphics
APIs](../Manual/SL-PlatformDifferences.html) for more information.  
  
After this function has been called with a non-null ComputeBuffer or
GraphicsBuffer, you can no longer manually set the value of a variable inside
the overridden constant buffer. Calls to
[Material.SetFloat](Material.SetFloat.html) and similar where the given
property name ID points to a variable inside the overridden constant buffer
will have no effect.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
**Known Issue**. Please check with the Issue Tracker at
