### Description

Flags used by
[ScriptableCullingParameters.cullingOptions](Rendering.ScriptableCullingParameters-
cullingOptions.html) to configure a culling operation.

Unity sets some of the [CullingOptions](Rendering.CullingOptions.html) flags
with default values, and others depending on the properties of the
[Camera](Camera.html) from which you obtained the
[ScriptableCullingParameters](Rendering.ScriptableCullingParameters.html)
struct. You can override these values before performing the culling operation.  
  
Additional resources:
[ScriptableCullingParameters.cullingOptions](Rendering.ScriptableCullingParameters-
cullingOptions.html),
[ScriptableRenderContext.Cull](Rendering.ScriptableRenderContext.Cull.html),
[Camera](Camera.html).
