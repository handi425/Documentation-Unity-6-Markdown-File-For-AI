## Declaration

public static void ShowObjectPicker([Object](Object.html) obj, bool
allowSceneObjects, string searchFilter, int controlID);

### Parameters

obj | The object to be selected by default.  
---|---  
allowSceneObjects | Is selection of Scene objects allowed, or should it only show assets.  
searchFilter | Default search filter to apply.  
controlID | The id of the control to set. This is useful if you are showing more than one of these. You can get the value at a later time.  
  
### Description

Show the object picker from code.

Once the user interacts with the Object Picker, it will respond by sending
ExecuteCommand events back to the calling OnGUI that called this function. The
messages are:  
  
ObjectSelectorUpdated - The selected object was changed. The selected object
can be read by calling
[GetObjectPickerObject](EditorGUIUtility.GetObjectPickerObject.html)
ObjectSelectorClosed - The user closed the object picker.
