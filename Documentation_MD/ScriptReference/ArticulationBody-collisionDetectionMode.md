public [CollisionDetectionMode](CollisionDetectionMode.html)
collisionDetectionMode;

### Description

The ArticulationBody's collision detection mode.

Use this property to set up an ArticulationBody for continuous collision
detection, in order to prevent fast moving objects from passing through other
objects without detecting collisions. For best results, set this property to
[CollisionDetectionMode.ContinuousDynamic](CollisionDetectionMode.ContinuousDynamic.html)
for fast moving objects, and set it to
[CollisionDetectionMode.Continuous](CollisionDetectionMode.Continuous.html)
for other objects these fast moving objects need to collide with.  
  
Note: These two options have a big impact on the physics engine processing
resources. To consume fewer processing resources, you can alternatively use
[CollisionDetectionMode.ContinuousSpeculative](CollisionDetectionMode.ContinuousSpeculative.html)
(which you can also use on kinematic objects). However, if you don't have
issues with collisions of fast objects, you should leave this property set to
the default value
[CollisionDetectionMode.Discrete](CollisionDetectionMode.Discrete.html).  
  
Restriction: You can use Continuous Collision Detection only for
ArticulationBodies with Sphere-, Capsule- or BoxColliders.  
  
Additional resources: [CollisionDetectionMode](CollisionDetectionMode.html).
