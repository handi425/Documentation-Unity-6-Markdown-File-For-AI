## Declaration

public void GetItemMergedSamplesColumnData(int id, int column, List<string>
outStrings);

### Parameters

id | Hierarchy item identifier.  
---|---  
column | Column identifier.  
outStrings | List filled with values of merged samples as a result of a method call.  
  
### Description

Use to retrieve a values of merged samples of a hierarchy item.

When HierarchyFrameDataView.ViewMode.MergeSamplesWithTheSameName is active,
multiple samples with the same name at the same hierarchy level are merged
together and are represented by a single item. Respectively
[HierarchyFrameDataView.GetItemColumnData](Profiling.HierarchyFrameDataView.GetItemColumnData.html)
in this case represents an aggregated value.  
_GetItemMergedSamplesColumnData_ allows to obtain values of individual samples
in merged hierarchy.  
The result is written to _outStrings_ list which is resized if necessary.
