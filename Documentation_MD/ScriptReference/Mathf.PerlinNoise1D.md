## Declaration

public static float PerlinNoise1D(float x);

### Parameters

x | The X-coordinate of the given sample point.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**float** A value in the range of 0.0 and 1.0. The value might be slightly
higher or lower than this range.

### Description

Generates a 1D pseudo-random pattern of float values across a 2D plane.

Although the noise plane is two-dimensional, you can use a single one-
dimensional line through the pattern to good effect, for example for animation
effects. The result of PerlinNoise1D(x) is equivalent to PerlinNoise(x, 0),
but the former is faster.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        // "Bobbing" animation from 1D Perlin noise.  
      
        // Range over which height varies.
        float heightScale = 1.0f;  
      
        // Distance covered per second along X axis of Perlin plane.
        float xScale = 1.0f;  
      
    
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            float height = heightScale * [Mathf.PerlinNoise1D](Mathf.PerlinNoise1D.html)([Time.time](Time-time.html) * xScale);
            [Vector3](Vector3.html) pos = transform.position;
            pos.y = height;
            transform.position = pos;
        }
    }
    

**Note:** It is possible for the return value to be slightly less than 0.0f or
slightly exceed 1.0f. You may need to clamp the return value if the 0.0 to 1.0
range is important to you.
