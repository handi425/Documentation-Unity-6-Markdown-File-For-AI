public [Vector2](Vector2.html) totalForce;

### Description

The total amount of force that has been explicitly applied to this
[Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) since the last physics simulation step.

When adding force to the [Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) using
[Rigidbody2D.AddForce](Rigidbody2D.AddForce.html),
[Rigidbody2D.AddForceAtPosition](Rigidbody2D.AddForceAtPosition.html) or
[Rigidbody2D.AddRelativeForce](Rigidbody2D.AddRelativeForce.html) the force
total is summed. This only applies when using
[ForceMode2D.Force](ForceMode2D.Force.html) and not when using
[ForceMode2D.Impulse](ForceMode2D.Impulse.html).  
  
During the next simulation step, the total force will be time-integrated into
the [Rigidbody2D.linearVelocity](Rigidbody2D-linearVelocity.html) then
automatically reset to [zero](Vector2-zero.html).  
  
**NOTE** : Only a [Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) with a [Dynamic Body
Type](RigidbodyType2D.Dynamic.html) will respond to force or torque. Setting
this property on a [Kinematic Body Type](RigidbodyType2D.Kinematic.html) or
[Static Body Type](RigidbodyType2D.Static.html) will have no effect.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.Assertions;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            // Fetch the rigidbody.
            var body = GetComponent<[Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html)>();  
      
            // Make the assumption the body has no previous force applied.
            [Assert.AreEqual](Assertions.Assert.AreEqual.html)([Vector2.zero](Vector2-zero.html), body.totalForce);  
      
            // Initialize a force.
            var force = new [Vector2](Vector2.html)(3f, 2f);  
      
            // Add the force.
            body.AddForce(force);  
      
            // The total force should be what we just added.
            [Assert.AreEqual](Assertions.Assert.AreEqual.html)(force, body.totalForce);  
      
            // Add the same force again.
            body.AddForce(force);  
      
            // The total force should still be what we've added.
            [Assert.AreEqual](Assertions.Assert.AreEqual.html)(force * 2f, body.totalForce);  
      
            // We can reset any force that has been applied since the last simulation step.
            body.totalForce = [Vector2.zero](Vector2-zero.html);
        }
    }
