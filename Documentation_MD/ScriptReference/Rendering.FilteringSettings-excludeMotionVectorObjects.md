public bool excludeMotionVectorObjects;

### Description

Determines if Unity excludes GameObjects that are in motion from rendering.
This refers to GameObjects that have an active Motion Vector pass assigned to
their Material or have set the Motion Vector mode to **per object motion**
(Menu: **Mesh Renderer > Additional Settings > Motion Vectors > Per Object
Motion**). For Unity to exclude a GameObject from rendering, the GameObject
must have moved since the last frame. To exclude a GameObject manually, enable
a [Motion Vector](../Manual/class-MeshRenderer.html) pass.

simple render loop in a custom render pipeline](../Manual/srp-creating-simple-
render-loop.html).
