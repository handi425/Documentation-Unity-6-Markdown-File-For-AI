public bool hasFixedDuration;

### Description

Determines whether the duration of the transition is reported in a fixed
duration in seconds or as a normalized time.

If `hasFixedDuration` is true, the transition duration is in seconds.  
  
If `hasFixedDuration` is false, the transition duration is in normalized time.  
  
**Note:** In normalized time, a duration of 1 makes the transition the same
length as the state that triggered it. A value of 2, for instance, would make
the transition twice as long as the state that triggered it.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
