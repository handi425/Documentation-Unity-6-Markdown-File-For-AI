## Declaration

public static void PickAllObjects([Vector2](Vector2.html) position,
List<Object> results);

### Parameters

position | The position in screen coordinates. The top-left of the window is (0,0), and the bottom-right is (Screen.width, Screen.height).  
---|---  
results | The output list to populate with all GameObjects at the specified position.  
  
### Description

Creates a list of all GameObjects under the specified position in screen
coordinates.

`HandleUtility.PickAllObjects` must not be called during a repaint. In most
cases, it is appropriate to call during
[EventType.MouseDown](EventType.MouseDown.html) or
[EventType.MouseUp](EventType.MouseUp.html). A common use would be to pick all
GameObjects at the current cursor position.
