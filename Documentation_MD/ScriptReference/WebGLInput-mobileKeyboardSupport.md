public static bool mobileKeyboardSupport;

### Description

Enable mobile keyboard support for UI input fields.

This property determines whether to enable mobile keyboard support for UI
input fields. If this is enabled (default), the browser's soft keyboard will
be requested when selecting an input field, and may impose some overhead to
touch down and up events.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
    #if !UNITY_EDITOR && UNITY_WEBGL
            // disable [WebGLInput.mobileKeyboardSupport](WebGLInput-mobileKeyboardSupport.html) so the built-in mobile keyboard support is disabled.
            [WebGLInput.mobileKeyboardSupport](WebGLInput-mobileKeyboardSupport.html) = false;
    #endif
        }
    }
