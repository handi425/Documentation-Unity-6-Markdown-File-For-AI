### Parameters

s | A string containing escaped characters.

e | The text encoding to use.  
  
### Description

Converts URL-friendly escape sequences back to normal text.

Certain text characters have special meanings when present in URLs. If you
need to include those characters in URL parameters then you must represent
them with escape sequences. This function takes a string containing these
escape sequences and converts them back to normal text. See Also:
[UnityWebRequest.EscapeURL](Networking.UnityWebRequest.EscapeURL.html).

            string plainName = [UnityWebRequest.UnEscapeURL](Networking.UnityWebRequest.UnEscapeURL.html)("Fish+%26+Chips");
