## Declaration

public static long GetMonoHeapSizeLong();

### Returns

**long** The size of the managed heap.

### Description

Returns the size of the reserved space for managed-memory.

This will grow when the total allocated managed-memory exceeds the currently
reserved amount. The size of the reserved space for managed allocations, will
also have an effect on how frequent the garbage collector will run, and how
long it takes to make a garbage collection. The larger the heap, the longer it
takes, but the less often it will run.  
  
**Note** : This API is available even when the rest of Profiler class is not
available (ie, in release builds).

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.Profiling;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("Allocated Mono heap size" + [Profiler.GetMonoHeapSizeLong](Profiling.Profiler.GetMonoHeapSizeLong.html)() + "Bytes");
        }
    }
