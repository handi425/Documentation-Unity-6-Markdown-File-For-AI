### Description

A variant of Debug.Log that logs a warning message to the console.

When you select the message in the console a connection to the context object
will be drawn. This is very useful if you want know on which object a warning
occurs.  
  
When the message is a string, rich text markup can be used to add emphasis.
See the manual page about [rich text](../Manual/StyledText.html) for details
of the different markup tags available.
