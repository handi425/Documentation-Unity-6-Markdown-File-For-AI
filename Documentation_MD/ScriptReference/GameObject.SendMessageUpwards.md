in the Manual")

## Declaration

public void SendMessageUpwards(string methodName, object value = null,
[SendMessageOptions](SendMessageOptions.html) options =
SendMessageOptions.RequireReceiver);

### Parameters

methodName | The name of the MonoBehaviour method to call.  
---|---  
value | An optional parameter value to pass to the called method.  
options | Whether an error should be raised if the method doesn't exist on the target object.  
  
### Description

Calls the specified method on every MonoBehaviour attached to the GameObject
and on every ancestor of the behaviour.

A `value` parameter specified for a method that doesn't accept parameters is
ignored. If `options` is set to
[SendMessageOptions.RequireReceiver](SendMessageOptions.RequireReceiver.html)
an error is printed when the message is not picked up by any component.  
  
**Note** : Messages are not sent to MonoBehaviours attached to objects for
which [GameObject.activeSelf](GameObject-activeSelf.html) or
[GameObject.activeInHierarchy](GameObject-activeInHierarchy.html) are `false`.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            // Calls the function ApplyDamage with a value of 5
            gameObject.SendMessageUpwards("ApplyDamage", 5.0);
        }
    }  
      
    public class Example2 : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public void ApplyDamage(float damage)
        {
            print(damage);
        }
    }
