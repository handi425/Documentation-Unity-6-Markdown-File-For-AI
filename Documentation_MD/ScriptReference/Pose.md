position, and an identity rotation.

[forward](Pose-forward.html)| Returns the forward vector of the pose.  
---|---  
[position](Pose-position.html)| The position component of the pose.  
[right](Pose-right.html)| Returns the right vector of the pose.  
[rotation](Pose-rotation.html)| The rotation component of the pose.  
[up](Pose-up.html)| Returns the up vector of the pose.  
  
### Constructors

[Pose](Pose-ctor.html)| Creates a new pose with the given vector, and
