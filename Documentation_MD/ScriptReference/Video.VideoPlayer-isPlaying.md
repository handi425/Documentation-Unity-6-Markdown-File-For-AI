public bool isPlaying;

### Description

Returns whether the VideoPlayer is currently playing the content.

This variable returns `false` if the video is paused. If you call
[VideoPlayer.Play](Video.VideoPlayer.Play.html), it might not always set
`isPlaying` to `true`. The [VideoPlayer](Video.VideoPlayer.html) must
successfully prepare the content before it starts to play. To prepare the
content before you use [VideoPlayer.Play](Video.VideoPlayer.Play.html), use
[VideoPlayer.Prepare](Video.VideoPlayer.Prepare.html).  
  
Additional resources: [VideoPlayer.Play](Video.VideoPlayer.Play.html),
[VideoPlayer.isPaused](Video.VideoPlayer-isPaused.html),
[VideoPlayer.Pause](Video.VideoPlayer.Pause.html).

    
    
    // In the Inspector of a [GameObject](GameObject.html), attach this script and a [VideoPlayer](Video.VideoPlayer.html) component.   
      
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.Video;  
      
    public class IsPlayingExample: [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        [VideoPlayer](Video.VideoPlayer.html) videoPlayer;   
      
        void Start()
        {
            // Get the [VideoPlayer](Video.VideoPlayer.html) component from the [GameObject](GameObject.html) with this script attached. 
            videoPlayer = GetComponent<[VideoPlayer](Video.VideoPlayer.html)>();
        }  
      
        private void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            // Press the Spacebar to pause the video if it's playing. 
            if ([Input.GetKeyDown](Input.GetKeyDown.html)("space"))
            {
                // If the [VideoPlayer](Video.VideoPlayer.html) is currently playing a video, pause the video. 
                if(videoPlayer.isPlaying)
                {
                    videoPlayer.Pause(); 
                }
