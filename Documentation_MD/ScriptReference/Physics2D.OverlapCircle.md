## Declaration

public static [Collider2D](Collider2D.html)
OverlapCircle([Vector2](Vector2.html) point, float radius, int layerMask =
DefaultRaycastLayers, float minDepth = -Mathf.Infinity, float maxDepth =
Mathf.Infinity);

### Parameters

point | Centre of the circle.  
---|---  
radius | The radius of the circle.  
layerMask | Filter to check objects only on specific layers.  
minDepth | Only include objects with a Z coordinate (depth) greater than or equal to this value.  
maxDepth | Only include objects with a Z coordinate (depth) less than or equal to this value.  
  
### Returns

**Collider2D** The Collider overlapping the circle.

### Description

Checks if a Collider falls within a circular area.

The circle is defined by its centre coordinate in world space and by its
radius. The optional _layerMask_ allows the test to check only for objects on
specific layers.  
  
Although the Z axis is not relevant for rendering or collisions in 2D, you can
use the _minDepth_ and _maxDepth_ parameters to filter objects based on their
Z coordinate. If more than one Collider falls within the circle then the one
returned will be the one with the lowest Z coordinate value. Null is returned
if there are no Colliders in the circle. Additional resources:
[OverlapCircleAll](Physics2D.OverlapCircleAll.html),

## Declaration

public static int OverlapCircle([Vector2](Vector2.html) point, float radius,
[ContactFilter2D](ContactFilter2D.html) contactFilter, Collider2D[] results);

### Parameters

point | Centre of the circle.  
---|---  
radius | The radius of the circle.  
contactFilter | The contact filter used to filter the results differently, such as by layer mask, Z depth. Note that normal angle is not used for overlap testing.  
results | The array to receive results. The size of the array determines the maximum number of results that can be returned.  
  
### Returns

**int** Returns the number of results placed in the `results` array.

### Description

Checks if a Collider is within a circular area.

This function returns the number of Colliders found and places those Colliders
in the `results` array. The results can also be filtered by the
`contactFilter`. Note that filtering by normal angle is not available for
overlap functions.

## Declaration

public static int OverlapCircle([Vector2](Vector2.html) point, float radius,
[ContactFilter2D](ContactFilter2D.html) contactFilter, List<Collider2D>
results);

### Parameters

point | Centre of the circle.  
---|---  
radius | The radius of the circle.  
contactFilter | The contact filter used to filter the results differently, such as by layer mask, Z depth. Note that normal angle is not used for overlap testing.  
results | The list to receive results.  
  
### Returns

**int** Returns the number of results placed in the `results` list.

### Description

Checks if a Collider is within a circular area.

The integer return value is the number of results written into the `results`
list. The results list will be resized if it doesn't contain enough elements
to report all the results. This prevents memory from being allocated for
results when the `results` list does not need to be resized, and improves
garbage collection performance when the query is performed frequently.
