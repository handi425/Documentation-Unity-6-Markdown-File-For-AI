## Declaration

public void SetKeepUnusedCameraRenderingResources(int cameraInstanceID, bool
keepUnused);

### Parameters

cameraInstanceID | The InstanceID of the camera for which freeUnusedRenderingResources is being set. See [Object.GetInstanceID](Object.GetInstanceID.html).  
---|---  
freeUnusedRenderingResources | The value to set to this camera's freeUnusedRenderingResources flag.  
  
### Description

Defines whether Unity cleans up rendering resources for a given Camera during
garbage collection.

Each Camera has its own `KeepUnusedRenderingResources` setting, which is
`false` by default. Unity uses this per-Camera setting in combination with the
Terrain's overall `KeepUnusedRenderingResources` setting. If either setting is
`true`, Unity preserves all rendering resources regardless of how long they've
remained unused.

keepUnusedRenderingResources.html).
