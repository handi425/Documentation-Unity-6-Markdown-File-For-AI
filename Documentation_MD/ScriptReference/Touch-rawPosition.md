public [Vector2](Vector2.html) rawPosition;

### Description

The first position of the touch contact in screen space pixel coordinates.

Raw position returns the original position of a touch contact and doesn't
change as the touch is dragged. If you need the current position of the touch
see [Touch.position](Touch-position.html).  
  
The bottom-left of the screen or window is at (0, 0). The top-right of the
screen or window is at (Screen.width, Screen.height).

    
    
    // This script outputs the raw position of an active touch contact  
      
    // Attach this script to a [GameObject](GameObject.html)
    // Create a Text [GameObject](GameObject.html) ([GameObject](GameObject.html)>UI>Text)
    // Attach the Text to the Text field in the Inspector window of your [GameObject](GameObject.html)  
      
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.UI;  
      
    public class TouchRawPositionExample : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public Text m_Text;  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            if ([Input.touchCount](Input-touchCount.html) > 0)
            {
                [Touch](Touch.html) touch = [Input.GetTouch](Input.GetTouch.html)(0);  
      
                // [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html) the Text on the screen depending on the raw position of the touch
                // NOTE: rawPosition doesn't change when the touch contact is dragged
                m_Text.text = "Raw [Position](UIElements.Position.html) : " + touch.rawPosition;
            }
            else
            {
                m_Text.text = "No touch contacts";
            }
        }
    }
