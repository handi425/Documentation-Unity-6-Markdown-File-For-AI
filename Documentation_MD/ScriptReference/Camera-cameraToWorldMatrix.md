[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-Camera.html "Go to Camera Component in the
Manual")

public [Matrix4x4](Matrix4x4.html) cameraToWorldMatrix;

### Description

Matrix that transforms from camera space to world space (Read Only).

Use this to calculate where in the world a specific camera space point is.  
  
Note that camera space matches OpenGL convention: camera's forward is the
negative Z axis. This is different from Unity's convention, where forward is
the positive Z axis.

    
    
    // Draw a yellow sphere in [Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html) view at distance/
    // units along camera's viewing direction.  
      
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public float distance = -1.0F;
        void OnDrawGizmosSelected()
        {
            [Matrix4x4](Matrix4x4.html) m = Camera.main.cameraToWorldMatrix;
            [Vector3](Vector3.html) p = m.MultiplyPoint(new [Vector3](Vector3.html)(0, 0, distance));
            [Gizmos.color](Gizmos-color.html) = [Color.yellow](Color-yellow.html);
            [Gizmos.DrawSphere](Gizmos.DrawSphere.html)(p, 0.2F);
        }
