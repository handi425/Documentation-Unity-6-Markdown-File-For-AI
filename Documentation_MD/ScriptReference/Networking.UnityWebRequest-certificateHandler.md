public [Networking.CertificateHandler](Networking.CertificateHandler.html)
certificateHandler;

### Description

Holds a reference to a
[CertificateHandler](Networking.CertificateHandler.html) object, which manages
certificate validation for this
[UnityWebRequest](Networking.UnityWebRequest.html).

Setting this property to `null` makes the platform use the default certificate
validation, which will validate certificates against a root certificate
authority store (most commonly Operating System store).  
  
Not all platforms support certificate validation callbacks. See
[CertificateHandler](Networking.CertificateHandler.html) for a list of
supported platforms.  
  
This property cannot be changed after calling
[SendWebRequest](Networking.UnityWebRequest.SendWebRequest.html).  
  
_Default value:_ `null`.
