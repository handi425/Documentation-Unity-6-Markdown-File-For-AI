the Manual")

## Declaration

public void MatchTarget([Vector3](Vector3.html) matchPosition,
[Quaternion](Quaternion.html) matchRotation, [AvatarTarget](AvatarTarget.html)
targetBodyPart, [MatchTargetWeightMask](MatchTargetWeightMask.html)
weightMask, float startNormalizedTime, float targetNormalizedTime = 1);

### Parameters

matchPosition | The position we want the body part to reach.  
---|---  
matchRotation | The rotation in which we want the body part to be.  
targetBodyPart | The body part that is involved in the match.  
weightMask | Structure that contains weights for matching position and rotation.  
startNormalizedTime | Start time within the animation clip (0 - beginning of clip, 1 - end of clip).  
targetNormalizedTime | End time within the animation clip (0 - beginning of clip, 1 - end of clip), values greater than 1 can be set to trigger a match after a certain number of loops. Ex: 2.3 means at 30% of 2nd loop.  
completeMatch | Allows you to specify what should happen if the MatchTarget function is interrupted. A value of true causes the GameObject to immediately move to the matchPosition if interrupted. A value of false causes the GameObject to stay at its current position if interrupted.  
  
### Description

Automatically adjust the `GameObject` position and rotation.

Adjust the `GameObject` position and rotation so that the AvatarTarget reaches
the matchPosition when the current state is at the specified progress. Target
matching only works on the base layer (index 0). You can only queue one match
target at a time and you must wait for the first one to finish, otherwise your
target matching will be discarded. If you call a
[MatchTarget](Animator.MatchTarget.html) with a start time lower than the
clip's normalized time and the clip can loop,
[MatchTarget](Animator.MatchTarget.html) will adjust the time to match the
next clip loop. For example, start time= 0.2 normalized time = 0.3, start time
will be 1.2. [Animator.applyRootMotion](Animator-applyRootMotion.html) must be
enabled for MatchTarget to take effect.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class TargetMatchingManager : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public void MatchTarget([Vector3](Vector3.html) matchPosition, [Quaternion](Quaternion.html) matchRotation, [AvatarTarget](AvatarTarget.html) target, [MatchTargetWeightMask](MatchTargetWeightMask.html) weightMask, float normalisedStartTime, float normalisedEndTime)
        {
            var animator = GetComponent<[Animator](Animator.html)>();  
      
            if (animator.isMatchingTarget)
                return;  
      
            float normalizeTime = [Mathf.Repeat](Mathf.Repeat.html)(animator.GetCurrentAnimatorStateInfo(0).normalizedTime, 1f);  
      
            if (normalizeTime > normalisedEndTime)
                return;  
      
            animator.MatchTarget(matchPosition, matchRotation, target, weightMask, normalisedStartTime, normalisedEndTime);
        }
    }
