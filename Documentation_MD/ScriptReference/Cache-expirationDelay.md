public int expirationDelay;

### Description

The number of seconds that an AssetBundle may remain unused in the cache
before it is automatically deleted.

This value defaults to 150 days (12,960,000 seconds). Lower values will cause
the cache to be cleaned more aggressively in order to minimize disk storage
usage. The delay cannot be set greater than 12,960,000 seconds.
