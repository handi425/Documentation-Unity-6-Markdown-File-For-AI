public int sortingOrder;

### Description

Canvas' order within a sorting layer.

When comparing canvases in the same sorting layer, the one with a higher
sorting order is displayed above the one with a lower sorting order. **Note**
: Internally the value is stored as a signed 16-bit integer (short) and is
constrained within the range of `-32,768` to `32,767`. See
[Renderer](Renderer.html).
