### Description

Disposable helper class for managing
[BeginScrollView](GUILayout.BeginScrollView.html) /
[EndScrollView](GUILayout.EndScrollView.html).

Automatically laid out scrollviews will take whatever content you have inside
them and display normally. If it doesn't fit, scrollbars will appear. A call
to BeginScrollView must always be matched with a call to EndScrollView.

_Scroll View in the Game View.._

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        // The variable to control where the scrollview 'looks' into its child elements.
        public [Vector2](Vector2.html) scrollPosition;  
      
        // The string to display inside the scrollview. 2 buttons below add & clear this string.
        public string longString = "This is a long-ish string";  
      
        void OnGUI()
        {
            // Begin a scroll view. All rects are calculated automatically -
            // it will use up any available screen space and make sure contents flow correctly.
            // This is kept small with the last two parameters to force scrollbars to appear.
            using (var scrollViewScope = new [ScrollViewScope](GUILayout.ScrollViewScope.html)(scrollPosition, [GUILayout.Width](GUILayout.Width.html)(100), [GUILayout.Height](GUILayout.Height.html)(100)))

                scrollPosition = scrollViewScope.scrollPosition;  
      
                // We just add a single label to go inside the scroll view. Note how the
                // scrollbars will work correctly with wordwrap.
                [GUILayout.Label](GUILayout.Label.html)(longString);  
      
                // Add a button to clear the string. This is inside the scroll area, so it
                // will be scrolled as well. Note how the button becomes narrower to make room
                // for the vertical scrollbar
                if ([GUILayout.Button](GUILayout.Button.html)("Clear"))
                    longString = "";
            }  
      
            // Now we add a button outside the scrollview - this will be shown below
            // the scrolling area.

                longString += "\nHere is another line";
