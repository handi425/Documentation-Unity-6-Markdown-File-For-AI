## Declaration

public void GetIndices(NativeArray<int> outIndices, int submesh, bool
applyBaseVertex = true);

### Parameters

outIndices | The destination indices array.  
---|---  
submesh | The index of the sub-mesh to get the indices for. See [subMeshCount](Mesh.MeshData-subMeshCount.html).  
applyBaseVertex | If true, Unity will apply base vertex offset to the returned indices. The default value is true.  
  
### Description

Populates an array with the indices for a given sub-mesh from the `MeshData`.

The destination array must have enough elements to hold the index buffer of
the given sub-mesh. See [GetSubMesh](Mesh.MeshData.GetSubMesh.html) and
[SubMeshDescriptor.indexCount](Rendering.SubMeshDescriptor-indexCount.html).
