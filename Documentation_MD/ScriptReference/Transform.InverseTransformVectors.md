in the Manual")

### Parameters

vectors | The vectors to be transformed, each is replaced by the transformed version.  
---|---  
  
### Description

Transforms multiple vectors from world space to local space overwriting each
original position with the transformed version. The opposite of
[Transform.TransformVectors](Transform.TransformVectors.html).

This operation is not affected by position of the transform but it is affected
by scale. The transformed vectors may have different lengths than the
originals.

## Declaration

public void InverseTransformVectors(ReadOnlySpan<Vector3> vectors,
Span<Vector3> transformedVectors);

### Parameters

vectors | The vectors to be transformed, these vectors are not modified by the function unless the `transformedVectors` span overlaps.  
---|---  
transformedVectors | Receives the transformed vectors, must be the same length as `vectors` otherwise an exception will be thrown. If this span overlaps `vectors` other than representing the exact same elements the behaviour is undefined.  
  
### Description

Transforms the vector `x`, `y`, `z` from world space to local space writing
the transformed positions to a possibly different location. The opposite of
[Transform.TransformVector](Transform.TransformVector.html).

This operation is not affected by position of the transform but it is affected
by scale.The transformed vectors may have different lengths than the
originals.
