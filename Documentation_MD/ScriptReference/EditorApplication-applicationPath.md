public static string applicationPath;

### Description

Gets the path to the Unity Editor application. (Read Only)

The path to the Unity Editor can vary depending on your configuration. If you
installed the 2021.3 Editor from the Hub on Windows, you might have a path
like this: `C:/Program Files/Unity/Hub/Editor/2021.3.10f1/Editor/Unity.exe`.
Additional resources: [applicationContentsPath](EditorApplication-
applicationContentsPath.html).

    
    
    // [Display](Display.html) file system location where the Unity
    // executable is stored.  
      
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class ApplicationPathExample
    {
        // Create a menu item called "[Location](FilePathAttribute.Location.html) of Unity application" in the "Examples" [Menu](Menu.html). 
        // In the [Editor](Editor.html), click on "[Location](FilePathAttribute.Location.html) of Unity [Application](Application.html)" in the menu to display the path to the Unity executable in the Console.
        [[MenuItem](MenuItem.html)("Examples/[Location](FilePathAttribute.Location.html) of Unity application")]
        static void AppPath()
        {
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)([EditorApplication.applicationPath](EditorApplication-applicationPath.html));
        }
    }
