public [AdditionalCanvasShaderChannels](AdditionalCanvasShaderChannels.html)
additionalShaderChannels;

### Description

Get or set the mask of additional shader channels to be used when creating the
[Canvas](Canvas.html) mesh.

The [Canvas](Canvas.html) will always include Position, Color, and Uv0 shader
channels when generating the mesh for a overlay [Canvas](Canvas.html) and will
also include Normal and Tangent for ScreenSpace.Camera and World space
[Canvas](Canvas.html). These are the optional additional parameters to be
copied.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class SetCanvasShaderChannels : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public [Canvas](Canvas.html) canvas;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            canvas.additionalShaderChannels |= [AdditionalCanvasShaderChannels.Normal](AdditionalCanvasShaderChannels.Normal.html);
            canvas.additionalShaderChannels |= [AdditionalCanvasShaderChannels.TexCoord1](AdditionalCanvasShaderChannels.TexCoord1.html);
            canvas.additionalShaderChannels |= [AdditionalCanvasShaderChannels.Tangent](AdditionalCanvasShaderChannels.Tangent.html);
        }
    }
