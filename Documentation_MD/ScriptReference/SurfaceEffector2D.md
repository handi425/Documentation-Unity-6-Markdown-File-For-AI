### Description

Applies tangent forces along the surfaces of colliders.

When the source [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) is a trigger, the effector will
apply forces whenever the target [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) overlaps the
source. When the source [Collider](Collider.html) isn't a trigger, the
effector will apply forces whenever the target [Collider2D](Collider2D.html)
is in contact with the source only.  
  
This effector can be used to create constant speed elevators and moving
surfaces.

### Properties

[forceScale](SurfaceEffector2D-forceScale.html)| The scale of the impulse
force applied while attempting to reach the surface speed.  
---|---  
[speed](SurfaceEffector2D-speed.html)| The speed to be maintained along the
surface.  
[speedVariation](SurfaceEffector2D-speedVariation.html)| The speed variation
(from zero to the variation) added to base speed to be applied.  
[useBounce](SurfaceEffector2D-useBounce.html)| Should bounce be used for any
contact with the surface?  
[useContactForce](SurfaceEffector2D-useContactForce.html)| Should the impulse
force but applied to the contact point?  
[useFriction](SurfaceEffector2D-useFriction.html)| Should friction be used for
any contact with the surface?

[colliderMask](Effector2D-colliderMask.html)| The mask used to select specific
layers allowed to interact with the effector.  
[useColliderMask](Effector2D-useColliderMask.html)| Should the collider-mask
be used or the global collision matrix?  
[hideFlags](Object-hideFlags.html)| Should the object be hidden, saved with
the Scene or modifiable by the user?  
[name](Object-name.html)| The name of the object.
