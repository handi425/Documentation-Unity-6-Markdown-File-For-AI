## Declaration

public float GetBlendShapeWeight(int index);

### Parameters

index | The index of the BlendShape whose weight you want to retrieve. Index must be smaller than the [Mesh.blendShapeCount](Mesh-blendShapeCount.html) of the Mesh attached to this Renderer.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**float** The weight of the BlendShape.

### Description

Returns the weight of a BlendShape for this Renderer.

The weight of a BlendShape represents how much the Mesh has been blended (or
morphed) from its original shape to a target BlendShape (another Mesh
containing the same topology, but with different vertex positions than the
original). The BlendShape weight range includes values between the minimum and
the maximum weights defined in the model.
