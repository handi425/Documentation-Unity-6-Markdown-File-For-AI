## Declaration

public void DirtyHeightmapRegion([RectInt](RectInt.html) region,
[TerrainHeightmapSyncControl](TerrainHeightmapSyncControl.html) syncControl);

### Parameters

region | The rectangular region to mark as dirty.  
---|---  
syncControl | Controls how CPU synchronization is performed.  
  
### Description

Marks the specified part of the heightmap as dirty.

Use this function only after you manually change the GPU part of the heightmap
texture by rendering into it, or by using
[Graphics.CopyTexture](Graphics.CopyTexture.html). Use the `syncControl`
parameter to control how you want Unity to perform CPU synchronization. Unity
queues the reading back of unsynchronized data (height data, LOD data, or
both) until the next call to [SyncHeightmap](TerrainData.SyncHeightmap.html).  
  
If the current active [RenderTexture](RenderTexture.html) contains your
changes, and you want to copy a part of it into the heightmap texture, use
[CopyActiveRenderTextureToHeightmap](TerrainData.CopyActiveRenderTextureToHeightmap.html)
instead.  
  
This function sends out the OnTerrainChanged message with
[TerrainChangedFlags.Heightmap](TerrainChangedFlags.Heightmap.html) if you
pass
[TerrainHeightmapSyncControl.HeightAndLod](TerrainHeightmapSyncControl.HeightAndLod.html)
to the `syncControl` parameter. If you pass
[TerrainHeightmapSyncControl.Height](TerrainHeightmapSyncControl.Height.html)
to the `syncControl` parameter, it sends out the OnTerrainChanged message with
[TerrainChangedFlags.DelayedHeightmapUpdate](TerrainChangedFlags.DelayedHeightmapUpdate.html).
