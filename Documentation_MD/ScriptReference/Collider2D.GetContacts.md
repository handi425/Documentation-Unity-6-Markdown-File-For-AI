## Declaration

public int GetContacts(ContactPoint2D[] contacts);

### Parameters

contacts | An array of [ContactPoint2D](ContactPoint2D.html) used to receive the results.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**int** Returns the number of contacts placed in the `contacts` array.

### Description

Retrieves all contact points for this Collider.

Contacts involving a [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) set to be a trigger will
never be returned here because trigger Colliders do not have contact points.  
  
You should pass an array that is large enough to contain all the contacts you
want returned. This array would typically be reused so it should be of a size
that can return a reasonable quantity of contacts. No allocations occur in
this function which means no work is produced for the garbage collector.

## Declaration

public int GetContacts(Collider2D[] colliders);

### Parameters

colliders | An array of [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) used to receive the results.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**int** Returns the number of contacts placed in the `colliders` array.

### Description

Retrieves all colliders in contact with this Collider.

## Declaration

public int GetContacts([ContactFilter2D](ContactFilter2D.html) contactFilter,
ContactPoint2D[] contacts);

### Parameters

contactFilter | The contact filter used to filter the results differently, such as by layer mask, Z depth, or normal angle.  
---|---  
contacts | An array of [ContactPoint2D](ContactPoint2D.html) used to receive the results.  
  
### Returns

**int** Returns the number of contacts placed in the `contacts` array.

### Description

Retrieves all contact points for this Collider, with the results filtered by
the `contactFilter`.

Contacts involving a [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) set to be a trigger will
never be returned here because trigger Colliders do not have contact points.
This is true even if the `contactFilter` has its
[ContactFilter2D.useTriggers](ContactFilter2D-useTriggers.html) set to true.  
  
You should pass an array that is large enough to contain all the contacts you
want returned. This array would typically be reused so it should be of a size
that can return a reasonable quantity of contacts. No allocations occur in
this function which means no work is produced for the garbage collector.

## Declaration

public int GetContacts([ContactFilter2D](ContactFilter2D.html) contactFilter,
Collider2D[] colliders);

### Parameters

contactFilter | The contact filter used to filter the results differently, such as by layer mask, Z depth, or normal angle.  
---|---  
colliders | An array of [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) used to receive the results.  
  
### Returns

**int** Returns the number of colliders placed in the `colliders` array.

### Description

Retrieves all colliders in contact with this Collider, with the results
filtered by the `contactFilter`.

## Declaration

public int GetContacts(List<ContactPoint2D> contacts);

### Parameters

contacts | A list of [ContactPoint2D](ContactPoint2D.html) used to receive the results.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**int** Returns the number of contacts placed in the `contacts` list.

### Description

Retrieves all contact points for this Collider.

Contacts involving a [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) set to be a trigger will
never be returned here because trigger Colliders do not have contact points.  
  
The results list will be resized if it doesn't contain enough elements to
report all the results. This prevents memory from being allocated for results
when the `results` list does not need to be resized, and improves garbage
collection performance when the query is performed frequently.
