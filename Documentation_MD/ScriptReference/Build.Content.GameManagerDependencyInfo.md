### Description

Contains dependency information for internal Unity game manager classes. Call
[ContentBuildInterface.WriteGameManagersSerializedFile](Build.Content.ContentBuildInterface.WriteGameManagersSerializedFile.html)
or
[ContentBuildInterface.CalculatePlayerDependenciesForGameManagers](Build.Content.ContentBuildInterface.CalculatePlayerDependenciesForGameManagers.html)
to get an instance of this class.

Note: this class and its members exist to provide low-level support for the

manager-ui@latest/index.html).
