### Description

LZ4HC is a high compression variant of LZ4. LZ4HC compression results in
larger compressed files than LZMA, but does not require the entire bundle to
be decompressed before use.

LZ4HC compression makes it possible to load individual Assets from an Asset
Bundle quickly and using less memory than LZMA compressed Asset Bundles. This
compression method is not available for recompression at runtime, but LZ4 is.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
