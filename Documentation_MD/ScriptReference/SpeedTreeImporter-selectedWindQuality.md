[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-SpeedTreeImporter.html "Go to
SpeedTreeImporter Component in the Manual")

public int selectedWindQuality;

### Description

Gets and sets an integer corresponding to the SpeedTreeWind enum values. The
value is clamped by [SpeedTreeImporter.bestWindQuality](SpeedTreeImporter-
bestWindQuality.html) internally.

The possible wind quality values are as follows:  
  
`0` \- Off  
`1` \- Fastest  
`2` \- Fast  
`3` \- Better  
`4` \- Best  
`5` \- Palm (only available on palm-like trees)  
  
The SpeedTree Modeler determines the
[SpeedTreeImporter.bestWindQuality](SpeedTreeImporter-bestWindQuality.html)
value, which is then used to limit the available `selectedWindQuality` values.
You can lower the wind quality of a SpeedTree model in the Unity Editor based
on the application's needs, but you can't improve the wind quality without the
SpeedTree Modeler, which generates the necessary wind data in the SpeedTree
model file during the export process.  
  
To change this setting for a specific LOD, see
[SpeedTreeImporter.windQualities](SpeedTreeImporter-windQualities.html) and
[SpeedTreeImporter.enableSettingOverride](SpeedTreeImporter-
enableSettingOverride.html).
