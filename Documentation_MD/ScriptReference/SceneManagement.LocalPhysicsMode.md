### Description

Provides options for 2D and 3D local physics.

By default, when a [Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html) is created or loaded,
any 2D or 3D physics component added to a GameObject within the Scene is added
to the default physics Scene. Each [Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html) however
has the ability to create and own its own (local) 2D and/or 3D physics Scene.
This option can be used when creating or loading a Scene to specify whether a
2D and/or 3D physics Scene should be created.  
  
When a [Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html) creates its own 2D and/or 3D
physics Scene, the lifetime of the physics Scene(s) is the same as the
[Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html) i.e. if the
[Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html) is destroyed/unloaded then so are any
created physics Scenes.  
  
Additional resources:
[CreateSceneParameters](SceneManagement.CreateSceneParameters.html),
[LoadSceneParameters](SceneManagement.LoadSceneParameters.html),
[SceneManager.CreateScene](SceneManagement.SceneManager.CreateScene.html),
[SceneManager.LoadScene](SceneManagement.SceneManager.LoadScene.html) and
[SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync](SceneManagement.SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync.html).

### Properties

[None](SceneManagement.LocalPhysicsMode.None.html)| No local 2D or 3D physics
Scene will be created.  
---|---  
[Physics2D](SceneManagement.LocalPhysicsMode.Physics2D.html)| A local 2D
physics Scene will be created and owned by the Scene.  
[Physics3D](SceneManagement.LocalPhysicsMode.Physics3D.html)| A local 3D
physics Scene will be created and owned by the Scene.
