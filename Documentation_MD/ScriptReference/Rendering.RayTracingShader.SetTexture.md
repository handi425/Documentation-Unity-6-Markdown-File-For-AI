## Declaration

public void SetTexture(string name, [Texture](Texture.html) texture);

## Declaration

public void SetTexture(int nameID, [Texture](Texture.html) texture);

### Parameters

nameID | The ID of the resource as given by Shader.PropertyToID.  
---|---  
name | The name of the texture being set.  
texture | The texture to bind.  
  
### Description

Binds a texture resource. This can be a input or an output texture (UAV).

Only shaders defined in the .raytrace file can access the texture you
designate as the argument for this method. To make this texture accessible to
all ray tracing shader types (closest hit, any hit, miss, etc.), call the
[Shader.SetGlobalTexture](Shader.SetGlobalTexture.html) method instead.
