ArticulationBody Component in the Manual")

## Declaration

public [ArticulationReducedSpace](ArticulationReducedSpace.html)
GetJointForcesForAcceleration([ArticulationReducedSpace](ArticulationReducedSpace.html)
acceleration);

### Parameters

acceleration | The desired acceleration in reduced space.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**ArticulationReducedSpace** The forces needed for the body to reach the
desired acceleration in reduced space.

### Description

Returns the forces required for the body to reach the provided acceleration in
reduced space.

The number of DOF in the provided acceleration must match the DOF count of the
inbound joint. The calculation does **not** consider gravity and therefore
gravity must be counteracted with
[ArticulationBody.GetJointGravityForces](ArticulationBody.GetJointGravityForces.html).
ArticulationDrives and potential damping terms are not considered in the
computation (for example, linear/angular damping or joint friction).  
The returned forces can then be applied with
[ArticulationBody.jointForce](ArticulationBody-jointForce.html).  
  
Units of measurement - N (newtons) for linear and Nm (newton-meters) for
angular motion.
