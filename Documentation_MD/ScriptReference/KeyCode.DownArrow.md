### Description

Down arrow key.

Use this as a parameter to a function like [Input.GetKey](Input.GetKey.html)
to detect when the user presses the down arrow key.  
  
Additional resources: [Input.GetKey](Input.GetKey.html),
[Input.GetKeyDown](Input.GetKeyDown.html),
[Input.GetKeyUp](Input.GetKeyUp.html).

    
    
    //Attach this to a [GameObject](GameObject.html)
    //This script tells when the down arrow key is pressed and when it is released
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            //Detect when the down arrow key is pressed down
            if ([Input.GetKeyDown](Input.GetKeyDown.html)([KeyCode.DownArrow](KeyCode.DownArrow.html)))
                [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("Down Arrow key was pressed.");  
      
            //Detect when the down arrow key has been released
            if ([Input.GetKeyUp](Input.GetKeyUp.html)([KeyCode.DownArrow](KeyCode.DownArrow.html)))
                [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("Down Arrow key was released.");
        }
    }
