## Declaration

public static [GUIContent](GUIContent.html) IconContent(string name, string
text = null);

### Parameters

name | Name of the desired icon.  
---|---  
text | Tooltip for hovering over the icon.  
  
### Description

Fetch the [GUIContent](GUIContent.html) from the Unity builtin resources with
the given name.

[EditorGUIUtility.IconContent](EditorGUIUtility.IconContent.html) is used to
create a [GUIContent](GUIContent.html) for a GUI element. Only icons are
loaded. Typically the icon from `Assets/Editor Default Resources/Icons` is
fetched using the first argument. Only the name of the icon, without the png
extension is needed.  
  
The second argument provides the text for a hovering tooltip. This string
needs to start with a vertical bar "**|** " character to flag it as a tooltip.  
  
**Note:** The hovering over the tooltip cannot currently be positioned.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
