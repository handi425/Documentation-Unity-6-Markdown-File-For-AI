### Description

An interface that allows you to perform the same independent operation for
each position, rotation and scale of all the transforms passed into a job.

            // By declaring it as read only, multiple jobs are allowed to access the data in parallel
            [[ReadOnly](Unity.Collections.NativeArray_1.ReadOnly.html)]
            public NativeArray<[Vector3](Vector3.html)> velocity;  
      
            // Delta time must be copied to the job since jobs generally don't have a concept of a frame.
            // The main thread waits for the job same frame or next frame, but the job should do work deterministically
            // independent on when the job happens to run on the worker threads.
            public float deltaTime;  
      
            // The code actually running on the job
            public void Execute(int index, [TransformAccess](Jobs.TransformAccess.html) transform)

            // The method takes a [TransformAccessArray](Jobs.TransformAccessArray.html) which contains the Transforms that will be acted on in the job.
            [JobHandle](Unity.Jobs.JobHandle.html) jobHandle = job.Schedule(m_AccessArray);  
      
            // Ensure the job has completed.
            // It is not recommended to Complete a job immediately,
            // since that reduces the chance of having other jobs run in parallel with this one.
            // You optimally want to schedule a job early in a frame and then wait for it later in the frame.
            jobHandle.Complete();
