## Declaration

public void SetPixels32(Color32[] colors, int arrayElement, int miplevel);

## Declaration

public void SetPixels32(Color32[] colors, int arrayElement);

### Parameters

colors | The array of pixel colours to use. This is a 2D image flattened to a 1D array.  
---|---  
arrayElement | The array slice to write `colors` to.  
miplevel | The mipmap level to write `colors` to. The range is `0` through the texture's [Texture.mipmapCount](Texture-mipmapCount.html). The default value is `0`.  
  
### Description

Sets the pixel colors of an entire mipmap level of a slice.

This method sets pixel data for the texture in CPU memory.
[Texture.isReadable](Texture-isReadable.html) must be `true`, and you must
call [Apply](Texture2DArray.Apply.html) after `SetPixels32` to upload the
changed pixels to the GPU.  
  
`colors` must contain the pixels row by row, starting at the bottom left of
the texture. The size of the array must be the width x height of the mipmap
level.  
  
`SetPixels32` might be slower than some other texture methods because it
converts the [Color32](Color32.html) struct into the format the texture uses.
To set pixel data more quickly, use
[SetPixelData](Texture2DArray.SetPixelData.html) instead.  
  
You can use `SetPixels32` with the following [texture
formats](TextureFormat.html):

  * Alpha8
  * ARGB32
  * ARGB4444
  * BGRA32
  * R16
  * R16_SIGNED
  * R8
  * R8_SIGNED
  * RFloat
  * RG16
  * RG16_SIGNED
  * RG32
  * RG32_SIGNED
  * RGB24
  * RGB24_SIGNED
  * RGB48
  * RGB48_SIGNED
  * RGB565
  * RGB9e5Float
  * RGBA32
  * RGBA32_SIGNED
  * RGBA4444
  * RGBA64
  * RGBA64_SIGNED
  * RGBAFloat
  * RGBAHalf
  * RGFloat
  * RGHalf
  * RHalf

For all other formats, `SetPixels32` fails. Unity throws an exception when
`SetPixels32` fails.
