**Obsolete** FindValidUploadPrefabInstanceRoot is deprecated, please use
GetOutermostPrefabInstanceRoot instead.

## Declaration

public static [GameObject](GameObject.html)
FindValidUploadPrefabInstanceRoot([GameObject](GameObject.html) target);

### Parameters

target | GameObject to process.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**GameObject** Return the root game object of the Prefab Asset.

### Description

Returns the root GameObject of the Prefab instance if that root Prefab
instance is a parent of the Prefab.

A Prefab internally consists of a Prefab object and the list of objects used
for the Prefab. The Prefab object has a reference to the root GameObject.
Also, if the Prefab is an instance, it contains a reference to the Prefab
Asset it was created from and a list of the overrides (if any) on the
instance.  
  
This works in the same way as
PrefabUtility.FindRootGameObjectWithSameParentPrefab but it will return the
root GameObject of the Prefab Asset. This is useful if you have a disconnected
Prefab instance object and you want to know the root game object of the Prefab
Asset which it used to be connected to.
