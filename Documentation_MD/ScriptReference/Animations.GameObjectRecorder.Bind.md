    public class ExampleScript : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            var recorder = new [GameObjectRecorder](Animations.GameObjectRecorder.html)(gameObject);  
      
            // Add a binding on the position on X axis.
            [EditorCurveBinding](EditorCurveBinding.html) binding = [EditorCurveBinding.FloatCurve](EditorCurveBinding.FloatCurve.html)("", typeof([Transform](Transform.html)), "m_LocalPosition.x");
            recorder.Bind(binding);  
      
            // Add a binding on the activation of the [MeshRenderer](MeshRenderer.html) component.
            binding = [EditorCurveBinding.FloatCurve](EditorCurveBinding.FloatCurve.html)("", typeof([MeshRenderer](MeshRenderer.html)), "m_Enabled");
            recorder.Bind(binding);
        }
    }
