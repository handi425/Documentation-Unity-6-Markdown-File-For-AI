public Vector4[] tangents;

### Description

The tangents of the Mesh.

Tangents are mostly used in bump-mapped Shaders. A tangent is a unit-length
vector that follows Mesh surface along horizontal (U) texture direction.
Tangents in Unity are represented as [Vector4](Vector4.html), with _x,y,z_
components defining the vector, and `w` used to flip the binormal if needed.  
  
Unity calculates the other surface vector (binormal) by taking a cross product
between the normal and the tangent, and multiplying the result by tangent.w.
Therefore, `w` should always be 1 or -1.  
  
You should calculate tangents yourself if you plan to use bump-mapped shaders
on the Mesh. Assign tangents after assigning [normals](Mesh-normals.html) or
using [RecalculateNormals](Mesh.RecalculateNormals.html).  
  
**Note:** To make changes to the [tangents](Mesh-tangents.html), it is
important to copy the tangents from the [Mesh](Mesh.html). Once the
[tangents](Mesh-tangents.html) have been copied and changed, the
[tangents](Mesh-tangents.html) can be reassigned back to the
[Mesh](Mesh.html).
