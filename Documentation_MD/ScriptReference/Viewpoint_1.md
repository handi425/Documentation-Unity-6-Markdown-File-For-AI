### Description

Defines a Viewpoint that can be selected from the Cameras overlay.

Use this base class with [ICameraLensData](ICameraLensData.html) to define a
Viewpoint and expose a component in the Cameras overlay. If you expose a
component in the Cameras overlay, you can use the Cameras overlay to look
through that component in the Scene view.  
  
To use this class, you must have a custom representation of your camera lens
in a [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html).  
  
When detected, the Cameras overlay creates an instance of the Viewpoint class
for each component that is type T0 in the scene.  
  
The Cameras overlay uses the icon that is attached to the component in the UI.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class MyVirtualCamera : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public float fov;
        public float nearPlane;
        public float farPlane;  
      
        public bool physicalProps;
        public float focalLength;
        public [Vector2](Vector2.html) sensor;
        public [Vector2](Vector2.html) lensShift;
        public [Camera.GateFitMode](Camera.GateFitMode.html) gateFit;
    }
    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);  
      
    class VirtualCameraViewpoint : Viewpoint<MyVirtualCamera>, [ICameraLensData](ICameraLensData.html)
    {
        public VirtualCameraViewpoint(MyVirtualCamera target) : base(target) { }  
      
        public float NearClipPlane => Target.nearPlane;  
      
        public float FarClipPlane => Target.farPlane;  
      
        // If you are not using physical properties, FieldOfView can change from the [SceneView](SceneView.html) with the scrollwheel action while looking through a camera.
        public float FieldOfView { get => Target.fov; set => Target.fov = value; }  
      
        public bool UsePhysicalProperties => Target.physicalProps;  
      
        // If you are using physical properties, FocalLength can change from the [SceneView](SceneView.html) with the scrollwheel action while looking through a camera.
        public float FocalLength { get => Target.focalLength; set => Target.focalLength = value; }  
      
        public [Vector2](Vector2.html) SensorSize => Target.sensor;  
      
        public [Vector2](Vector2.html) LensShift => Target.lensShift;  
      
        public [Camera.GateFitMode](Camera.GateFitMode.html) GateFit => Target.gateFit;  
      
        // The [SceneView](SceneView.html) sets orthographic to true when: 
        // - the 2DMode button is toggled on.
        // - orthographic view is set from the [Orientation](Experimental.GraphView.Orientation.html) gizmo.
        //
        // In this example, our representation doesn't consider orthographic view.
        public bool Orthographic { get => false; set { } }
        public float OrthographicSize { get => 0; set { } }
    }
