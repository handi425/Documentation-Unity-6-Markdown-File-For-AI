### Description

Enumeration of XR nodes which can be updated by XR input or sent haptic data.

**Note:** The types GameController, TrackingReference, and HardwareTracker are
considered non-singleton nodes, as there can be many of each available. As a
result, InputTracking.GetLocalPosition, and InputTracking.GetLocalRotation
will not work with those values. Please use
[InputTracking.GetNodeStates](XR.InputTracking.GetNodeStates.html) instead.
**Note:** Only XR nodes with valid haptic devices as endpoints can be sent
haptic data.
