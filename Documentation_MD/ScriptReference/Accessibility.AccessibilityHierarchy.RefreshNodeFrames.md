## Declaration

public void RefreshNodeFrames();

### Description

Refreshes all the node frames (i.e. the screen elements' positions) for the
hierarchy.

Calling this method sends a notification to the operating system that the
layout has changed, by calling
[IAccessibilityNotificationDispatcher.SendLayoutChanged](Accessibility.IAccessibilityNotificationDispatcher.SendLayoutChanged.html)
(with a `null` parameter).

frameGetter.html)
