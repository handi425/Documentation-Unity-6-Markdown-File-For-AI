## Declaration

public static void
RegisterGetBuildPlayerOptionsHandler(Func<BuildPlayerOptions,BuildPlayerOptions>
func);

### Parameters

func | Delegate System.Func that takes a [BuildPlayerOptions](BuildPlayerOptions.html) parameter. The value passed into the delegate will represent default options. The return value will be passed to the default build player handler, or to a custom handler set with [BuildPlayerWindow.RegisterBuildPlayerHandler](BuildPlayerWindow.RegisterBuildPlayerHandler.html).  
---|---  
  
### Description

Register a delegate method to calculate
[BuildPlayerOptions](BuildPlayerOptions.html) that are passed to the build
player handler. Registering a null value will restore default behavior, which
is the equivalent of calling
[BuildPlayerWindow.DefaultBuildMethods.GetBuildPlayerOptions](BuildPlayerWindow.DefaultBuildMethods.GetBuildPlayerOptions.html).

If this delegate is registered and used in conjunction with the default build
player handler, be sure to set [BuildPlayerOptions.scenes](BuildPlayerOptions-
scenes.html), [BuildPlayerOptions.locationPathName](BuildPlayerOptions-
locationPathName.html), and [BuildPlayerOptions.target](BuildPlayerOptions-
target.html) before exiting for the build process to proceed correctly.
