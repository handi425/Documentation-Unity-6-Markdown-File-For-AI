### Description

A delegate called whenever the global audio settings are changed, either by
[AudioSettings.Reset](AudioSettings.Reset.html) or by an external factor such
as the OS control panel changing the sample rate or because the default output
device was changed, for example when plugging in an HDMI monitor or a USB
headset.

See [AudioSettings.Reset](AudioSettings.Reset.html) for an example.
