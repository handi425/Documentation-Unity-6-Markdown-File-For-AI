## Declaration

public static void ResizeBuffers(float widthScale, float heightScale);

### Parameters

widthScale | New scale factor for the width that the ScalableBufferManager uses to resize all render textures that are marked as `DynamicallyScalable`. The value should be greater than 0.0, and less than or equal to 1.0  
---|---  
heightScale | New scale factor for the height that the ScalableBufferManager uses to resize all render textures that are marked as `DynamicallyScalable`. The value should be greater than 0.0, and less than or equal to 1.0.  
  
### Description

Function to resize all buffers marked as DynamicallyScalable.

Takes in new width and height scale and stores and applies it to all render
textures marked as DynamicallyScalable. Note that the scale is applied to the
render textures original dimensions so a scale factor of 1.0 will always be
the full dimensions for the specified render target, etc.  
  
Vulkan and DirectX 12 only allow uniform scaling through the utilization of
widthScale.
