### Description

Represents an axis aligned bounding box.

An axis-aligned bounding box, or AABB for short, is a box aligned with
coordinate axes and fully enclosing some object. Because the box is never
rotated with respect to the axes, it can be defined by just its
[center](Bounds-center.html) and [extents](Bounds-extents.html), or
alternatively by [min](Bounds-min.html) and [max](Bounds-max.html) points.  
  
`Bounds` is used by [Collider.bounds](Collider-bounds.html),
[Mesh.bounds](Mesh-bounds.html) and [Renderer.bounds](Renderer-bounds.html).

### Properties

[center](Bounds-center.html)| The center of the bounding box.  
---|---  
[extents](Bounds-extents.html)| The extents of the Bounding Box. This is
always half of the size of the Bounds.  
[max](Bounds-max.html)| The maximal point of the box. This is always equal to
center+extents.  
[min](Bounds-min.html)| The minimal point of the box. This is always equal to
center-extents.  
[size](Bounds-size.html)| The total size of the box. This is always twice as
large as the extents.  
  
### Constructors

[Bounds](Bounds-ctor.html)| Creates a new Bounds.  
---|---  
  
### Public Methods

[ClosestPoint](Bounds.ClosestPoint.html)| The closest point on the bounding
box.  
---|---  
[Contains](Bounds.Contains.html)| Is point contained in the bounding box?  
[Encapsulate](Bounds.Encapsulate.html)| Grows the Bounds to include the point.  
[Expand](Bounds.Expand.html)| Expand the bounds by increasing its size by
amount along each side.  
[IntersectRay](Bounds.IntersectRay.html)| Does ray intersect this bounding
box?  
[Intersects](Bounds.Intersects.html)| Does another bounding box intersect with
this bounding box?  
[SetMinMax](Bounds.SetMinMax.html)| Sets the bounds to the min and max value
of the box.  
[SqrDistance](Bounds.SqrDistance.html)| The smallest squared distance between
the point and this bounding box.  
[ToString](Bounds.ToString.html)| Returns a formatted string for the bounds.
