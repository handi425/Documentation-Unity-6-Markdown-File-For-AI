## Declaration

public int GetJointCoriolisCentrifugalForces(List<float> forces);

### Parameters

forces | Supplied list of floats to store the counteracting Coriolis/centrifugal force data.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**int** Total degrees of freedom (DoF) for the entire hierarchy of
articulation bodies.

### Description

Fills the supplied list of floats with the forces required to counteract the
Coriolis and centrifugal forces for each Articulation Body in the
articulation.

This returns the forces required to counteract the Coriolis and centrifugal
forces in the reduced coordinate space for the entire articulation hierarchy
starting from root to the supplied list of floats. Every joint drive force DOF
is represented by one float value. Depending on the type of the articulation
joint there might be zero, one or three DOFs per joint. To find the exact
location of the data in the resulting list for the specific articulation body,
call
[ArticulationBody.GetDofStartIndices](ArticulationBody.GetDofStartIndices.html)
and index the returned dofStartIndices list by the particular body index via
[ArticulationBody.index](ArticulationBody-index.html). To find the number of
DOF for the articulation body, use
[ArticulationBody.dofCount](ArticulationBody-dofCount.html).  
ArticulationDrives and potential damping terms are not considered in the
computation (for example, linear/angular damping or joint friction).
