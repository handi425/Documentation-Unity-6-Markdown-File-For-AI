[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-Quaternion.html "Go to Quaternion Component
in the Manual")

## Declaration

public static float Angle([Quaternion](Quaternion.html) a,
[Quaternion](Quaternion.html) b);

### Description

Returns the angle in degrees between two rotations `a` and `b`. The resulting
angle ranges from 0 to 180.

Example: Think of two GameObjects (A and B) moving around a third GameObject
(C). Lines from C to A and C to B create a triangle which can change over
time. The angle between CA and CB is the value
[Quaternion.Angle](Quaternion.Angle.html) provides.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    // Calculates the angle (degrees) between
    // the rotation of this transform and target.  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public [Transform](Transform.html) target;  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            float angle = [Quaternion.Angle](Quaternion.Angle.html)(transform.rotation, target.rotation);
        }
    }
