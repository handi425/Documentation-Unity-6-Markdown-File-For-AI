public [Vector3](Vector3.html) normal;

### Description

Normal of the contact point.

The following example will draw a line to represent every normal from a
collision. Each line will be drawn in the Scene view.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void OnCollisionEnter([Collision](Collision.html) other)
        {
            // Print how many points are colliding with this transform
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("Points colliding: " + other.contacts.Length);  
      
            // Print the normal of the first point in the collision.
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("Normal of the first point: " + other.contacts[0].normal);  
      
            // Draw a different colored ray for every normal in the collision
            foreach (var item in other.contacts)
            {
                [Debug.DrawRay](Debug.DrawRay.html)(item.point, item.normal * 100, [Random.ColorHSV](Random.ColorHSV.html)(0f, 1f, 1f, 1f, 0.5f, 1f), 10f);
            }
        }
    }
