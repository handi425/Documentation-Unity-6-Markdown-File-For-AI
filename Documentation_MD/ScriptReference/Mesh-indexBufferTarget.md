public [GraphicsBuffer.Target](GraphicsBuffer.Target.html) indexBufferTarget;

### Description

The intended target usage of the Mesh GPU index buffer.

By default, Mesh index buffers have
[GraphicsBuffer.Target.Index](GraphicsBuffer.Target.Index.html) usage target.
If you want to access the mesh index buffer from a compute shader, additional
targets need to be requested, for example
[GraphicsBuffer.Target.Raw](GraphicsBuffer.Target.Raw.html).

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class ExampleScript : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public [Mesh](Mesh.html) mesh;
        public [ComputeShader](ComputeShader.html) computeShader;
        void Start()
        {
            // Mark the index buffer as needing "Raw"
            // (ByteAddressBuffer, RWByteAddressBuffer in HLSL shaders)
            // access.
            mesh.indexBufferTarget |= [GraphicsBuffer.Target.Raw](GraphicsBuffer.Target.Raw.html);
            // Get the index buffer of the [Mesh](Mesh.html), and set it up
            // as a buffer parameter to a compute shader.
            var indexBuffer = mesh.GetIndexBuffer();
            computeShader.SetBuffer(0, "MeshIndexBuffer", indexBuffer);
            indexBuffer.Dispose();
        }
    }
