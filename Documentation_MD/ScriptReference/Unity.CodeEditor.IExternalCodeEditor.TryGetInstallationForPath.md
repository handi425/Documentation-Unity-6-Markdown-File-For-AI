## Declaration

public bool TryGetInstallationForPath(string editorPath, out
[Unity.CodeEditor.CodeEditor.Installation](Unity.CodeEditor.CodeEditor.Installation.html)
installation);

### Parameters

editorPath | The absolute path of the chosen code editor.  
---|---  
installation | To store the resulting [Installation](Unity.CodeEditor.CodeEditor.Installation.html). If return value is false, this result is ignored.  
  
### Returns

**bool** Whether this
[IExternalCodeEditor](Unity.CodeEditor.IExternalCodeEditor.html) can support
the **editorPath** implementation.

### Description

Unity stores the path of the chosen editor. An instance of
[IExternalCodeEditor](Unity.CodeEditor.IExternalCodeEditor.html) can take
responsibility for this path, by returning true when this method is being
called. The `out` variable **installation** need to be constructed with the
path and the name that should be shown in the "External Tools" code editor
list.

For supported code editor paths, this function sets the output variable
**installation** to an instance of
[Installation](Unity.CodeEditor.CodeEditor.Installation.html) which describes
the name that appears in the Editor Preference > Editor Tool section.
