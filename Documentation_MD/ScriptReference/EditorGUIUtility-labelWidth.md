public static float labelWidth;

### Description

The width in pixels reserved for labels of Editor GUI controls.

Editor GUI controls have a certain width allocated for labels. This width can
be changed by setting labelWidth to a different value. Setting it to 0 will
reset the label width to the default value. The default value can vary, for
example depending on the width of the Inspector window.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
