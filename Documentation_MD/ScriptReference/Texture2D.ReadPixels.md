## Declaration

public void ReadPixels([Rect](Rect.html) source, int destX, int destY, bool
recalculateMipMaps = true);

### Parameters

source | The region of the render target to read from.  
---|---  
destX | The x position in the texture to write the pixels to.  
destY | The y position in the texture to write the pixels to.  
recalculateMipMaps | When the value is `true`, Unity automatically recalculates the mipmap for the texture after it writes the pixel data. Otherwise, Unity doesn't do this automatically.  
  
### Description

Reads pixels from the current render target and writes them to a texture.

This method copies a rectangular area of pixel colors from the currently
active render target on the GPU (for example the screen, a
[RenderTexture](RenderTexture.html), or a
[GraphicsTexture](Rendering.GraphicsTexture.html)) and writes them to a
texture on the CPU at position (`destX`, `destY`).
[Texture.isReadable](Texture-isReadable.html) must be `true`, and you must
call [Apply](Texture2D.Apply.html) after `ReadPixels` to upload the changed
pixels to the GPU.  
  
The lower left corner is (0, 0).  
  
`ReadPixels` is usually slow, because the method waits for the GPU to complete
all previous work first. To copy a texture more quickly, use one of the
following methods instead:

  * [AsyncGPUReadback.RequestIntoNativeArray](Rendering.AsyncGPUReadback.RequestIntoNativeArray.html) to copy a texture from the GPU to the CPU.
  * [Graphics.CopyTexture](Graphics.CopyTexture.html), [CommandBuffer.CopyTexture](Rendering.CommandBuffer.CopyTexture.html) or [Graphics.Blit](Graphics.Blit.html) to copy a texture on the GPU only.

The render target and the texture must use the same format, and the format
must be supported on the device for both rendering and sampling.  
  
You can automatically update the mipmap when you call
[Apply](Texture2D.Apply.html) instead of setting `recalculateMipMaps` to
`true`.  
  
The following code example demonstrates how to use `ReadPixels` in the Built-
in Render Pipeline. In Scriptable Render Pipelines such as the Universal
Render Pipeline (URP), [Camera.onPostRender](Camera-onPostRender.html) isn't
available, but you can use
[RenderPipelineManager.endCameraRendering](Rendering.RenderPipelineManager-
endCameraRendering.html) in a similar way.

    public class ReadPixelsExample : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)

        // Set [Renderer](Renderer.html) to a [GameObject](GameObject.html) that has a [Renderer](Renderer.html) component and a material that displays a texture
        public [Renderer](Renderer.html) screenGrabRenderer;  
      
        private [Texture2D](Texture2D.html) destinationTexture;

            destinationTexture = new [Texture2D](Texture2D.html)([Screen.width](Screen-width.html), [Screen.height](Screen-height.html), [TextureFormat.RGB24](TextureFormat.RGB24.html), false);

                    // Note: This method is costly, and you should call it only when you need to
                    // If you do not intend to render the updated texture, there is no need to call this method at this point
                    destinationTexture.Apply();  
      
                    // Reset the isPerformingScreenGrab state
                    isPerformingScreenGrab = false;
                }
            }
        }  
      
        // Remove the onPostRender callback
        void OnDestroy()
        {
            [Camera.onPostRender](Camera-onPostRender.html) -= OnPostRenderCallback;
        }
    }
