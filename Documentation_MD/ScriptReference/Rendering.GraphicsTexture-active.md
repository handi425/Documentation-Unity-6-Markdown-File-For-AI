public static [Rendering.GraphicsTexture](Rendering.GraphicsTexture.html)
active;

### Description

Currently active graphics texture.

All rendering goes into the active GraphicsTexture. If the active
GraphicsTexture is `null`, everything renders in the main window. If the
active render target is a [RenderTexture](RenderTexture.html),
`GraphicsTexture.active` returns the [graphicsTexture](Texture-
graphicsTexture.html) of [RenderTexture.active](RenderTexture-active.html).  
  
In order to set the active render target to a GraphicsTexture, it must have
[GraphicsTextureDescriptorFlags.RenderTarget](Rendering.GraphicsTextureDescriptorFlags.RenderTarget.html)
enabled in
[GraphicsTextureDescriptor.flags](Rendering.GraphicsTextureDescriptor-
flags.html) on texture creation.  
  
Setting `GraphicsTexture.active` is the same as calling
[Graphics.SetRenderTarget](Graphics.SetRenderTarget.html) with a single
GraphicsTexture. Typically you change or query the active render target when
implementing custom graphics effects; if all you need is to make a Camera
render into a texture, then use [Camera.targetTexture](Camera-
targetTexture.html) with a [RenderTexture](RenderTexture.html) instead.  
  
Additional resources:
[GraphicsTextureDescriptorFlags.RenderTarget](Rendering.GraphicsTextureDescriptorFlags.RenderTarget.html),
[Graphics.SetRenderTarget](Graphics.SetRenderTarget.html),
[RenderTexture.active](RenderTexture-active.html).

    using UnityEngine.Rendering;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    // Get the contents of a [GraphicsTexture](Rendering.GraphicsTexture.html) into a [Texture2D](Texture2D.html)
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        static public [Texture2D](Texture2D.html) GetGfxTexPixels([GraphicsTexture](Rendering.GraphicsTexture.html) gfxTex)
        {
            // Remember currently active render target
            [GraphicsTexture](Rendering.GraphicsTexture.html) currentActiveRT = [GraphicsTexture.active](Rendering.GraphicsTexture-active.html);  
      
            // Set the supplied [GraphicsTexture](Rendering.GraphicsTexture.html) as the active one
            [GraphicsTexture.active](Rendering.GraphicsTexture-active.html) = gfxTex;  
      
            // Create a new [Texture2D](Texture2D.html) and read the [GraphicsTexture](Rendering.GraphicsTexture.html) image into it
            [Texture2D](Texture2D.html) tex = new [Texture2D](Texture2D.html)(gfxTex.descriptor.width, gfxTex.descriptor.height);
            tex.ReadPixels(new [Rect](Rect.html)(0, 0, tex.width, tex.height), 0, 0);
            tex.Apply();  
      
            // Restore previously active render texture
            [GraphicsTexture.active](Rendering.GraphicsTexture-active.html) = currentActiveRT;
            return tex;
        }
    }
