### Description

Details about a specific point of contact involved in a 2D physics collision.

A contact point describes a point of intersection between two
[Collider2D](Collider2D.html). [ContactPoint2D](ContactPoint2D.html) can only
exist on [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) that are not set to be triggers as
triggers do not define contact points.  
  
Additional resources: [Collider2D.isTrigger](Collider2D-isTrigger.html),
[Physics2D.GetContacts](Physics2D.GetContacts.html),
[Rigidbody2D.GetContacts](Rigidbody2D.GetContacts.html),
[Collider2D.GetContacts](Collider2D.GetContacts.html) and
[Collision2D](Collision2D.html).

### Properties

[bounciness](ContactPoint2D-bounciness.html)| The effective bounciness used
for the ContactPoint2D.  
---|---  
[collider](ContactPoint2D-collider.html)| The incoming Collider2D involved in
the collision with the otherCollider.  
[enabled](ContactPoint2D-enabled.html)| Indicates whether the collision
response or reaction is enabled or disabled.  
[friction](ContactPoint2D-friction.html)| The effective friction used for the
ContactPoint2D.  
[normal](ContactPoint2D-normal.html)| Surface normal at the contact point.  
[normalImpulse](ContactPoint2D-normalImpulse.html)| Gets the impulse applied
at the contact point along the ContactPoint2D.normal.  
[otherCollider](ContactPoint2D-otherCollider.html)| The other Collider2D
involved in the collision with the collider.  
[otherRigidbody](ContactPoint2D-otherRigidbody.html)| The other Rigidbody2D
involved in the collision with the rigidbody.  
[point](ContactPoint2D-point.html)| The point of contact between the two
colliders in world space.  
[relativeVelocity](ContactPoint2D-relativeVelocity.html)| Gets the relative
velocity of the two colliders at the contact point (Read Only).  
[rigidbody](ContactPoint2D-rigidbody.html)| The incoming Rigidbody2D involved
in the collision with the otherRigidbody.  
[separation](ContactPoint2D-separation.html)| Gets the distance between the
colliders at the contact point.  
[tangentImpulse](ContactPoint2D-tangentImpulse.html)| Gets the impulse applied
at the contact point which is perpendicular to the ContactPoint2D.normal.
