### Parameters

position | Rectangle on the screen to use for the group.  
---|---  
text | Text to display on the group.  
image |  [Texture](Texture.html) to display on the group.  
content | Text, image and tooltip for this group. If supplied, any mouse clicks are "captured" by the group and not If left out, no background is rendered, and mouse clicks are passed.  
style | The style to use for the background.  
  
### Description

Begin a group. Must be matched with a call to [EndGroup](GUI.EndGroup.html).

When you begin a group, the coordinate system for GUI controls are set so
(0,0) is the top-left corner of the group. All controls are clipped to the
group. Groups can be nested - if they are, children are clipped to their
parents.  
  
This is very useful when moving a bunch of GUI elements around on screen. A
common use case is designing your menus to fit on a specific screen size, then
centering the GUI on larger displays. Additional resources: [matrix](GUI-
matrix.html), [BeginScrollView](GUI.BeginScrollView.html).

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void OnGUI()
        {
            // Constrain all drawing to be within a 800x600 pixel area centered on the screen.
            [GUI.BeginGroup](GUI.BeginGroup.html)(new [Rect](Rect.html)([Screen.width](Screen-width.html) / 2 - 400, [Screen.height](Screen-height.html) / 2 - 300, 800, 600));  
      
            // Draw a box in the new coordinate space defined by the BeginGroup.
            // Notice how (0,0) has now been moved on-screen
            [GUI.Box](GUI.Box.html)(new [Rect](Rect.html)(0, 0, 800, 600), "This box is now centered! - here you would put your main menu");  
      
            // We need to match all BeginGroup calls with an EndGroup
            [GUI.EndGroup](GUI.EndGroup.html)();
        }
    }
