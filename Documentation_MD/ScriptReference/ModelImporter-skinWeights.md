public [ModelImporterSkinWeights](ModelImporterSkinWeights.html) skinWeights;

### Description

Skin weights import options.

To import more than 4 bone weights per vertex, set this property to
[ModelImporterSkinWeights.Custom](ModelImporterSkinWeights.Custom.html) and
set [ModelImporter.maxBonesPerVertex](ModelImporter-maxBonesPerVertex.html) to
the required number. You may also limit the number of bones to less than 4, or
set a threshold for the weights via
[ModelImporter.minBoneWeight](ModelImporter-minBoneWeight.html).  
  
Note that [QualitySettings.skinWeights](QualitySettings-skinWeights.html) and
[SkinnedMeshRenderer.quality](SkinnedMeshRenderer-quality.html) can limit the
number of bone weights that Unity uses for skinning. Ensure that these values
are set to Auto, if you want to use more than 4 bone weights per vertex.
