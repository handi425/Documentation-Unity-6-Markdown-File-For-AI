## Declaration

public void
Prepare([LightTransport.IDeviceContext](LightTransport.IDeviceContext.html)
context, [LightTransport.IWorld](LightTransport.IWorld.html) world,
BufferSlice<Vector3> positions, float pushoff, int bounceCount);

### Parameters

world | World.  
---|---  
positions | BufferSlice containing the probe positions to integrate.  
pushoff | The offset to add to the rays traced from each probe position. You can use this parameter to prevent self-intersections when 32 bit floating point precision is an issue, for instance when integrating a large open world.  
bounceCount | Number of light bounces.  
  
### Description

Prepare the integrator.

The preparation can take a significant time if the world is large or OpenCL
kernels haven't been written to cache yet.
