## Declaration

public static int SphereCastNonAlloc([Vector3](Vector3.html) origin, float
radius, [Vector3](Vector3.html) direction, RaycastHit[] results, float
maxDistance = Mathf.Infinity, int layerMask = DefaultRaycastLayers,
[QueryTriggerInteraction](QueryTriggerInteraction.html)
queryTriggerInteraction = QueryTriggerInteraction.UseGlobal);

### Parameters

origin | The center of the sphere at the start of the sweep.  
---|---  
radius | The radius of the sphere.  
direction | The direction in which to sweep the sphere.  
results | The buffer to save the hits into.  
maxDistance | The max length of the sweep.  
layerMask | A [Layer mask](../Manual/Layers.html) that is used to selectively ignore colliders when casting a sphere.  
queryTriggerInteraction | Specifies whether this query should hit Triggers.  
  
### Returns

**int** The amount of hits stored into the `results` buffer.

### Description

Cast sphere along the direction and store the results into buffer.

This is variant of [Physics.SphereCastAll](Physics.SphereCastAll.html), but
instead of allocating the array with the results of the query, it stores the
results into the user-provided array. It will only compute as many hits as fit
into the buffer, and store them in no particular order. It's not guaranteed
that it will store only the closest hits. Generates no garbage.

## Declaration

public static int SphereCastNonAlloc([Ray](Ray.html) ray, float radius,
RaycastHit[] results, float maxDistance = Mathf.Infinity, int layerMask =
DefaultRaycastLayers, [QueryTriggerInteraction](QueryTriggerInteraction.html)
queryTriggerInteraction = QueryTriggerInteraction.UseGlobal);

### Parameters

ray | The starting point and direction of the ray into which the sphere sweep is cast.  
---|---  
radius | The radius of the sphere.  
results | The buffer to save the results to.  
maxDistance | The max length of the sweep.  
layerMask | A [Layer mask](../Manual/Layers.html) that is used to selectively ignore colliders when casting a sphere.  
queryTriggerInteraction | Specifies whether this query should hit Triggers.  
  
### Returns

**int** The amount of hits stored into the `results` buffer.

### Description

Cast sphere along the direction and store the results into buffer.
