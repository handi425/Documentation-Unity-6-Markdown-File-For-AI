### Description

Attribute to make a string be edited with a height-flexible and scrollable
text area.

You can specify the minimum and maximum lines for the TextArea, and the field
will expand according to the size of the text. A scrollbar will appear if the
text is bigger than the area available.  
  
**Note:** The maximum lines refers to the maximum size of the TextArea. There
is no maximum to the number of lines entered by the user.
