public float linearDamping;

### Description

The linear damping of the Rigidbody2D linear velocity.

Damping can be used to reduce the magnitude of the
[Rigidbody2D.linearVelocity](Rigidbody2D-linearVelocity.html) (linear speed)
of a [Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) over time.  
  
Zero indicates that no damping should be used whereas higher values increase
the damping, effectively slowing down the linear motion faster. Unlike contact
friction, linear damping is always applied.  
  
**Note:** The following formula is how the linear damping is applied:
`linearVelocity *= 1.0f / ( 1.0f + simulation-time-step * linearDamping )`

    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        private [Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) rb;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            rb = GetComponent<[Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html)>();
        }  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            if ([Input.GetButton](Input.GetButton.html)("Fire1"))
                OpenParachute();  
      
            if ([Input.GetButton](Input.GetButton.html)("space"))
                CloseParachute();
        }  
      
        void OpenParachute()
        {
            // Set a large damping to simulate an open parachute.
            rb.linearDamping = 20f;
        }  
      
        void CloseParachute()
        {
            // Turn-off damping to simulate a closed parachute.
            rb.linearDamping = 0f;
        }
    }
