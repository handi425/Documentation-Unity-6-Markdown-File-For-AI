### Description

Describes options for displaying movie playback controls.

**Windows Store Apps** : OS doesn't provide a **Stop** button control because
of this Unity will stop a video if **Escape** or **Back Button** is pressed if
video is launched with
[FullScreenMovieControlMode.Full](FullScreenMovieControlMode.Full.html) or
[FullScreenMovieControlMode.Minimal](FullScreenMovieControlMode.Minimal.html)
parameters.

### Properties

[Full](FullScreenMovieControlMode.Full.html)| Display the standard controls
for controlling movie playback.  
---|---  
[Minimal](FullScreenMovieControlMode.Minimal.html)| Display minimal set of
controls controlling movie playback.  
[CancelOnInput](FullScreenMovieControlMode.CancelOnInput.html)| Do not display
any controls, but cancel movie playback if input occurs.  
[Hidden](FullScreenMovieControlMode.Hidden.html)| Do not display any controls.
