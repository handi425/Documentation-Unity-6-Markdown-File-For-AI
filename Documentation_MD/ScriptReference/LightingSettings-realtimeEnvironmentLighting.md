[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-LightingSettings.html "Go to
LightingSettings Component in the Manual")

public bool realtimeEnvironmentLighting;

### Description

Determines the lightmap that Unity stores environment lighting in.

Use this option to specify which type of lightmap contains the environment
lighting, when your Scene uses both the Baked Global Illumination system and
the Enlighten Realtime Global Illumination system.  
  
When this is set to `true`, Unity stores environment lighting in real-time
lightmaps. When this is set to `false`, Unity stores environment lighting data
in baked lightmaps.  
  
This setting affects lightmaps generated by the Baked Global Illumination
system and the Enlighten Realtime Global Illumination system.  
  
When Unity serializes this `LightingSettings` object as a [Lighting Settings
Asset](../Manual/class-LightingSettings.html), this property corresponds to
the **Realtime Environment Lighting** property in the Lighting Settings Asset
Inspector.  
  
Additional resources: [Lighting Settings Asset](../Manual/class-
LightingSettings.html).
