public [LayerMask](LayerMask.html) forceReceiveLayers;

### Description

The Layers that this [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) can receive forces from
during a Collision contact with another [Collider2D](Collider2D.html).

When a collision occurs between two [Collider2D](Collider2D.html), both
Colliders would normally receive a force from each other that separates them.
Both Colliders have a Layer assigned to them respectively, which can be the
same or different Layer(s). For the forces to apply, each Collider must send a
force to the Layer that is assigned to the other Collider, while also
receiving a force on their own Layer from the other Collider. Thus, both
Colliders must mutually agree on which Layers the forces are being sent and
received.  
  
The [forceReceiveLayers](Collider2D-forceReceiveLayers.html) property allows
you to select which Layers that the Collider receives force from, while
[forceSendLayers](Collider2D-forceSendLayers.html) allows you to select which
Layers the Collider sends a force to.  
  
**NOTES** :

  * Because forces only relate to a Collision contact, this features does not apply when either [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) is set to be a trigger via [Collider2D.isTrigger](Collider2D-isTrigger.html) and does not affect mutual forces applied by a [Joint2D](Joint2D.html).
  * Any [Rigidbody2D.bodyType](Rigidbody2D-bodyType.html) can send forces; however, only a [Dynamic Body Type](RigidbodyType2D.Dynamic.html) can receive forces. Neither [Kinematic Body Type](RigidbodyType2D.Kinematic.html) nor [Static Body Type](RigidbodyType2D.Static.html) can receive forces.
  * Forces being sent and received do not affect Collision callbacks which are still called even if no forces are applied.
  * During a Collision callback, any impulses reported by [ContactPoint2D.normalImpulse](ContactPoint2D-normalImpulse.html) or [ContactPoint2D.tangentImpulse](ContactPoint2D-tangentImpulse.html) will be the impulses that would have been applied if [forceSendLayers](Collider2D-forceSendLayers.html) and [forceReceiveLayers](Collider2D-forceReceiveLayers.html) were not used.
