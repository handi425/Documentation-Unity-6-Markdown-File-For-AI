public [Vector3](Vector3.html) normal;

### Description

The normal of the surface the ray hit.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        // Calculate the reflection of a "laser beam" off a clicked object.  
      
        // The object from which the beam is fired. The incoming beam will
        // not be visible if the camera is used for this!
