SketchUpImporter Component in the Manual")

## Declaration

public SketchUpImportScene[] GetScenes();

### Returns

**SketchUpImportScene[]** Array of scenes extracted from a SketchUp file.

### Description

The method returns an array of SketchUpImportScene which represents SketchUp
scenes.

[SketchUpImportScene](SketchUpImportScene.html) is the structure to represent
the Scene that was extracted from the SketchUp file.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);  
      
    public class SketchUpUtility
    {
        public static void PrintSketchUpSceneName([GameObject](GameObject.html) go)
        {
            string assetPath = [AssetDatabase.GetAssetPath](AssetDatabase.GetAssetPath.html)(go); // get asset path
            // get [SketchUpImporter](SketchUpImporter.html)
            [SketchUpImporter](SketchUpImporter.html) importer = [AssetImporter.GetAtPath](AssetImporter.GetAtPath.html)(assetPath) as [SketchUpImporter](SketchUpImporter.html);
            if (importer == null)
            {
                [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("This object is not imported by [SketchUpImporter](SketchUpImporter.html)");
                return;
            }  
      
            [SketchUpImportScene](SketchUpImportScene.html)[] scenes = importer.GetScenes();  // get all the scenes  
      
            foreach ([SketchUpImportScene](SketchUpImportScene.html) scene in scenes)
            {
                [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)(scene.name);
            }
        }
    }
    

The above example takes a GameObject that is imported from a SketchUp file and
prints the name of the scenes in the SketchUp file.
