### Description

Describes a ModifierBox source for use with
[NavMeshBuildSource](AI.NavMeshBuildSource.html).

This shape changes the area type of the walkable surface inside the box.
Because this modification happens in a voxel representation of the scene,
NavMesh does not follow the outline of the box precisely. If several
ModifierBoxes overlap, and have different area types, the area type with the
highest index takes precedence. A ModifierBox that you set to Not Walkable
takes precedence over any other ModifierBoxes, regardless of their area type.
This is useful when you need to block out an area.
