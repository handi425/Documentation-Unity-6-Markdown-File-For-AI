## Declaration

public static [TerrainTools.PaintContext](TerrainTools.PaintContext.html)
CollectNormals([Terrain](Terrain.html) terrain, [Rect](Rect.html)
boundsInTerrainSpace, int extraBorderPixels = 0, bool fillOutsideTerrain =
true);

### Parameters

terrain | Reference Terrain tile.  
---|---  
boundsInTerrainSpace | The region in terrain space from which to collect normals.  
extraBorderPixels | Number of extra border pixels required.  
fillOutsideTerrain | Whether to fill empty space outside of Terrain tiles with data from the nearest tile.  
  
### Returns

**PaintContext** PaintContext containing the combined normalmap data for the
specified region.

### Description

Helper function to set up a PaintContext that collects mesh normal data from
one or more Terrain tiles.

CollectNormals identifies all of the normalmap pixels that are within
`extraBorderPixels` of the bounds rectangle. The search is performed across
adjacent connected Terrain tiles. The pixels are collected into a temporary
render texture and stored in
[PaintContext.sourceRenderTexture](TerrainTools.PaintContext-
sourceRenderTexture.html).  
  
Important: there is no corresponding function to write modified normalmap data
back to the Terrain tiles, because the normalmap is not stored; it is
calculated from the heightmap.  
  
Once you are done using the sourceRenderTexture, you must call
[TerrainPaintUtility.ReleaseContextResources](TerrainTools.TerrainPaintUtility.ReleaseContextResources.html)
to release the RenderTexture resources.  
  
Additional resources:
[PaintContext.GatherNormals](TerrainTools.PaintContext.GatherNormals.html) and
[PaintContext](TerrainTools.PaintContext.html).
