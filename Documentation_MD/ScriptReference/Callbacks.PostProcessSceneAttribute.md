### Description

Add this attribute to a method to get a notification just after building the
Scene.

A method with this attribute will also get called when entering Playmode, when
[SceneManager.LoadScene](SceneManagement.SceneManager.LoadScene.html) is
called.  
  
`PostProcessSceneAttribute` has an option to provide an order index in the
callback, starting at 0. This is useful if you have more than one
OnPostprocessScene callback, and you would like them to be called in a certain
order. Callbacks are called in order, starting at zero.  
  
**Note:** If there are no new changes to the scene since the previous Player
build, Unity doesn't rebuild the scene but uses cached Player data instead. In
this case the `PostProcessSceneAttribute` callback is not called. To ensure an
unchanged scene rebuilds, you can either mark the scene dirty with
[EditorSceneManager.MarkSceneDirty](SceneManagement.EditorSceneManager.MarkSceneDirty.html)
or clear the build cache with
[BuildOptions.CleanBuildCache](BuildOptions.CleanBuildCache.html).

    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);
    using UnityEditor.Callbacks;  
      
    public class MyScenePostprocessor {
        [[PostProcessSceneAttribute](Callbacks.PostProcessSceneAttribute.html) (2)]
        public static void OnPostprocessScene() {
            [GameObject](GameObject.html) cube = [GameObject.CreatePrimitive](GameObject.CreatePrimitive.html)([PrimitiveType.Cube](PrimitiveType.Cube.html));
            cube.transform.position = new [Vector3](Vector3.html)(0.0f, 0.5f, 0.0f);
        }
    }
