## Declaration

public [Vector3](Vector3.html) InverseTransformVector([Vector3](Vector3.html)
vector);

### Description

Transforms a `vector` from world space to local space. The opposite of
[Transform.TransformVector](Transform.TransformVector.html).

This operation is not affected by position of the transform but it is affected
by scale. The returned vector may have a different length than `vector`.  
  
If you need to transform many vectors at once consider using
[Transform.InverseTransformVectors](Transform.InverseTransformVectors.html)
instead as it is much faster than repeatedly calling this function.
