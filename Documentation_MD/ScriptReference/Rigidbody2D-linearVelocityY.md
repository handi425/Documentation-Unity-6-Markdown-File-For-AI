public float linearVelocityY;

### Description

The Y component of the linear velocity of the Rigidbody2D in world-units per
second.

The linear velocity is specified as a [Vector2](Vector2.html) with components
in the X and Y directions (there is no Z direction in 2D physics).  
  
This property lets you read or write the Y component of the
[Rigidbody2D.linearVelocity](Rigidbody2D-linearVelocity.html) separately
without affecting the X component of the
[Rigidbody2D.linearVelocity](Rigidbody2D-linearVelocity.html). This can be
convenient when dealing with only X or Y directions in isolation.  
  
Additional resources:
[Rigidbody2D.linearVelocity](Rigidbody2D-linearVelocity.html) and
[Rigidbody2D.linearVelocityX](Rigidbody2D-linearVelocityX.html).

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    // Ensure that the maximum vertical speed moving up isn't larger than the configurable value.
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public float MaximumVerticalSpeed = 2f;  
      
        private [Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) rb;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            rb = GetComponent<[Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html)>();
        }  
      
        void [FixedUpdate](PlayerLoop.FixedUpdate.html)()
        {
            // Clamp the vertical speed.
            if (rb.linearVelocityY > MaximumVerticalSpeed)
            {
                rb.linearVelocityY = MaximumVerticalSpeed;
            }
        }
    }
