## Declaration

public static [Matrix4x4](Matrix4x4.html) Frustum(float left, float right,
float bottom, float top, float zNear, float zFar);

## Declaration

public static [Matrix4x4](Matrix4x4.html)
Frustum([FrustumPlanes](FrustumPlanes.html) fp);

### Parameters

left | The X coordinate of the left side of the near projection plane in view space.  
---|---  
right | The X coordinate of the right side of the near projection plane in view space.  
bottom | The Y coordinate of the bottom side of the near projection plane in view space.  
top | The Y coordinate of the top side of the near projection plane in view space.  
zNear | Z distance to the near plane from the origin in view space.  
zFar | Z distance to the far plane from the origin in view space.  
frustumPlanes | Frustum planes struct that contains the view space coordinates of that define a viewing frustum.  
  
### Returns

**Matrix4x4** A projection matrix with a viewing frustum defined by the plane
coordinates passed in.

### Description

This function returns a projection matrix with viewing frustum that has a near
plane defined by the coordinates that were passed in.

The corners of the near plane of the viewing frustum of the projection matrix
are as follows:  
top-left : (left, top, zNear)  
top-right : (right, top, zNear)  
bottom-right : (right, bottom, zNear)  
bottom-left : (left, bottom, zNear)  
  
The returned matrix embeds a z-flip operation whose purpose is to cancel the
z-flip performed by the camera view matrix. If the view matrix is an identity
or some custom matrix that doesn't perform a z-flip, consider multiplying the
third column of the projection matrix (i.e. m02, m12, m22 and m32) by -1.
