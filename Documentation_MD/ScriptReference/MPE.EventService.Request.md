## Declaration

public static void Request(string eventType, Action<Exception,object[]>
promiseHandler, object[] args, long timeoutInMs,
[MPE.EventDataSerialization](MPE.EventDataSerialization.html)
eventDataSerialization);

### Parameters

eventType | The request's event type name.  
---|---  
promiseHandler | The handler called when the Request is either fulfilled or cancelled, or times out.  
args | Arguments sent with the request event.  
timeoutInMs | The timeout value in milliseconds. After this amount of time passes the Request is considered to be cancelled.  
eventDataSerialization | Specifies how to serialize the request's arguments. This can be standard JSON, or JSON annotated with JsonUtility. You can use the latter to convert the argument to a concrete Unity object that supports [JsonUtility.FromJson](JsonUtility.FromJson.html).  
  
### Description

Sends a request to all connected clients on the "events" channel.

Any client can attempt fulfill the request but only the first client that
acknowledges the request can actually fulfill it.
