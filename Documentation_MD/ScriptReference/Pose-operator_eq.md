public static bool operator ==([Pose](Pose.html) a, [Pose](Pose.html) b);

### Description

Returns true if two poses are equal.

The equals operator returns true if two Poses are equivalent. Equivalent in
this sense is determined by calling into the Equal operators of the internal
Quaternion and Vector members of the pose. If both Quaternion and Vector
members are deemed equal, then the two poses are equivalent.
