## Declaration

public static void DrawPolyLine(params Vector3[] points);

**Note:** Use [HandleUtility.GetHandleSize](HandleUtility.GetHandleSize.html)
where you might want to have constant screen-sized handles.  
  
![](../StaticFiles/ScriptRefImages/DrawPolyLine.png)  
_PolyLine that connects all the objects in the Scene View._

    
    
    // Draw lines between selected GameObjects.  
      
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    [[CustomEditor](CustomEditor.html)(typeof(DrawPolyLineExample))]
    public class PolyLineDraw : [Editor](Editor.html)
    {
        private [Vector3](Vector3.html)[] positions;  
      
        void OnSceneGUI()
        {
            DrawPolyLineExample connectedObjects = target as DrawPolyLineExample;
            if (connectedObjects.objs == null)
            {
                return;
            }  
      
            if (connectedObjects.objs.Length > 0)
            {
                positions = new [Vector3](Vector3.html)[connectedObjects.objs.Length];
            }  
      
            for (var i = 0; i < connectedObjects.objs.Length; i++)
            {
                if (connectedObjects.objs[i])
                {
                    positions[i] = connectedObjects.objs[i].transform.position;
                }
                else
                {
                    positions[i] = [Vector3.zero](Vector3-zero.html);
                }
            }  
      
            [Handles.DrawPolyLine](Handles.DrawPolyLine.html)(positions);
        }
    }
    

And the script attached to this handle:

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class DrawPolyLineExample : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public [GameObject](GameObject.html)[] objs;
    }
