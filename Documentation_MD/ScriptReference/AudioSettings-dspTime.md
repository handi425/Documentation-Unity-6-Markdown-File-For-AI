Component in the Manual")

public static double dspTime;

### Description

Returns the current time of the audio system.

This is a value specified in seconds and based on the actual number of samples
the audio system processes and is therefore much more precise than the time
obtained via the [Time.time](Time-time.html) property.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    // The code example shows how to implement a metronome that procedurally generates the click sounds via the OnAudioFilterRead callback.
    // While the game is paused or suspended, this time will not be updated and sounds playing will be paused. Therefore developers of music scheduling routines do not have to do any rescheduling after the app is unpaused
