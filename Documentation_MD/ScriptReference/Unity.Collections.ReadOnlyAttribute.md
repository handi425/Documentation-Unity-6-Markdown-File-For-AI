### Description

Marks a member of a struct used in a job as read-only.

Native containers are read-write by default when used in a job. This means
that you can't schedule two jobs that reference the same containers
simultaneously. Add the ReadOnly attribute to a native container field in a
job struct to mark the container as read-only. This allows two jobs to run in
parallel and read data from the same native container.
