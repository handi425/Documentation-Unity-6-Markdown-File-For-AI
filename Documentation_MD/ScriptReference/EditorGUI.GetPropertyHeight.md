## Declaration

public static float
GetPropertyHeight([SerializedProperty](SerializedProperty.html) property, bool
includeChildren);

## Declaration

public static float
GetPropertyHeight([SerializedPropertyType](SerializedPropertyType.html) type,
[GUIContent](GUIContent.html) label);

## Declaration

public static float
GetPropertyHeight([SerializedProperty](SerializedProperty.html) property,
[GUIContent](GUIContent.html) label = null, bool includeChildren = true);

### Parameters

property | Height of the property area.  
---|---  
label | Descriptive text or image.  
includeChildren | Should the returned height include the height of child properties?  
  
### Description

Get the height needed for a [PropertyField](EditorGUI.PropertyField.html)
control.

The height is based on the type of the SerializedProperty, and inclues the
height of all expanded children if the includeChildren parameter is set to
true, which is the default. If the property has a custom PropertyDrawer, the
function will return the height returned by that drawer. The includeChildren
parameter is ignored in that case, as PropertyDrawers always include children.
