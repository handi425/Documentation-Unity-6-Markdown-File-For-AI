## Declaration

public GlobalKeyword(string name);

### Parameters

name | The name of the global shader keyword.  
---|---  
  
### Description

Creates and returns a GlobalKeyword struct that represents an existing global
shader keyword.

If a global shader keyword with the given name exists in Unity's internal list
of global shader keywords, Unity creates and returns a `GlobalKeyword` struct
to represent it. Otherwise, Unity still creates a struct, but throws an error.  
  
To add a new global shader keyword to Unity's internal list at the same time
as creating a `GlobalKeyword` to represent it, use
[GlobalKeyword.Create](Rendering.GlobalKeyword.Create.html) instead.  
  
To get all the global shader keywords that already exist, use
[Shader.globalKeywords](Shader-globalKeywords.html).
