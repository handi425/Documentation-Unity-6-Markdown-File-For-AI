## Declaration

public static bool IsTouching([Collider2D](Collider2D.html) collider1,
[Collider2D](Collider2D.html) collider2);

### Parameters

collider1 | The Collider to check if it is touching `collider2`.  
---|---  
collider2 | The Collider to check if it is touching `collider1`.  
  
### Returns

**bool** Whether `collider1` is touching `collider2` or not.

### Description

Checks whether the passed Colliders are in contact or not.

It is important to understand that checking whether Colliders are touching or
not is performed against the last physics engine update; that is the state of
touching Colliders at that time. If you have just added a new
[Collider2D](Collider2D.html) or have moved a [Collider2D](Collider2D.html)
but a physics update has not yet taken place then the Colliders will not be
shown as touching. This function returns the same collision results as the
physics collision or trigger callbacks.

## Declaration

public static bool IsTouching([Collider2D](Collider2D.html) collider,
[ContactFilter2D](ContactFilter2D.html) contactFilter);

### Parameters

Collider | The Collider to check if it is touching any other Collider filtered by the `contactFilter`.  
---|---  
contactFilter | The contact filter used to filter the results differently, such as by layer mask, Z depth, or normal angle.  
  
### Returns

**bool** Whether the `Collider` is touching any other Collider filtered by the
`contactFilter` or not.
