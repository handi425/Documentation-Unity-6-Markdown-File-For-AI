public bool maximized;

### Description

Whether or not this window is maximized?

To maximize the custome Editor window to the size of the Unity screen, set
`maximized`. It works only when the custom Editor window is docked within
Unity.

    
    
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.UIElements;
    
    public class MaximizedExample : [EditorWindow](EditorWindow.html)
    {
        [[MenuItem](MenuItem.html)("Examples/Maximized Window Example")]
        public static void ShowExample()
        {
            MaximizedExample wnd = GetWindow<MaximizedExample>();
            wnd.titleContent = new [GUIContent](GUIContent.html)("MaximizedExample");
        }
    
        public void CreateGUI()
        {
            var toggle = new [Toggle](UIElements.Toggle.html)("Maximize window");
            toggle.value = this.maximized;
            rootVisualElement.Add(toggle);
        }
    }
