## Declaration

public TileBase[] GetTilesBlock([BoundsInt](BoundsInt.html) bounds);

### Parameters

bounds | The bounds to retrieve from.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**TileBase[]** The array of [Tile](Tilemaps.Tile.html)s at the given bounds.

### Description

Retrieves an array of Tiles with the given bounds.

This is meant for more a performant way to get Tiles as a batch, when compared
to calling GetTile for every single position. The bounds size must match the
array size. For example bounds of 1x2x3 needs an array length of 6.

    
    
    // Retrieves all Tiles from an area on the [Tilemap](Tilemaps.Tilemap.html) and prints out the Tiles to console
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.Tilemaps;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public [BoundsInt](BoundsInt.html) area;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            [Tilemap](Tilemaps.Tilemap.html) tilemap = GetComponent<[Tilemap](Tilemaps.Tilemap.html)>();
            [TileBase](Tilemaps.TileBase.html)[] tileArray = tilemap.GetTilesBlock(area);
            for (int index = 0; index < tileArray.Length; index++)
            {
                print(tileArray[index]);
            }
        }
    }
