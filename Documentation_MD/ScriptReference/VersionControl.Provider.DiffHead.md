## Declaration

public static [VersionControl.Task](VersionControl.Task.html)
DiffHead([VersionControl.AssetList](VersionControl.AssetList.html) assets,
bool includingMetaFiles);

### Parameters

assets | List of assets to diff.  
---|---  
includingMetaFiles | Whether or not to include the .meta file.  
  
### Description

Starts a task for showing a diff of the given assest versus their head
revision.

Do note that some asset types do not save their changes to disk right after
making them so it is recommended to manually save the asset using
[AssetDatabase.SaveAssets](AssetDatabase.SaveAssets.html) before calling the
diff tool.

    
    
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);
    using UnityEditor.VersionControl;
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class EditorScript : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        [[MenuItem](MenuItem.html)("Version Control/Diff")]
        public static void ExampleDiff()
        {
            [AssetList](VersionControl.AssetList.html) assets = new [AssetList](VersionControl.AssetList.html)();
            assets.Add([Provider.GetAssetByPath](VersionControl.Provider.GetAssetByPath.html)("Assets/ExampleAsset.cs"));
            [AssetDatabase.SaveAssets](AssetDatabase.SaveAssets.html)();
            [Provider.DiffHead](VersionControl.Provider.DiffHead.html)(assets, includingMetaFiles: false);
        }
    }
