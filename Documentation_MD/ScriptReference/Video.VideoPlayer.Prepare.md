## Declaration

public void Prepare();

### Description

Prepares the playback engine so that it's ready for playback.

To prepare, the playback engine reserves the resources vital for playback, and
preloads some of the content to be played. If the preparation succeeds, this
method emits the [VideoPlayer.prepareCompleted](Video.VideoPlayer-
prepareCompleted.html) event and sets
[VideoPlayer.isPrepared](Video.VideoPlayer-isPrepared.html) to `true`. The
VideoPlayer is then ready to display the frames immediately and you can access
all properties related to the source.  
  
If you don't prepare the VideoPlayer before you play a video, the
[VideoPlayer.Play](Video.VideoPlayer.Play.html) method will do the preparation
but the video won't play instantly. If you use
[VideoPlayer.Stop](Video.VideoPlayer.Stop.html), the VideoPlayer becomes
unprepared again because it frees its resources for performance reasons. To
halt a video but keep its preparation, use
[VideoPlayer.Pause](Video.VideoPlayer.Pause.html) instead.  
  
Additional resources: [VideoPlayer.isPrepared](Video.VideoPlayer-
isPrepared.html).
