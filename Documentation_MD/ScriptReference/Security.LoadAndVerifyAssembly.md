**Obsolete** This was an internal method which is no longer used.

## Declaration

public static [Compilation.Assembly](Compilation.Assembly.html)
LoadAndVerifyAssembly(byte[] assemblyData);

### Parameters

assemblyData | Assembly to verify.  
---|---  
authorizationKey | Public key used to verify assembly.  
  
### Returns

**Assembly** Loaded, verified, assembly, or null if the assembly cannot be
verfied.

### Description

Loads an assembly and checks that it is allowed to be used in the webplayer.
(Web Player is no Longer Supported).

This function used to relate to the chain of trust system used by the
webplayer in earlier versions of unity.  
  
The single argument version of this API will always issue an error message. An
authorisation key is always needed.  
  
Note that web player is not supported from 5.4.0, so this function no longer
serves a purpose and will be deprecated.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
