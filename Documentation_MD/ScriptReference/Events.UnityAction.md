## Declaration

public delegate void UnityAction();

### Description

Zero argument delegate used by UnityEvents.

Use this to create some dynamic functionality in your scripts. Unity Actions
allow you to dynamically call multiple functions. Since Unity Actions have no
arguments, functions they call must also have no arguments. See [Delegates
](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/scripting/delegates) for more
information.

    //This script will change the [Color](Color.html) of the [GameObject](GameObject.html) as well as output messages to the Console saying which function was run by the [UnityAction](Events.UnityAction.html).
