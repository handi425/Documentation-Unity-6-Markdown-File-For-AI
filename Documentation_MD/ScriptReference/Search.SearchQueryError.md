### Description

Represents a query parsing error.

This class is only used in the context of
[SearchProviders](Search.SearchProvider.html), when performing a search. It
allows a [SearchProvider](Search.SearchProvider.html) to report error during
the parsing of the search query. Here is an example of a
[SearchProvider](Search.SearchProvider.html) that uses a
[QueryEngine](Search.QueryEngine_1.html) and reports parsing errors:

    
    
    public IEnumerable<T> Search([SearchContext](Search.SearchContext.html) context, [SearchProvider](Search.SearchProvider.html) provider, IEnumerable<T> subset = null)
    {
        var query = m_QueryEngine.ParseQuery(context.searchQuery, true);
        if (!query.valid)
        {
            if (reportError)
                context.AddSearchQueryErrors(query.errors.Select(e => new [SearchQueryError](Search.SearchQueryError.html)(e, context, provider)));
            return Enumerable.Empty<T>();
        }
    
        m_DoFuzzyMatch = query.HasToggle("fuzzy");
        IEnumerable<T> gameObjects = subset ?? m_Objects;
        return query.Apply(gameObjects, false);
    }
    

In the previous example, the function "Search" would be called by the
provider's [fetchItem](Search.SearchProvider.fetchItem.html).  
  
In the Search window, the errors are shown when there is no result available.
