[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-AudioSource.html "Go to AudioSource
Component in the Manual")

public float spread;

### Description

Sets the spread angle (in degrees) of a 3d stereo or multichannel sound in
speaker space.

0 = all sound channels are located at the same speaker location and is 'mono'.
360 = all subchannels are located at the opposite speaker location to the
speaker location that it should be according to 3D position. Default = 0.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        // when any [AudioSource](AudioSource.html) goes trough this transform, it will set it as 'mono'
        // and will restore the value to 3D effect after exiting
        // Make sure the audio source has a collider.
        void OnTriggerEnter([Collider](Collider.html) other)
        {
            [AudioSource](AudioSource.html) audio = other.GetComponent<[AudioSource](AudioSource.html)>();  
      
            if (audio)
            {
                audio.spread = 0;
            }
        }  
      
        void OnTriggerExit([Collider](Collider.html) other)
        {
            [AudioSource](AudioSource.html) audio = other.GetComponent<[AudioSource](AudioSource.html)>();  
      
            if (audio)
            {
                audio.spread = 360;
            }
        }
    }
