### Description

Use the Direct enum to directly render your application from the main thread.

In this rendering threading mode, the main thread processes your application's
high-level code, and directly converts it into the target platform's low-level
graphics API commands.  
  
On some platforms you can test this mode by passing the command line argument
`-force-gfx-jobs legacy` to an application built with BuildSettings option
[BuildOptions.Development](BuildOptions.Development.html).
