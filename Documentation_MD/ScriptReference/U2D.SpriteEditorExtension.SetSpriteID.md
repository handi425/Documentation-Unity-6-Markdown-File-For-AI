## Declaration

public static void SetSpriteID([Sprite](Sprite.html) sprite, GUID guid);

### Parameters

sprite | The Sprite to set.  
---|---  
guid | The GUID to set for the Sprite.  
  
### Description

Sets a [Sprite](Sprite.html)'s Global Unique Identifier (GUID) for easy
identification later.

During Sprite Asset generation, you can manually set a [Sprite's](Sprite.html)
SpriteID to identify the [Sprite](Sprite.html) from the data that was used to
generate it.  
  
This is usually needed when [Sprites](Sprite.html) are generated by
[ScriptedImporter](AssetImporters.ScriptedImporter.html) via
[Sprite.Create](Sprite.Create.html) and the
[ScriptedImporter](AssetImporters.ScriptedImporter.html) wants to support
SpriteEditorModuleBase that uses [AssetPostprocessor](AssetPostprocessor.html)
to modify during [Sprite](Sprite.html) generation.
