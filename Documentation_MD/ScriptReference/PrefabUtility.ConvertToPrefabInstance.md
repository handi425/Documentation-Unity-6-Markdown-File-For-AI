## Declaration

public static void ConvertToPrefabInstance([GameObject](GameObject.html)
plainGameObject, [GameObject](GameObject.html) prefabAssetRoot,
[ConvertToPrefabInstanceSettings](ConvertToPrefabInstanceSettings.html)
settings, [InteractionMode](InteractionMode.html) mode);

### Parameters

plainGameObject | The GameObject that will be converted to a Prefab instance.  
---|---  
prefabAssetRoot | The Prefab Asset used to create the Prefab instance from.  
settings | Settings to control the conversion.  
mode | Using UserAction will record undo and show dialogs if needed.  
  
### Description

Convert the plain GameObject to a Prefab instance using the provided Prefab
Asset root object.

This function will keep the root GameObject position, rotation and scale in
the Scene but merge the contents from the new Prefab Asset. When using
[ObjectMatchMode.ByName](ObjectMatchMode.ByName.html) object matching is
performed. When a match is found references to this object will survive the
conversion. Note that matching cannot be performed for GameObjects with
duplicate names in each of the input GameObject hierarchies.
