## Declaration

public void Pause();

### Description

Pauses the playback and leaves the current time intact.

Use this method to pause the playback of a video. This method sets
[VideoPlayer.isPlaying](Video.VideoPlayer-isPlaying.html) to `false`. To play
again, use [VideoPlayer.Play](Video.VideoPlayer.Play.html).  
  
If you pause the video when the VideoPlayer isn't prepared, this method
triggers preparation and shows the first frame of the video.  
  
If you seek through to a different point in the video and then call `Pause()`
before the VideoPlayer finishes preparation, it triggers preparation and shows
the frame that was the seek target. For example, if you set
[VideoPlayer.time](Video.VideoPlayer-time.html) to `10.0f` and then call
`Pause()`, it shows the frame at 10 seconds.
