in the Manual")

## Declaration

public void AddRelativeForce([Vector3](Vector3.html) force,
[ForceMode](ForceMode.html) mode = ForceMode.Force);

### Parameters

force | Force vector in local coordinates.  
---|---  
  
### Description

Adds a force to the rigidbody relative to its coordinate system.

Force can be applied only to an active rigidbody. If a GameObject is inactive,
AddRelativeForce has no effect.  
  
Wakes up the Rigidbody by default. If the force size is zero then the
Rigidbody will not be woken up.  
  
For more information on how ForceMode affects velocity, see
[Rigidbody.AddForce](Rigidbody.AddForce.html).  
  
Additional resources: [AddForce](Rigidbody.AddForce.html),
[AddForceAtPosition](Rigidbody.AddForceAtPosition.html),
[AddRelativeTorque](Rigidbody.AddRelativeTorque.html).

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    // Add a thrust force to push an object in its current forward
    // direction (to simulate a rocket motor, say).
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public float thrust;
        public [Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html) rb;
        void Start()
        {
            rb = GetComponent<[Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html)>();
        }  
      
        void [FixedUpdate](PlayerLoop.FixedUpdate.html)()
        {
            rb.AddRelativeForce([Vector3.forward](Vector3-forward.html) * thrust);
        }
    }

## Declaration

public void AddRelativeForce(float x, float y, float z,
[ForceMode](ForceMode.html) mode = ForceMode.Force);

### Parameters

x | Size of force along the local x-axis.  
---|---  
y | Size of force along the local y-axis.  
z | Size of force along the local z-axis.  
  
### Description

Adds a force to the rigidbody relative to its coordinate system.

Force can be applied only to an active rigidbody. If a GameObject is inactive,
AddRelativeForce has no effect.  
  
Wakes up the Rigidbody by default. If the force size is zero then the
Rigidbody will not be woken up.
