[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-Rigidbody.html "Go to Rigidbody Component
in the Manual")

## Declaration

public bool SweepTest([Vector3](Vector3.html) direction, out
[RaycastHit](RaycastHit.html) hitInfo, float maxDistance = Mathf.Infinity,
[QueryTriggerInteraction](QueryTriggerInteraction.html)
queryTriggerInteraction = QueryTriggerInteraction.UseGlobal);

### Parameters

direction | The direction into which to sweep the rigidbody.  
---|---  
hitInfo | If true is returned, `hitInfo` will contain more information about where the collider was hit (Additional resources: [RaycastHit](RaycastHit.html)).  
maxDistance | The length of the sweep.  
queryTriggerInteraction | Specifies whether this query should hit Triggers.  
  
### Returns

**bool** True when the rigidbody sweep intersects any collider, otherwise
false.

### Description

Tests if a rigidbody would collide with anything, if it was moved through the
Scene.

Tests if a rigidbody would collide with anything, if it was moved through the
Scene. This is similar to doing a [Physics.Raycast](Physics.Raycast.html) for
all points contained in any of a Rigidbody's colliders and returning the
closest of all hits (if any) reported. This is useful for AI code, say if you
need to know that an object would fit through a gap without colliding with
anything.  
  
Note that this function only works when a primitive collider type (sphere,
cube or capsule) or a convex mesh is attached to the rigidbody object -
concave mesh colliders will not work, although they can be detected in the
Scene by the sweep.

        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            [RaycastHit](RaycastHit.html) hit;
            if (rb.SweepTest(transform.forward, out hit, collisionCheckDistance))
            {
                aboutToCollide = true;
                distanceToCollision = hit.distance;
            }
        }
    }
