### Description

Representation of four-dimensional vectors.

This structure is used in some places to represent four component vectors
(e.g. mesh tangents, parameters for shaders). In the majority of other cases a
[Vector3](Vector3.html) is used.

### Static Properties

[negativeInfinity](Vector4-negativeInfinity.html)| Shorthand for writing
Vector4(float.NegativeInfinity, float.NegativeInfinity,
float.NegativeInfinity, float.NegativeInfinity).  
---|---  
[one](Vector4-one.html)| Shorthand for writing Vector4(1,1,1,1).  
[positiveInfinity](Vector4-positiveInfinity.html)| Shorthand for writing
Vector4(float.PositiveInfinity, float.PositiveInfinity,
float.PositiveInfinity, float.PositiveInfinity).  
[zero](Vector4-zero.html)| Shorthand for writing Vector4(0,0,0,0).  
  
### Properties

[magnitude](Vector4-magnitude.html)| Returns the length of this vector (Read
Only).  
---|---  
[normalized](Vector4-normalized.html)| Returns a normalized vector based on
the current vector. The normalized vector has a magnitude of 1 and is in the
same direction as the current vector. Returns a zero vector If the current
vector is too small to be normalized.  
[sqrMagnitude](Vector4-sqrMagnitude.html)| Returns the squared length of this
vector (Read Only).  
[this[int]](Vector4.Index_operator.html)| Access the x, y, z, w components
using [0], [1], [2], [3] respectively.  
[w](Vector4-w.html)| W component of the vector.  
[x](Vector4-x.html)| X component of the vector.  
[y](Vector4-y.html)| Y component of the vector.  
[z](Vector4-z.html)| Z component of the vector.  
  
### Constructors

[Vector4](Vector4-ctor.html)| Creates a new vector with given x, y, z, w
components.  
---|---  
  
### Public Methods

[Equals](Vector4.Equals.html)| Returns true if the given vector is exactly
equal to this vector.  
---|---  
[Set](Vector4.Set.html)| Set x, y, z and w components of an existing Vector4.  
[ToString](Vector4.ToString.html)| Returns a formatted string for this vector.  
  
### Static Methods

[Distance](Vector4.Distance.html)| Returns the distance between a and b.  
---|---  
[Dot](Vector4.Dot.html)| Dot Product of two vectors.  
[Lerp](Vector4.Lerp.html)| Linearly interpolates between two vectors.  
[LerpUnclamped](Vector4.LerpUnclamped.html)| Linearly interpolates between two
vectors.  
[Max](Vector4.Max.html)| Returns a vector that is made from the largest
components of two vectors.  
[Min](Vector4.Min.html)| Returns a vector that is made from the smallest
components of two vectors.  
[MoveTowards](Vector4.MoveTowards.html)| Moves a point current towards target.  
[Normalize](Vector4.Normalize.html)| Makes this vector have a magnitude of 1.  
[Project](Vector4.Project.html)| Projects a vector onto another vector.  
[Scale](Vector4.Scale.html)| Multiplies two vectors component-wise.  
  
### Operators

[operator -](Vector4-operator_subtract.html)| Subtracts one vector from
another.  
---|---  
[operator *](Vector4-operator_multiply.html)| Multiplies a vector by a number.  
[operator /](Vector4-operator_divide.html)| Divides a vector by a number.  
[operator +](Vector4-operator_add.html)| Adds two vectors.  
[operator ==](Vector4-operator_eq.html)| Returns true if two vectors are
approximately equal.  
[Vector2](Vector4-operator_Vector4.html)| Converts a Vector4 to a Vector2.  
[Vector3](Vector4-operator_Vector4.html)| Converts a Vector4 to a Vector3.  
[Vector4](Vector4-operator_Vector3.html)| Converts a Vector3 to a Vector4.  
[Vector4](Vector4-operator_Vector2.html)| Converts a Vector2 to a Vector4.
