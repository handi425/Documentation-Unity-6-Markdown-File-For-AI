**Obsolete** Use ConvertToPrefabInstance() or
ReplacePrefabAssetOfPrefabInstance() which has settings for better control.

## Declaration

public static [GameObject](GameObject.html)
ConnectGameObjectToPrefab([GameObject](GameObject.html) go,
[GameObject](GameObject.html) sourcePrefab);

### Parameters

go | The disconnected GameObject that you want to reconnect.  
---|---  
sourcePrefab | The source Prefab to connect to the GameObject.  
  
### Description

Connects the source Prefab to the game object.

This method allows you to reconnect a GameObject to its source Prefab, when it
has become disconnected. Prior to 2018.3 it was possible for Prefab instances
to become disconnected from their source Prefab. This method fixes that
connection. From 2018.3 onwards, Prefabs cannot become disconnected, so this
method exists only to correct problems that may exist in projects created in
earlier versions of Unity.
