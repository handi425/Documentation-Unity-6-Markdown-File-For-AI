### Description

Freeze rotation along all axes.

    
    
    //Attach this script to a [GameObject](GameObject.html) with a [Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html). Press the up and down keys to move the [Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html) up and down.
    //Press the space key to freeze all rotations, but notice the positions still change.  
      
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        [Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html) m_Rigidbody;

        float m_Speed;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            m_Rigidbody = GetComponent<[Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html)>();
            //Set up vector for moving the [Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html) in the y axis
            m_YAxis = new [Vector3](Vector3.html)(0, 5, 0);
            m_Speed = 20.0f;
        }  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            //Press space to add constraints on the RigidBody (freeze all rotations)
            if ([Input.GetKeyDown](Input.GetKeyDown.html)([KeyCode.Space](KeyCode.Space.html)))
            {
                //Freeze all rotations

            }  
      
            //Press the A key to rotate the [GameObject](GameObject.html) (if there are no rotation constraints)
            if ([Input.GetKey](Input.GetKey.html)([KeyCode.A](KeyCode.A.html)))
            {
                m_Rigidbody.angularVelocity = [Vector3.right](Vector3-right.html) * m_Speed * [Time.deltaTime](Time-deltaTime.html);
            }
