### Parameters

colors | Array of attachments to be used as the color render targets in this sub pass. These are specificed as indices into the array passed to [BeginRenderPass](Rendering.ScriptableRenderContext.BeginRenderPass.html). The values in the array are copied immediately.  
---|---  
inputs | Array of attachments to be used as input attachments in this sub pass. These are specificed as indices into the array passed to [BeginRenderPass](Rendering.ScriptableRenderContext.BeginRenderPass.html). The values in the array are copied immediately.  
isDepthStencilReadOnly | If true, both depth and stencil attachments are read-only in this sub pass. Some renderers require this in order to be able to use the depth and stencil attachments as inputs.  
isDepthReadOnly | If true, the depth attachment is read-only in this sub pass. Some renderers require this in order to be able to use the depth attachment as input.  
isStencilReadOnly | If true, the stencil attachment is read-only in this sub pass. Some renderers require this in order to be able to use the stencil attachment as input.  
  
### Description

Schedules the beginning of a new sub pass within a render pass. If you call
this in a using-statement, Unity executes EndSubPass automatically when
exiting the using-block. Render passes can never be standalone, they must
always contain at least one sub pass. Only one sub pass can be active at any
time.

This method does the same as
[BeginSubPass](Rendering.ScriptableRenderContext.BeginSubPass.html), but it
will return an _IDisposable_ that can be used in a _using_ -statement, and so
it is not necesssary to manually call
[EndSubPass](Rendering.ScriptableRenderContext.EndSubPass.html).
