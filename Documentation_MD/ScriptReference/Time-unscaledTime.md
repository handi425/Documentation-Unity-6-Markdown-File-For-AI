public static float unscaledTime;

### Description

The timeScale-independent time for this frame (Read Only). This is the time in
seconds since the start of the game.

When called from inside MonoBehaviour's
[FixedUpdate](MonoBehaviour.FixedUpdate.html), it returns
[Time.fixedUnscaledTime](Time-fixedUnscaledTime.html).  
  
Unlike [Time.realtimeSinceStartup](Time-realtimeSinceStartup.html), this
returns the same value if called multiple times in a single frame and when the
Editor is paused. Unlike [Time.time](Time-time.html) this value is not
affected by [Time.timeScale](Time-timeScale.html) and
[Time.maximumDeltaTime](Time-maximumDeltaTime.html).  
  
See [Time and Frame Rate Management](../Manual/managing-time-and-frame-
rate.html) in the User Manual for more information about how this property
relates to the other Time properties.
