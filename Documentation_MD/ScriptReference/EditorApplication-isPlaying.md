public static bool isPlaying;

### Description

Whether the Editor is in Play mode.

Returns true if the Editor is in Play mode. Setting
[isPlaying](EditorApplication-isPlaying.html) delays the result until after
all script code has completed for this frame. This also returns true if the
Editor is paused.

isPlayingOrWillChangePlaymode.html).

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);  
      
    // The following is a simple example where [EditorApplication.isPlaying](EditorApplication-isPlaying.html) is watched to
    // report whether the [Editor](Editor.html) is in Play mode.  
      
    public class EditorPlaying : [EditorWindow](EditorWindow.html)
    {
        [[MenuItem](MenuItem.html)("Examples/[EditorApplication.isPlaying](EditorApplication-isPlaying.html) demo")]
        static void Init()
        {
