## Declaration

public bool SendHapticBuffer(uint channel, byte[] buffer);

### Parameters

channel | The channel to receive the data.  
---|---  
buffer | A raw byte buffer that contains the haptic data to send to the device.  
  
### Returns

**bool** Returns true if successful. Returns false otherwise.

### Description

Sends a raw buffer of haptic data to the device.

The buffered data plays at the sampleRate rate, represented by the frequencyHz
value returned by a call to the TryGetCapabilities method, until it completes.  
  
**Note:** Not all devices support playing haptic buffers. To determine whether
buffered haptics are supported, call the
[InputDevice.TryGetHapticCapabilities](XR.InputDevice.TryGetHapticCapabilities.html)
method and inspect the
[HapticCapabilities.supportsBuffer](XR.HapticCapabilities-supportsBuffer.html)
property. Also, the size of the buffer sent to the
[InputDevice](XR.InputDevice.html) must never be greater than
[HapticCapabilities.bufferMaxSize](XR.HapticCapabilities-bufferMaxSize.html).
