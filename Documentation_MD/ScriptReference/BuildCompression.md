### Description

Contains information about compression methods, compression levels and block
sizes that are supported by Asset Bundle compression at build time and
recompression at runtime.

The formats that are currently supported are exposed with static properties.
There are three supported BuildCompression types for compressing AssetBundles
during builds (LZ4, LZMA and Uncompressed) and two supported recompression
methods for runtime (LZ4Runtime and UncompressedRuntime).
