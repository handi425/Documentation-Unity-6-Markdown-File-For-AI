## Declaration

public static [Rect](Rect.html) GetControlRect(bool hasLabel, float height,
[GUIStyle](GUIStyle.html) style, params GUILayoutOption[] options);

### Parameters

hasLabel | Optional boolean to specify if the control has a label. Default is true.  
---|---  
height | The height in pixels of the control. Default is [EditorGUIUtility.singleLineHeight](EditorGUIUtility-singleLineHeight.html).  
style | Optional [GUIStyle](GUIStyle.html) to use for the control.  
options | An optional list of layout options that specify extra layout properties. Any values passed in here will override settings defined by the `style`. Additional resources: [GUILayout.Width](GUILayout.Width.html), [GUILayout.Height](GUILayout.Height.html), [GUILayout.MinWidth](GUILayout.MinWidth.html), [GUILayout.MaxWidth](GUILayout.MaxWidth.html), [GUILayout.MinHeight](GUILayout.MinHeight.html), [GUILayout.MaxHeight](GUILayout.MaxHeight.html), [GUILayout.ExpandWidth](GUILayout.ExpandWidth.html), [GUILayout.ExpandHeight](GUILayout.ExpandHeight.html).  
  
### Description

Get a rect for an Editor control.

When creating a new Editor control it is a sound design to implement the
actual control without relying on GUILayout and instead have the control take
a [Rect](Rect.html) as parameter, similar to the controls in the
[EditorGUI](EditorGUI.html) class. This ensures the control can also be used
in for example a [PropertyDrawer](PropertyDrawer.html), which does not allow
GUILayout.  
  
Once a non-layout version of the control is implemented, a layout version can
easily be made as well, which simply calls into the non-layout version. In
order to get a rect fitting for the control, the GetControlRect function can
be used.
