public float minRegionArea;

### Description

The approximate minimum area of individual NavMesh regions.

This property allows you to cull away small non-connected NavMesh regions.
NavMesh regions whose surface area is smaller than the specified value, will
be removed.  
  
Note: some regions may not get removed. The NavMesh is built in parallel as a
grid of tiles. If a region straddles a tile boundary, the region is not
removed. The reason for this is that the region pruning happens at a stage in
the build process where surrounding tiles are not available.
