## Declaration

protected [Bounds](Bounds.html)
OnHandleChanged([IMGUI.Controls.PrimitiveBoundsHandle.HandleDirection](IMGUI.Controls.PrimitiveBoundsHandle.HandleDirection.html)
handle, [Bounds](Bounds.html) boundsOnClick, [Bounds](Bounds.html) newBounds);

### Parameters

handle | The handle that was dragged.  
---|---  
boundsOnClick | The raw [Bounds](Bounds.html) for this instance's volume at the time the control handle was clicked.  
newBounds | The raw [Bounds](Bounds.html) for this instance's volume based on the updated handle position.  
  
### Returns

**Bounds** The bounds that should be applied to this instance, with any
necessary modifications applied.

### Description

A callback for when a control handle was dragged in the Scene.

This method ensures that the radius axes scale uniformly and that the
[height](IMGUI.Controls.CapsuleBoundsHandle-height.html) and
[radius](IMGUI.Controls.CapsuleBoundsHandle-radius.html) parameters cannot
fall outside their acceptable ranges relative to one another.  
  
The height control handles cannot be made smaller than the diameter. Enlarging
the diameter handles automatically increases the height if needed. The height
value at the time the control was clicked is preferred until the user releases
the control handle.
