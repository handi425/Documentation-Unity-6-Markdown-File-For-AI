### Description

OnMouseUp is called when the user has released the mouse button.

Note that OnMouseUp is called even if the mouse is not over the same
[Collider](Collider.html) as the mouse has been pressed down on. For button-
like behavior see: [OnMouseUpAsButton](MonoBehaviour.OnMouseUpAsButton.html).

    
    
    // Register when mouse dragging has ended. OnMouseUp is called
    // when the mouse button is released.  
      
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void OnMouseUp()
        {
            // If the user releases the mouse button while over the [GameObject](GameObject.html) with this script attached, output this message
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("Drag ended!");
        }
    }
    

**Note:** This function is not called on objects that belong to Ignore Raycast
layer.  
  
This function is called on Colliders and 2D Colliders marked as trigger when
the following properties are set to true:  
  
\- For 3D physics: [Physics.queriesHitTriggers](Physics-
queriesHitTriggers.html)  
  
\- For 2D physics:
[Physics2D.queriesHitTriggers](Physics2D-queriesHitTriggers.html)  
  
[OnMouseUp](MonoBehaviour.OnMouseUp.html) can be a co-routine. Simply use the
yield statement in the function. This event is sent to all scripts attached to
the [Collider](Collider.html).  
  
Additional resources: [OnMouseDown](MonoBehaviour.OnMouseDown.html),
[OnMouseDrag](MonoBehaviour.OnMouseDrag.html).
