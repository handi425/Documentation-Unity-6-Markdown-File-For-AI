### Description

Disposable helper class for managing [BeginGroup](GUI.BeginGroup.html) /
[EndGroup](GUI.EndGroup.html).

[BeginGroup](GUI.BeginGroup.html) is called at construction, and
[EndGroup](GUI.EndGroup.html) is called when the instance is disposed. When
you begin a group, the coordinate system for GUI controls are set so (0,0) is
the top-left corner of the group. All controls are clipped to the group.
Groups can be nested - if they are, children are clipped to their parents.  
  
This is very useful when moving a bunch of GUI elements around on screen. A
common use case is designing your menus to fit on a specific screen size, then
centering the GUI on larger displays.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void OnGUI()
        {
            // Constrain all drawing to be within a 800x600 pixel area centered on the screen.
            using (var groupScope = new [GUI.GroupScope](GUI.GroupScope.html)(new [Rect](Rect.html)([Screen.width](Screen-width.html) / 2 - 400, [Screen.height](Screen-height.html) / 2 - 300, 800, 600)))
            {
                // Draw a box in the new coordinate space defined by the BeginGroup.
                // Notice how (0,0) has now been moved on-screen.
                [GUI.Box](GUI.Box.html)(new [Rect](Rect.html)(0, 0, 800, 600), "This box is now centered! - here you would put your main menu");
            }
            // The group is now ended.
        }
    }
