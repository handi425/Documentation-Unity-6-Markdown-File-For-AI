**Obsolete** Use UnityWebRequest, a fully featured replacement which is more
efficient and has additional features.

## Declaration

public WWW(string url);

### Parameters

url | The url to download. Must be '%' escaped.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**void** A new WWW object. When it has been downloaded, the results can be
fetched from the returned object.

### Description

Creates a WWW request with the given URL.

This function creates and sends a GET request. The stream will automatically
start downloading the response.  
  
After the stream is created you have to wait for it to complete, then you can
access the downloaded data. As a convenience the stream can be yielded, so you
can very easily tell Unity to wait for the download to complete.  
  
**_Note:_** URL must be '%' escaped.

    
    
    // Get the latest webcam shot from outside "Friday's" in Times Square

            {
                // Wait for download to complete
                yield return www;
