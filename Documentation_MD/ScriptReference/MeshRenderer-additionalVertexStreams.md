[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-MeshRenderer.html "Go to MeshRenderer
Component in the Manual")

public [Mesh](Mesh.html) additionalVertexStreams;

### Description

Vertex attributes in this mesh will override or add attributes of the primary
mesh in the MeshRenderer.

This can be used for vertex painting tools, etc. This data is serialized.  
  
For example, if the primary mesh doesn't contain the [Mesh.colors](Mesh-
colors.html) channel, the colors from additionalVertexStreams are used. If the
primary mesh contains the colors channel and the additionalVertexStreams mesh
also has colors, then colors from additionalVertexStreams are used.  
  
`MeshRenderer.additionalVertexStreams` isn't supported if you use either of
the following:

  * [Dynamic batching](../Manual/dynamic-batching.html)
  * [GPU instancing](../Manual/GPUInstancing.html)
