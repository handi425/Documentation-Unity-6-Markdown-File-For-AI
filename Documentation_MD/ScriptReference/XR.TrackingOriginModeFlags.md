### Description

This enum provides context to where the 0,0,0 point of tracking for
[InputDevice](XR.InputDevice.html)s is.

Each [XRInputSubsystem](XR.XRInputSubsystem.html) has a single origin for all
reported [InputDevice](XR.InputDevice.html)s. The origin can be relative to
either real-world objects, such as a physical tracking device, or virtual
objects, such as the center of a user-drawn bounding region.

### Properties

[Unknown](XR.TrackingOriginModeFlags.Unknown.html)|
TrackingOriginModeFlags.Unknown enumerates when the XRInputSubsystem was not
able to set its tracking origin or has no tracking.  
---|---  
[Device](XR.TrackingOriginModeFlags.Device.html)|  XRInputSubsystem tracks all
InputDevices in reference to the first known location of a specific
InputDevice when set to TrackingOriginModeFlags.Device.  
[Floor](XR.TrackingOriginModeFlags.Floor.html)|  XRInputSubsystem tracks all
InputDevices in reference to a point on the floor when set to
TrackingOriginModeFlags.Floor.  
[TrackingReference](XR.TrackingOriginModeFlags.TrackingReference.html)|
XRInputSubsystem tracks all InputDevices in reference to an InputDevice with
the InputDeviceCharacteristics.TrackingReference flag set when set to
TrackingOriginModeFlags.TrackingReference.  
[Unbounded](XR.TrackingOriginModeFlags.Unbounded.html)|  XRInputSubsystem
tracks all InputDevices in relation to a world anchor. This world anchor can
change at any time, and is chosen by the runtime.
