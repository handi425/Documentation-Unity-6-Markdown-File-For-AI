public [UIElements.IStyle](UIElements.IStyle.html) style;

### Description

Sets the style values on a [VisualElement](UIElements.VisualElement.html).

The returned style data, computed from USS files or inline styles written to
this object in C#, doesn't represent the fully resolved styles, such as the
final height and width of a VisualElement. To access these fully resolved
styles, use resolvedStyle.  
  
For information about how to use this property and all the supported USS
properties, refer to the [Apply styles in C# scripts](../Manual/UIE-apply-
styles-with-csharp.html) and [USS properties reference](../Manual/UIE-USS-
Properties-Reference.html) manual pages.  
  
Additional resources: [VisualElement.resolvedStyle](UIElements.VisualElement-
resolvedStyle.html), [VisualElement.customStyle](UIElements.VisualElement-
customStyle.html), [StyleSheet](UIElements.StyleSheet.html)  
  

    
    
     // Set the background color of the element to red.
     element.style.backgroundColor = [Color.red](Color-red.html);
