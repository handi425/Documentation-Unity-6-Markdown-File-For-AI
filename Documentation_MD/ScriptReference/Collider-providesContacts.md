public bool providesContacts;

### Description

Whether or not this Collider generates contacts for
[Physics.ContactEvent](Physics.ContactEvent.html).

If this property is set to `true`, all contacts produced by this collider will
appear in the buffer. If this property is set to false, contact generation
will depend on these factors:

  * If the Collider or its Rigidbody have a script with a [MonoBehaviour.OnCollisionStay](MonoBehaviour.OnCollisionStay.html) method, all contacts will be generated for [Physics.ContactEvent](Physics.ContactEvent.html).
  * If the Collider or its Rigidbody has a script with either [MonoBehaviour.OnCollisionEnter](MonoBehaviour.OnCollisionEnter.html) or [MonoBehaviour.OnCollisionExit](MonoBehaviour.OnCollisionExit.html) but not [MonoBehaviour.OnCollisionStay](MonoBehaviour.OnCollisionStay.html), enter and exit contacts will be generated for [Physics.ContactEvent](Physics.ContactEvent.html), but not stay contacts.
  * If the [PhysicsVisualizationSettings.showAllContacts](PhysicsVisualizationSettings-showAllContacts.html) property is set to true, all Colliders will generate all contacts for visualisation purposes!
