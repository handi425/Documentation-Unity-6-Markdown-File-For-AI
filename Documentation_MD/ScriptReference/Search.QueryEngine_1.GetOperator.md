## Declaration

public [Search.QueryFilterOperator](Search.QueryFilterOperator.html)
GetOperator(string op);

### Parameters

op | The operator identifier.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**QueryFilterOperator** The global
[QueryFilterOperator](Search.QueryFilterOperator.html).

### Description

Get a custom operator added on the [QueryEngine](Search.QueryEngine_1.html).

This method returns a [QueryFilterOperator](Search.QueryFilterOperator.html)
that was added on the [QueryEngine](Search.QueryEngine_1.html). If the
operator does not exist, the
[QueryFilterOperator](Search.QueryFilterOperator.html) will be invalid (see
[QueryFilterOperator.valid](Search.QueryFilterOperator-valid.html)).

    
    
    // Get an operator based on its token and add some handlers on it.
    var operatorToken = "%";
    var operatorObject = queryEngine.GetOperator(operatorToken);
    if (operatorObject.valid)
        operatorObject.AddHandler((float ev, float fv) => Math.Abs(ev % fv) < 0.0000001f);
    

See [AddOperator](Search.QueryEngine_1.AddOperator.html) for a complete
example.
