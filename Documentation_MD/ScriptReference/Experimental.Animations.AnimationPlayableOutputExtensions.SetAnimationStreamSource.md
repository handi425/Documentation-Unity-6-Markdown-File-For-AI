## Declaration

public static void
SetAnimationStreamSource([Animations.AnimationPlayableOutput](Animations.AnimationPlayableOutput.html)
output,
[Experimental.Animations.AnimationStreamSource](Experimental.Animations.AnimationStreamSource.html)
streamSource);

### Parameters

output | The [AnimationPlayableOutput](Animations.AnimationPlayableOutput.html) instance that calls this method.  
---|---  
streamSource | The [AnimationStreamSource](Experimental.Animations.AnimationStreamSource.html) to apply on this output.  
  
### Description

Sets the stream source for the specified
[AnimationPlayableOutput](Animations.AnimationPlayableOutput.html).

When setting the
[AnimationStreamSource](Experimental.Animations.AnimationStreamSource.html) of
the output to
[AnimationStreamSource.DefaultValues](Experimental.Animations.AnimationStreamSource.DefaultValues.html),
the [AnimationStream](Animations.AnimationStream.html) of this output
initalizes every frame with the default values of the
[Animator](Animator.html).  
  
When setting the
[AnimationStreamSource](Experimental.Animations.AnimationStreamSource.html) of
the output to
[AnimationStreamSource.PreviousInputs](Experimental.Animations.AnimationStreamSource.PreviousInputs.html),
the [AnimationStream](Animations.AnimationStream.html) of this output
initalizes every frame with the result of any previously evaluated outputs on
the same [Animator](Animator.html).  
  
If you use the graph connected to an
[AnimationPlayableOutput](Animations.AnimationPlayableOutput.html) to post-
process the result of other Animation graphs connected to the same
[Animator](Animator.html), you should use
[AnimationStreamSource.PreviousInputs](Experimental.Animations.AnimationStreamSource.PreviousInputs.html).
For example, if you use the [AnimationStream](Animations.AnimationStream.html)
to build an Inverse Kinematics constraint to post-process the built-in
[AnimatorController](Animations.AnimatorController.html), your
[AnimationPlayableOutput](Animations.AnimationPlayableOutput.html) should be
set to
[AnimationStreamSource.PreviousInputs](Experimental.Animations.AnimationStreamSource.PreviousInputs.html).  
  
In order to start the [AnimationStream](Animations.AnimationStream.html) from
a blank slate, you should use
[AnimationStreamSource.DefaultValues](Experimental.Animations.AnimationStreamSource.DefaultValues.html).
For example, to build a custom animation source starting from the default
pose, the [AnimationPlayableOutput](Animations.AnimationPlayableOutput.html)
should be set to
[AnimationStreamSource.DefaultValues](Experimental.Animations.AnimationStreamSource.DefaultValues.html).
