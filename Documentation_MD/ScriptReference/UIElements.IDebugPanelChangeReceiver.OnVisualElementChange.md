## Declaration

public void
OnVisualElementChange([UIElements.VisualElement](UIElements.VisualElement.html)
element, [UIElements.VersionChangeType](UIElements.VersionChangeType.html)
changeType);

### Parameters

element |  The element that changed.  
---|---  
changeType | A string that contains the comma-separated value of what has changed.  
  
### Description

Receives notifications for every change that occurs on the panel's visual
elements. This method is exclusively available in development builds and the
Editor, as it serves as a debug feature that complements the profiling of an
application.

The number of times the callback is called, the value returned, and the order
in which they are returned are subject to change between each minor release of
Unity, as this is considered internal. Related to
[PanelSettings.SetPanelChangeReceiver](UIElements.PanelSettings.SetPanelChangeReceiver.html)
