public static [Rendering.FilteringSettings](Rendering.FilteringSettings.html)
defaultValue;

### Description

Creates a `FilteringSettings` struct that contains default values for all
properties. With these default values, Unity does not perform any filtering.

To override values at the time that you create the struct, use the
[FilteringSettings constructor](Rendering.FilteringSettings-ctor.html).  
  
This example demonstrates the syntax for creating a default
`FilteringSettings` struct with default values.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.Rendering;  
      
    public class FilteringSettingsExample
    {
        public [FilteringSettings](Rendering.FilteringSettings.html) CreateFilteringSettings()
        {
            // Instantiate a [FilteringSettings](Rendering.FilteringSettings.html) struct with the default value
            // (i.e., perform no filtering)
            [FilteringSettings](Rendering.FilteringSettings.html) defaultFilteringSettings = [FilteringSettings.defaultValue](Rendering.FilteringSettings-defaultValue.html);  
      
            return defaultFilteringSettings;
        }
    }
