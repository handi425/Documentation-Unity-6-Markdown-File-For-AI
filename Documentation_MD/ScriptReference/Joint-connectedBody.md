public [Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html) connectedBody;

### Description

A reference to another rigidbody this joint connects to.

If not set then the joint connects the object to a fixed point in world space.  
  
Unity does not support connecting a joint to a [Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html) in
a different [Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html) that is using a local physics
Scene. If a joint is connected to a [Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html), and then that
[Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html) is moved to a [Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html)
that uses
[LocalPhysicsMode.Physics3D](SceneManagement.LocalPhysicsMode.Physics3D.html),
then the joint is automatically disconnected from the
[Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html).  
  
Additional resources: [Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html) and
[LocalPhysicsMode](SceneManagement.LocalPhysicsMode.html).
