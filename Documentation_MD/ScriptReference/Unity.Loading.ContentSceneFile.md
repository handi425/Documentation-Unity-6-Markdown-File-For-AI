### Description

The handle returned from
[ContentLoadInterface.LoadSceneAsync](Unity.Loading.ContentLoadInterface.LoadSceneAsync.html).
You can use this handle to access the status and results of the load
operation.

### Properties

[IsValid](Unity.Loading.ContentSceneFile.IsValid.html)| Returns true if the
ContentSceneFile handle is valid. A handle becomes invalid after the file is
unloaded.  
---|---  
[Scene](Unity.Loading.ContentSceneFile.Scene.html)| The Scene object being
loaded. This is accessible both before and after the load operation completes.  
[Status](Unity.Loading.ContentSceneFile.Status.html)| The loading status of
the scene.  
  
### Public Methods

[IntegrateAtEndOfFrame](Unity.Loading.ContentSceneFile.IntegrateAtEndOfFrame.html)|
Calling this will cause the scene to integrate at the end of the frame.  
---|---  
[UnloadAtEndOfFrame](Unity.Loading.ContentSceneFile.UnloadAtEndOfFrame.html)|
Will trigger the scene to unload at the end of the frame.  
[WaitForLoadCompletion](Unity.Loading.ContentSceneFile.WaitForLoadCompletion.html)|
Blocks on the main thread until the load operation completes. This function
can be slow and so should be used carefully to avoid frame rate stuttering.
