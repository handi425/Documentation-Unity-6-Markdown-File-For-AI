## Declaration

public static bool HasManagedReferencesWithMissingTypes([Object](Object.html)
assetComponentOrGameObject);

### Parameters

componentOrGameObject | An object which is part of a Prefab asset.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**bool** Returns true if there are missing SerializeReference types directly
within a Prefab asset excluding nested Prefab.

### Description

Determines whether the object Prefab asset contains any MonoBehaviours with
missing SerializeReference types.

This method returns true if the Prefab asset contains missing
SerializeReference types. Applying property modifications to a Prefab asset
removes missing type information from the Prefab Asset. However, editing a
Prefab asset in Prefab Mode preserves missing type information. If you are on
an instance, you can use
[PrefabUtility.GetCorrespondingObjectFromSource](PrefabUtility.GetCorrespondingObjectFromSource.html)
to validate if the Prefab asset has missing types. Additional resources:
[SerializationUtility.HasManagedReferencesWithMissingTypes](SerializationUtility.HasManagedReferencesWithMissingTypes.html),
[SerializeReference](SerializeReference.html)
