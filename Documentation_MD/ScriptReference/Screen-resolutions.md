public static Resolution[] resolutions;

### Description

Returns all full-screen resolutions that the monitor supports (Read Only).

Unity returns the resolutions the monitor supports and sorts them by width and
then by ascending resolution. **Important:** When you use
[FullScreenMode.ExclusiveFullScreen](FullScreenMode.ExclusiveFullScreen.html)
you should use `Screen.resolutions` to determine which resolution to pass to
[Screen.SetResolution](Screen.SetResolution.html) because
`FullScreenMode.ExclusiveFullScreen` only works with supported resolutions. If
you pass a non-supported resolution, it has a severe impact on performance.
All other fullscreen modes support arbitrary resolutions without performance
penalties.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class ExampleScript : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            [Resolution](Resolution.html)[] resolutions = [Screen.resolutions](Screen-resolutions.html);  
      
            // Print the resolutions
            foreach (var res in resolutions)
            {
                [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)(res.width + "x" + res.height + " : " + res.refreshRateRatio);
            }
        }
    }
    

**Note:** On MacOS devices that have a notch area, the resolution array
contains resolutions that don't fit under the notch area and will be resized
when applied.

[SetResolution](Screen.SetResolution.html).
