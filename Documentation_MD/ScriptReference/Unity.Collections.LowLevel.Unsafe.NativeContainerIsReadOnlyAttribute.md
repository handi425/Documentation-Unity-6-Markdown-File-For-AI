### Description

Marks a native container type as read only.

Use this attribute when defining a read-only interface to the data stored in a
native container.  
  
Providing a read-only interface to a native collection can help to use your
container efficiently because it removes any ambiguity about whether the code
is reading or writing the data when scheduling a job.  
  
Native container types marked with this attribute must only allow read access.
Applying this attribute doesn't prevent code that uses the native container
type from attempting to write to the native container.  
  
For information on creating your own native container, refer to the User
Manual documentation on [Implement a custom native container](../Manual/job-
system-custom-nativecontainer.html).
