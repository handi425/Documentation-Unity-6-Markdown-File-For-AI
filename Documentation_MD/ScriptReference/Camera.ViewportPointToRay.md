[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-Camera.html "Go to Camera Component in the
Manual")

## Declaration

public [Ray](Ray.html) ViewportPointToRay([Vector3](Vector3.html) pos);

## Declaration

public [Ray](Ray.html) ViewportPointToRay([Vector3](Vector3.html) pos,
[Camera.MonoOrStereoscopicEye](Camera.MonoOrStereoscopicEye.html) eye);

### Parameters

eye | Optional argument that can be used to specify which eye transform to use. Default is Mono.  
---|---  
  
### Description

Returns a ray going from camera through a viewport point.

Resulting ray is in world space, starting on the near plane of the camera and
going through position's (x,y) coordinates on the viewport (position.z is
ignored).  
  
Viewport coordinates are normalized and relative to the camera. The bottom-
left of the camera is (0,0); the top-right is (1,1).

    
    
    // Prints the name of the object camera is directly looking at
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        [Camera](Camera.html) cam;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            cam = GetComponent<[Camera](Camera.html)>();
        }  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            [Ray](Ray.html) ray = cam.ViewportPointToRay(new [Vector3](Vector3.html)(0.5F, 0.5F, 0));
            [RaycastHit](RaycastHit.html) hit;
            if ([Physics.Raycast](Physics.Raycast.html)(ray, out hit))
                print("I'm looking at " + hit.transform.name);
            else
                print("I'm looking at nothing!");
        }
    }
