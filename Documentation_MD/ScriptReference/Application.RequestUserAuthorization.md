## Declaration

public static [AsyncOperation](AsyncOperation.html)
RequestUserAuthorization([UserAuthorization](UserAuthorization.html) mode);

### Description

Request authorization to use the webcam or microphone on iOS, and the webcam
only on WebGL.

`Application.RequestUserAuthorization` is called to request permission for
microphone and camera. The application shows a dialog box to the user and
waits for the operation to complete before being able to use these features.  
  
**Note:** Use
[Application.HasUserAuthorization](Application.HasUserAuthorization.html) to
query the result of the operation.
