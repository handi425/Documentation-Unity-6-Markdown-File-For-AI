### Description

Struct that holds information regarding an output of a PlayableAsset.

PlayableAssets specify the type of outputs it supports using PlayableBindings.  
  
Do not create PlayableBinding objects directly. Use the provided built-in
methods to create the corresponding
[PlayableOutput](Playables.PlayableOutput.html). For example, to create a
PlayableBinding for an
[AnimationPlayableOutput](Animations.AnimationPlayableOutput.html), use
[AnimationPlayableBinding.Create](Animations.AnimationPlayableBinding.Create.html).
To create a PlayableBinding for a
[ScriptPlayableOutput](Playables.ScriptPlayableOutput.html), use
[ScriptPlayableBinding.Create](Playables.ScriptPlayableBinding.Create.html).

### Static Properties

[DefaultDuration](Playables.PlayableBinding.DefaultDuration.html)| The default
duration used when a PlayableOutput has no fixed duration.  
---|---  
[None](Playables.PlayableBinding.None.html)| A constant to represent a
PlayableAsset has no bindings.  
  
### Properties

[outputTargetType](Playables.PlayableBinding-outputTargetType.html)| The type
of target required by the PlayableOutput for this PlayableBinding.  
---|---  
[sourceObject](Playables.PlayableBinding-sourceObject.html)| A reference to a
UnityEngine.Object that acts a key for this binding.  
[streamName](Playables.PlayableBinding-streamName.html)| The name of the
output or input stream.
