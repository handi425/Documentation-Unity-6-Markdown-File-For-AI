### Description

Script compilation options.

Note: this enum and its values exist to provide low-level support for the
**Scriptable Build Pipeline** package. This is intended for internal use only;
use the [Scriptable Build Pipeline
package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.scriptablebuildpipeline@latest/index.html)
to implement a fully featured build pipeline. You can install this via the
[Unity Package Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.package-
manager-ui@latest/index.html).

### Properties

[None](Build.Player.ScriptCompilationOptions.None.html)| Compiled the scripts
without any special settings.  
---|---  
[DevelopmentBuild](Build.Player.ScriptCompilationOptions.DevelopmentBuild.html)|
Build a development version of the scripts.  
[Assertions](Build.Player.ScriptCompilationOptions.Assertions.html)| Include
assertions in the compiled scripts. By default, the assertions are only
included in development builds.
