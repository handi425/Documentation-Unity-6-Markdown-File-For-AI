### Description

Describes a render target with one or more color buffers, a depth/stencil
buffer and the associated load/store-actions that are applied when the render
target is active.

This data structure is similiar to
[RenderTargetSetup](RenderTargetSetup.html), but relies on a
[RenderTargetIdentifier](Rendering.RenderTargetIdentifier.html) to ensure
compatability with
[CommandBuffer.SetRenderTarget](Rendering.CommandBuffer.SetRenderTarget.html).  
  
To render to a specific mipmap level, cubemap face or depth slice the
[RenderTargetIdentifier](Rendering.RenderTargetIdentifier.html) should be
created accordingly.  
  
Note: the number of load- and store-actions specified for color buffers must
be equal to the number of color buffers.  
  
Additional resources: [CommandBuffer](Rendering.CommandBuffer.html).
