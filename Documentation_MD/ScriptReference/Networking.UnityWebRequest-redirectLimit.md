public int redirectLimit;

### Description

Indicates the number of redirects that this
[UnityWebRequest](Networking.UnityWebRequest.html) follows before halting with
a `Redirect Limit Exceeded` system error.

If you want to disable redirects altogether, set this property to zero - this
`UnityWebRequest` will then refuse to follow redirects. If a redirect is
encountered while redirects are disabled, the request will halt with a
`Redirect Limit Exceeded` system error.  
  
If you don't want to limit the number of redirects, you can set this property
to any negative number. **Note:** **This is not recommended**. If the redirect
limit is disabled and the `UnityWebRequest` encounters a redirect loop, the
`UnityWebRequest` will consume processor time until
[Abort](Networking.UnityWebRequest.Abort.html) is called.  
  
**Note:** On WebGL platforms, the `UnityWebRequest` API behaves differently.
It only supports a redirect limit of `0` where the request fails on a
redirect, and for anything above `0`, it uses the browser-default redirect
limit. This applies to Unity 2021.3 and later versions.  
  
  
  
_Default value:_ `32`.
