## Declaration

public static void SetMeshCompression([Mesh](Mesh.html) mesh,
[ModelImporterMeshCompression](ModelImporterMeshCompression.html)
compression);

### Parameters

mesh | The mesh to set the compression mode for.  
---|---  
compression | The compression mode to set.  
  
### Description

Change the mesh compression setting for a mesh.

This allows you to enable mesh compression for meshes created from scripting,
which have not been generated by the ModelImporter. That way you can generate
compressed mesh assets from code.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);  
      
    public class ExampleMesh : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            [Mesh](Mesh.html) m = new [Mesh](Mesh.html)();  
      
            //Add mesh data here
            //m.vertices = your vertices;
            //m.triangles = your triangles;  
      
            [MeshUtility.SetMeshCompression](MeshUtility.SetMeshCompression.html)(m, [ModelImporterMeshCompression.High](ModelImporterMeshCompression.High.html));
            [AssetDatabase.CreateAsset](AssetDatabase.CreateAsset.html)(m, "Assets/CompressedMesh.asset");
            [AssetDatabase.SaveAssets](AssetDatabase.SaveAssets.html)();
        }
    }
