## Declaration

public Bounds([Vector3](Vector3.html) center, [Vector3](Vector3.html) size);

### Parameters

center | The location of the origin of the Bounds.  
---|---  
size | The dimensions of the Bounds.  
  
### Description

Creates a new Bounds.

Create a new Bounds with the given center and total size. Bound extents will
be half the given size.

    
    
    // Create bounding box centered at the origin
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        [Bounds](Bounds.html) b;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            b = new [Bounds](Bounds.html)(new [Vector3](Vector3.html)(0, 0, 0), new [Vector3](Vector3.html)(1, 2, 1));
        }
    }
    

When no parameters are given to the constructor, the bounds created has a
center of (0,0,0) and an extent of (0,0,0).
