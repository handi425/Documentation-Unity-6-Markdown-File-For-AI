## Declaration

public void OnRenderBrushPreview([Terrain](Terrain.html) terrain,
[TerrainTools.IOnSceneGUI](TerrainTools.IOnSceneGUI.html) editContext);

### Parameters

terrain | Active Terrain object.  
---|---  
editContext | Interface for communication between Editor and Paint tools.  
  
### Description

Use this method to implement custom tool preview and UI behavior that will
only render while the mouse is within the [SceneView](SceneView.html) bounds
or while you're actively using this tool.

Unity calls this method when the mouse is within the
[SceneView](SceneView.html) viewport bounds, and the
EditorGUIUtility.hotControl is set to 0 or to the [Terrain](Terrain.html)
control ID provided by the [IOnSceneGUI](TerrainTools.IOnSceneGUI.html)
context instance. This is usually when no other tools are active, or when
you're actively using this tool.
