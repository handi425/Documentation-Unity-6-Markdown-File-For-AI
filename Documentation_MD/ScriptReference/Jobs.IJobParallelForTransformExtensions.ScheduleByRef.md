## Declaration

public static [Unity.Jobs.JobHandle](Unity.Jobs.JobHandle.html)
ScheduleByRef(ref T jobData,
[Jobs.TransformAccessArray](Jobs.TransformAccessArray.html) transforms,
[Unity.Jobs.JobHandle](Unity.Jobs.JobHandle.html) dependsOn);

### Parameters

jobData | The job to schedule.  
---|---  
transforms | The [TransformAccessArray](Jobs.TransformAccessArray.html) to run the job on.  
dependsOn | A JobHandle containing any jobs that must finish executing before this job begins. You can combine multiple jobs with [JobHandle.CombineDependencies](Unity.Jobs.JobHandle.CombineDependencies.html). Use dependencies to ensure that two jobs that read or write to the same data don't run in parallel.  
  
### Returns

**JobHandle** The handle identifying the scheduled job, which you can as a
dependency for a later job or to ensure completion on the main thread.

### Description

Schedules an [IJobParallelForTransform](Jobs.IJobParallelForTransform.html)
job with read-write access to the transform data by reference.

This method parallelizes access to transforms in different hierarchies.
Transforms with a shared root object are always processed on the same thread.
All transforms are guaranteed to be valid when this scheduling mode is used.
Invalid transform references in the input array are ignored.
