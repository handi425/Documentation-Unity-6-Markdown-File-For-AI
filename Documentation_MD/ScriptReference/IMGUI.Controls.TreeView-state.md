public [IMGUI.Controls.TreeViewState](IMGUI.Controls.TreeViewState.html)
state;

### Description

The state of the TreeView (expanded state, selection, scroll etc.)

The TreeViewState contains state information that the user could have changed,
for example the selection state, expanded state, and scroll state. The
TreeViewState is the only state that should be serialized/deserialized in the
TreeView. This object is passed in when creating the TreeView and it is up to
the client of the TreeView to decide how it should be persisted. For Editor
windows it will usually be a serialized field in the window. The TreeView
changes the state in this object when the user interacts with the TreeView.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
**Known Issue**. Please check with the Issue Tracker at
