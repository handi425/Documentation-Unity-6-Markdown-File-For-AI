public int xMin;

### Description

The minimal x point of the box.

Only points with an x component greater than or equal to this value are
contained in the box.

Sets the minimum value of [BoundsInt](BoundsInt.html)'s x point. If you enter
a minimum value that is greater than the current maximum value, then the
entered value becomes the new maximum value and the previous maximum value
becomes the new minimum value. The position and size of the
[BoundsInt](BoundsInt.html) is then adjusted based on the new minimum and
maximum values.
