## Declaration

public int
GetVertexAttributeDimension([Rendering.VertexAttribute](Rendering.VertexAttribute.html)
attr);

### Parameters

attr | Vertex data attribute to check for.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**int** Dimensionality of the data attribute, or zero if it is not present.

### Description

Get dimension of a specific vertex data attribute on this Mesh.

Meshes usually use a known format for data layout, for example, a position is
always a 3-component Vector, and a tangent is always a 4-component Vector.
But, in some cases (usually regarding texture coordinates), the data layout
can be of different dimensionality. For example, [SetUVs](Mesh.SetUVs.html)
accepts either a 2D, 3D or 4D texture coordinates. You can use this function
to query this layout.
