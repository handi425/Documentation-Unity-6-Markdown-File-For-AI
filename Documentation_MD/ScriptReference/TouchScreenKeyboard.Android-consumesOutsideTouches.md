**Obsolete** consumesOutsideTouches is deprecated and will be removed in a
future version where Unity will always process touch input outside of the on-
screen keyboard (consumesOutsideTouches = false). public static bool
consumesOutsideTouches;

### Description

Indicates whether the keyboard consumes screen touches outside the visible
keyboard area.

Deprecated: In future versions Unity will always process touch input outside
of the on-screen keyboard. This is relevant when the on-screen keyboard is
visible. When `true`, Unity ignores touch input outside of the on-screen
keyboard area. When `false`, Unity processes touch input outside of the on-
screen keyboard area as it would do if the keyboard wasn't on-screen.  
  
The default value is `false`.
