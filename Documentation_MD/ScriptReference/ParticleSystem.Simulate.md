## Declaration

public void Simulate(float t, bool withChildren = true, bool restart = true,
bool fixedTimeStep = true);

### Parameters

t | Time period in seconds to advance the ParticleSystem simulation by. If `restart` is true, the ParticleSystem will be reset to 0 time, and then advanced by this value. If `restart` is false, the ParticleSystem simulation will be advanced in time from its current state by this value.  
---|---  
withChildren | Fast-forward all child Particle Systems as well.  
restart | Restart and start from the beginning.  
fixedTimeStep | Only update the system at fixed intervals, based on the value in "Fixed Time" in the Time options.  
  
### Description

Fast-forwards the Particle System by simulating particles over the given
period of time, then pauses it.
