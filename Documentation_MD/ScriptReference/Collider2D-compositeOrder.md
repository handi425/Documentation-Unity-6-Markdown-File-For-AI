public int compositeOrder;

### Description

The composite operation order to be used when a
[CompositeCollider2D](CompositeCollider2D.html) is used.

When this [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) is using any composite operation other
than
[Collider2D.CompositeOperation.None](Collider2D.CompositeOperation.None.html),
the composite operation uses the previous composite operation results on the
[CompositeCollider2D](CompositeCollider2D.html) as the input and applies this
[Collider2D](Collider2D.html) geometry using its selected
[Collider2D.compositeOperation](Collider2D-compositeOperation.html).  
  
The composite order is a simple integer value that is first sorted into
ascending order by the [CompositeCollider2D](CompositeCollider2D.html) before
it applies the composite operations with the lowest value being executed first
in order up to the highest values. When the composite order values are
identical, the order is undefined. When using only
[Collider2D.CompositeOperation.Merge](Collider2D.CompositeOperation.Merge.html)
operations, this order is irrelevant to the final result.  
  
Using this order, it is possible to control which previous
[Collider2D](Collider2D.html) that are also using the
[CompositeCollider2D](CompositeCollider2D.html) are affected by this composite
operation.  
  
**NOTE:** After sorting the composite order for all
[Collider2D](Collider2D.html), the first composite operation of
[Collider2D.CompositeOperation.Merge](Collider2D.CompositeOperation.Merge.html)
will always used, independent of that
[Collider2D.compositeOperation](Collider2D-compositeOperation.html) property
setting. This is due to the fact that the first operation has no input
geometry for the operation to complete and only the merge (OR) composite
operation results in any geometry!
