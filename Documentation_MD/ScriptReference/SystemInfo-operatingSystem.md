public static string operatingSystem;

### Description

Operating system name with version (Read Only).

Returns detailed information about the operating system of the device,
including the version. For a simple platform detection, properties like
[Application.platform](Application-platform.html) or [deviceType](SystemInfo-
deviceType.html) might be more appropriate.  
  
**Note:** On Microsoft Store Apps, it's not easy to identify if you're running
32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows. However, you can query the CPU
architecture to find this information. If the CPU is 64-bit,
[SystemInfo.operatingSystem](SystemInfo-operatingSystem.html) returns
**Windows <version> 64 bit**, and if the CPU is 32-bit - **Windows
<version>**.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class ExampleClass: [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            // Prints "Windows 11 (10.0.22621) 64bit" on 64 bit Windows 11
            // Prints "Mac OS X 13.4" on Mac OS Ventura
            // Prints "iPhone OS" with [iOS](PlayerSettings.iOS.html) 15.3.1
            // Prints "iPad OS" on iPad with [iOS](PlayerSettings.iOS.html) 16
            // Prints "[Android](TouchScreenKeyboard.Android.html) OS 13 / API-33 (TQ2A.230305.008.C1/9619669)"
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)([SystemInfo.operatingSystem](SystemInfo-operatingSystem.html));
        }
    }
