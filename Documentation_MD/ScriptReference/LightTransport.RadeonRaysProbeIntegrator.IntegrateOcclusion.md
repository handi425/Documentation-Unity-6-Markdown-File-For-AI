## Declaration

public
[LightTransport.IProbeIntegrator.Result](LightTransport.IProbeIntegrator.Result.html)
IntegrateOcclusion([LightTransport.IDeviceContext](LightTransport.IDeviceContext.html)
context, int positionOffset, int positionCount, int sampleCount, int
maxLightsPerProbe, BufferSlice<int> perProbeLightIndices, BufferSlice<float>
probeOcclusionEstimateOut);

### Parameters

context | Device context.  
---|---  
positionOffset | Offset measured from the beginning of the probe position buffer.  
positionCount | Number of probes to integrate.  
sampleCount | Number of samples to take.  
maxLightsPerProbe | Maximum number of lights per probe. The value must be 4.  
perProbeLightIndices | Buffer slice containing the per probe light indices.  
probeOcclusionEstimateOut | Buffer slice to write the probe occlusion estimate into. The size of the buffer in bytes should be maxLightsPerProbe * sizeof(float).  
  
### Returns

**Result** Return code.

### Description

Integrate occlusion.

The integrator does spherical sampling for each probe position. Occlusion is 1
if all rays hit front-facing triangles or the sky. Occlusion is 0 if all rays
hit back-facing triangles.
