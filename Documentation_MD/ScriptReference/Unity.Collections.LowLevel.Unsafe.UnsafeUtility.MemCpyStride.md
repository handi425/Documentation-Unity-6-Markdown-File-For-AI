## Declaration

public static void MemCpyStride(void* destination, int destinationStride,
void* source, int sourceStride, int elementSize, int count);

### Description

Similar to
[UnsafeUtility.MemCpy](Unity.Collections.LowLevel.Unsafe.UnsafeUtility.MemCpy.html)
but can skip bytes via desinationStride and sourceStride.

    
    
    // Functional equivalent to this (But with various optimizations)
    byte* destinationBytes = (byte*)destination;
    byte* sourceBytes = (byte*)source;
    for (int i = 0; i != count; i++)
    {
        [UnsafeUtility.MemCpy](Unity.Collections.LowLevel.Unsafe.UnsafeUtility.MemCpy.html)(destinationBytes, sourceBytes, elementSize);
        destinationBytes += destinationStride;
        sourceBytes += sourceStride;
    }
