public int timeout;

### Description

Sets UnityWebRequest to attempt to abort after the number of seconds in
`timeout` have passed.

When a timeout occurs [error](Networking.UnityWebRequest-error.html) returns
"Request timeout" . No timeout is applied when `timeout` is set to `0` and
this property defaults to `0`.  
**Note:** The set timeout may apply to each URL redirect on Android which can
result in a longer response.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;
    using UnityEngine.Networking;  
      
    // Ask the website to deliver an image that is very large.
    // Set the download to take more than 1 second.  This causes
    // the "request timeout" error message.  
      
    public class ExampleScript : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            StartCoroutine(GetText());
        }  
      
        IEnumerator GetText()
        {
            using [UnityWebRequest](Networking.UnityWebRequest.html) www = [UnityWebRequest.Get](Networking.UnityWebRequest.Get.html)("https://my-website.com/verylargeimage.jpg");  
      
            // wait up to one second to download the image
            www.timeout = 1;
            yield return www.SendWebRequest();  
      
            if (www.result != [UnityWebRequest.Result.Success](Networking.UnityWebRequest.Result.Success.html))
            {
                [Debug.LogError](Debug.LogError.html)(www.error);
            }
            else
            {
                [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("image arrived");
            }
        }
