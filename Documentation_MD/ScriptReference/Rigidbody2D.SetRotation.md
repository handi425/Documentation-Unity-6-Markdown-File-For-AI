## Declaration

public void SetRotation(float angle);

### Parameters

angle | The rotation of the Rigidbody (in degrees).  
---|---  
  
### Description

Sets the rotation of the [Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) to `angle` (given in
degrees).

Additional resources: [Rigidbody2D.rotation](Rigidbody2D-rotation.html) and
[Rigidbody2D.MoveRotation](Rigidbody2D.MoveRotation.html).

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    // [Rotate](UIElements.Rotate.html) rigidBody2D every frame.
    public class ExampleScript : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public [Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) rigidBody2D;
        public float rotation = 0.0f;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            rigidBody2D = GetComponent<[Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html)>();
        }  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            rigidBody2D.SetRotation(rotation);  
      
            rotation += 1.0f;
        }
    }

## Declaration

public void SetRotation([Quaternion](Quaternion.html) rotation);

### Parameters

rotation | Full 3D rotation used to extract only the z-axis rotation.  
---|---  
  
### Description

Sets the rotation of the [Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) to the z-axis
rotation extracted from the full 3D `rotation`.

The z-axis rotation is extracted from the given [Quaternion](Quaternion.html)
`rotation` and used as the rotation for [Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html). It is
important to understand that the full 3D rotation isn't used because the
[Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) only has a single degree of rotational freedom
around the z-axis.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    // [Rotate](UIElements.Rotate.html) rigidBody2D every frame.
    public class ExampleScript : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public [Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) rigidBody2D;
        public float rotation = 0.0f;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            rigidBody2D = GetComponent<[Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html)>();
        }  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            var quaternionRotation = [Quaternion.Euler](Quaternion.Euler.html)(0f, 0f, rotation);
            rigidBody2D.SetRotation(rotation);  
      
            rotation += 1.0f;
        }
    }
