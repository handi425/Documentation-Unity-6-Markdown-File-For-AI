### Description

Support for various [Graphics.CopyTexture](Graphics.CopyTexture.html) cases.

Most modern platforms and graphics APIs support quite flexible texture copy
(e.g. copy from a [RenderTexture](RenderTexture.html) into a
[Cubemap](Cubemap.html) face). However some older systems might not support
certain parts of texture copy functionality. This enum indicates support for
this. Use [SystemInfo.copyTextureSupport](SystemInfo-copyTextureSupport.html)
to check for support before calling
[Graphics.CopyTexture](Graphics.CopyTexture.html).  
  
Direct3D 11, Direct3D 12, and Metal platforms generally support flexible
texture copy (all CopyTextureSupport flags are set).  
  
OpenGL supports flexible texture copy since OpenGL 4.3; OpenGL ES supports
flexible texture copy since OpenGL ES 3.1 with Android Extension Pack; on
earlier versions there's no copy support right now
([CopyTextureSupport.None](Rendering.CopyTextureSupport.None.html)).  
  
Direct3D9 systems have somewhat limited texture copy support (can't copy 3D
textures, and can't copy between textures and render textures).  
  
WebGL currently do not have texture copy support
([CopyTextureSupport.None](Rendering.CopyTextureSupport.None.html)).  
  
Additional resources: [Graphics.CopyTexture](Graphics.CopyTexture.html),
[SystemInfo.copyTextureSupport](SystemInfo-copyTextureSupport.html).
