Component in the Manual")

## Declaration

public void PlayOneShot([AudioClip](AudioClip.html) clip, float volumeScale =
1.0F);

### Parameters

clip | The clip being played.  
---|---  
volumeScale | The scale of the volume. Unity automatically clamps negative scales to zero. Note: Scales larger than one might cause clipping.  
  
### Description

Plays an [AudioClip](AudioClip.html), and scales the
[AudioSource](AudioSource.html) volume by volumeScale.

[AudioSource.PlayOneShot](AudioSource.PlayOneShot.html) does not cancel clips
that are already being played by
[AudioSource.PlayOneShot](AudioSource.PlayOneShot.html) and
[AudioSource.Play](AudioSource.Play.html). For more information on how this
method differs from [AudioSource.Play](AudioSource.Play.html), see
[AudioSource](AudioSource.html).

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    [[RequireComponent](RequireComponent.html)(typeof([AudioSource](AudioSource.html)))]
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public [AudioClip](AudioClip.html) impact;
        [AudioSource](AudioSource.html) audioSource;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            audioSource = GetComponent<[AudioSource](AudioSource.html)>();
        }  
      
        void OnCollisionEnter()
        {
            audioSource.PlayOneShot(impact, 0.7F);
        }
    }
