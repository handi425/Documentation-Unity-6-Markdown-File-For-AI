### Description

Represents a link available for pathfinding.

You obtain a valid object when you call
[NavMesh.AddLink](AI.NavMesh.AddLink.html) to create one specific link in the
navigation system. Conversely, you need to pass it into
[NavMesh.RemoveLink](AI.NavMesh.RemoveLink.html) to remove that instance of
the link from the system. Use this object to check or modify the state of the
link instance by calling the following methods:
[NavMesh.IsLinkValid](AI.NavMesh.IsLinkValid.html),
[NavMesh.IsLinkOccupied](AI.NavMesh.IsLinkOccupied.html),
[NavMesh.IsLinkActive](AI.NavMesh.IsLinkActive.html),
[NavMesh.SetLinkActive](AI.NavMesh.SetLinkActive.html),
[NavMesh.GetLinkOwner](AI.NavMesh.GetLinkOwner.html) and
[NavMesh.SetLinkOwner](AI.NavMesh.SetLinkOwner.html).  
  
Empty objects created when you instantiate this struct do not represent any
link that exists in the navigation system. The
[NavMesh.IsLinkValid](AI.NavMesh.IsLinkValid.html) and
[NavMesh.IsLinkActive](AI.NavMesh.IsLinkActive.html) methods return a value of
`false` for objects created in this manner.
