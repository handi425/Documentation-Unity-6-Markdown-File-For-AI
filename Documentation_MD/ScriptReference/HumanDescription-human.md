public HumanBone[] human;

### Description

Mapping between Mecanim bone names and bone names in the rig.

Each item in the array is a HumanBone object that contains a Mecanim avatar
bone name, a bone name in the model (to which the Mecanim bone is mapped) and
a "muscle" that specifies the bone's limits of motion. The bones can be listed
in any order but there are a certain number of bones that Mecanim requires you
to define; use [HumanTrait.RequiredBone](HumanTrait.RequiredBone.html) to get
a list of all required bones.  
  
Additional resources: [HumanBone](HumanBone.html),
[HumanTrait.BoneName](HumanTrait.BoneName.html),
[HumanTrait.RequiredBone](HumanTrait.RequiredBone.html).
