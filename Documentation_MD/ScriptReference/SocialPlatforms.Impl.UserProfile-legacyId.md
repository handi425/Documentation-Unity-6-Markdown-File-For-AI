**Obsolete** legacyId returns playerID from GKPlayer, which became obsolete in
iOS 12.4 . id returns playerID for devices running versions before iOS 12.4,
and the newer teamPlayerID for later versions. Please use IUserProfile.id or
UserProfile.id instead.  
**Upgrade to[id](UserProfile-id.html)** public string legacyId;

### Description

Returns the ID provided in the Apple GameKit by GKPlayer.playerID (deprecated
and marked obsolete in iOS 12.4).

For devices running iOS version 12.4 and later, IUserProfile.id returns
[GKPlayer.teamPlayerID](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gkplayer/3174857-teamplayerid?language=objc).  
  
For devices running iOS version 12.3 and earlier, IUserProfile.id returns
[GKPlayer.playerID](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gkplayer/1521127-playerid?language=objc).  
  
Use IUserProfile.id instead of UserProfile.legacyId. Only use
UserProfile.legacyId if you need to access
[GKPlayer.playerID](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/gkplayer/1521127-playerid?language=objc)
to migrate player data in your existing project.
