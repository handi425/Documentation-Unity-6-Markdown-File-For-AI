### Description

Begin profiling a piece of code with a custom label defined by this instance
of [CustomSampler](Profiling.CustomSampler.html).

This will show up in the Profiler hierarchy.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.Profiling;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        [CustomSampler](Profiling.CustomSampler.html) sampler;
        void Start()
        {
            sampler = [CustomSampler.Create](Profiling.CustomSampler.Create.html)("MyCustomSampler");
        }  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            sampler.Begin();
            // do something that takes a lot of time
            sampler.End();
        }
    }
    

Profiler.BeginSample is conditionally compiled away using
ConditionalAttribute. Thus it will have zero overhead, when it is deployed in
non-Development Build.
