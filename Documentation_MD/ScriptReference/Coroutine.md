### Description

[MonoBehaviour.StartCoroutine](MonoBehaviour.StartCoroutine.html) returns a
Coroutine. Instances of this class are only used to reference these
coroutines, and do not hold any exposed properties or functions.

A coroutine is a function that can suspend its execution (yield) until the
given [YieldInstruction](YieldInstruction.html) finishes.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        IEnumerator WaitAndPrint()
        {
            // suspend execution for 5 seconds
            yield return new [WaitForSeconds](WaitForSeconds.html)(5);
            print("WaitAndPrint " + [Time.time](Time-time.html));
        }  
      
        IEnumerator Start()
        {
            print("Starting " + [Time.time](Time-time.html));  
      
            // Start function WaitAndPrint as a coroutine
            yield return StartCoroutine("WaitAndPrint");
            print("Done " + [Time.time](Time-time.html));
        }
    }
    

This example shows a normal Start:

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    // In this example we show how to invoke a coroutine and execute
    // the function in parallel.  Start does not need IEnumerator.  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        private IEnumerator coroutine;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            // - After 0 seconds, prints "Starting 0.0 seconds"
            // - After 0 seconds, prints "[Coroutine](Coroutine.html) started"
            // - After 2 seconds, prints "[Coroutine](Coroutine.html) ended: 2.0 seconds"
            print("Starting " + [Time.time](Time-time.html) + " seconds");  
      
            // Start function WaitAndPrint as a coroutine.  
      
            coroutine = WaitAndPrint(2.0f);
            StartCoroutine(coroutine);  
      
            print("[Coroutine](Coroutine.html) started");
        }  
      
        private IEnumerator WaitAndPrint(float waitTime)
        {
            yield return new [WaitForSeconds](WaitForSeconds.html)(waitTime);
            print("[Coroutine](Coroutine.html) ended: " + [Time.time](Time-time.html) + " seconds");
        }
    }
