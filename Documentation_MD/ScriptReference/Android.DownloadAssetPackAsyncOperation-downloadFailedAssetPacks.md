public string[] downloadFailedAssetPacks;

### Description

Gets the names of Android asset packs that failed to download.

The Android asset pack names this property returns correspond to asset pack
downloads that either failed due to some error or that the end user canceled.
For more information, call
[AndroidAssetPacks.DownloadAssetPackAsync](Android.AndroidAssetPacks.DownloadAssetPackAsync.html)
and pass a callback method to it. Unity raises the callback with additional
information, such as the error code, during the download. Note: This list also
includes the names of Android asset packs for which Google's PlayCore API did
not raise any callbacks. This happens if you access this property right away
after calling DownloadAssetPackAsync, before the PlayCore API raises any of
the callbacks. Read-only. Additional resources:
DownloadAssetPackAsyncOperation.isDone
[[DownloadAssetPackAsyncOperation.progress.
