maximizing ray tracing performance.  
[PreferFastBuild](Rendering.RayTracingAccelerationStructureBuildFlags.PreferFastBuild.html)|
Build a lower quality acceleration structure, minimizing build time but
decreasing ray tracing performance.  
[MinimizeMemory](Rendering.RayTracingAccelerationStructureBuildFlags.MinimizeMemory.html)|

acceleration structure, and minimize the size of the result.
