[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-MeshFilter.html "Go to MeshFilter Component
in the Manual")

public [Mesh](Mesh.html) mesh;

### Description

Returns either a new [mesh](Mesh.html) or a duplicate of the existing mesh,
and assigns it to the mesh filter.

If no mesh is assigned to the mesh filter a new mesh will be created and
assigned.  
  
If a mesh is assigned to the mesh filter already, then the first query of
`mesh` property will create a duplicate of it, and this copy will be returned.
Further queries of `mesh` property will return this duplicated mesh instance.
Once `mesh` property is queried, link to the original shared mesh is lost and
[MeshFilter.sharedMesh](MeshFilter-sharedMesh.html) property becomes an alias
to `mesh`. If you want to avoid this automatic mesh duplication, use
[MeshFilter.sharedMesh](MeshFilter-sharedMesh.html) instead.  
  
By using `mesh` property you can modify the mesh for a single object only. The
other objects that used the same mesh will not be modified.  
  
It is your responsibility to destroy the automatically instantiated mesh when
the game object is being destroyed.
[Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets](Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets.html) also
destroys the mesh but it is usually only called when loading a new level.  
  
Consider `mesh` property as a shortcut for the following code:

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            [Mesh](Mesh.html) mesh = GetComponent<[MeshFilter](MeshFilter.html)>().sharedMesh;
            [Mesh](Mesh.html) mesh2 = Instantiate(mesh);
            GetComponent<[MeshFilter](MeshFilter.html)>().sharedMesh = mesh2;
        }
    }
    

Which is called on first query of `mesh` property.  
  
**Note:**  
If [MeshFilter](MeshFilter.html) is a part of an asset object, quering `mesh`
property is not allowed and only asset mesh can be assigned.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        // Distorts the mesh vertically.
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            // Get instantiated mesh
            [Mesh](Mesh.html) mesh = GetComponent<[MeshFilter](MeshFilter.html)>().mesh;
            // Randomly change vertices
            [Vector3](Vector3.html)[] vertices = mesh.vertices;
            int p = 0;
            while (p < vertices.Length)
            {
                vertices[p] += new [Vector3](Vector3.html)(0, [Random.Range](Random.Range.html)(-0.3F, 0.3F), 0);
                p++;
            }
            mesh.vertices = vertices;
            mesh.RecalculateNormals();
        }
    }
