public [ModelImporterAvatarSetup](ModelImporterAvatarSetup.html) avatarSetup;

### Description

The Avatar generation of the imported model.

This property depends on the value of
[ModelImporter.animationType](ModelImporter-animationType.html):  
  
\- [ModelImporterAnimationType.None](ModelImporterAnimationType.None.html) or
[ModelImporterAnimationType.Legacy](ModelImporterAnimationType.Legacy.html)
sets this property to
[ModelImporterAvatarSetup.NoAvatar](ModelImporterAvatarSetup.NoAvatar.html)
because Avatar generation does not support the None or Legacy animation types.  
  
\-
[ModelImporterAnimationType.Generic](ModelImporterAnimationType.Generic.html)
supports any value.  
  
\- [ModelImporterAnimationType.Human](ModelImporterAnimationType.Human.html)
requires an avatar to import its animation. You must use either
[ModelImporterAvatarSetup.CreateFromThisModel](ModelImporterAvatarSetup.CreateFromThisModel.html),
[ModelImporterAvatarSetup.CopyFromOther](ModelImporterAvatarSetup.CopyFromOther.html)
or set ModelImporterAvatarSetup.autoGenerateAvatarMappingIfUnspecified to true
.
