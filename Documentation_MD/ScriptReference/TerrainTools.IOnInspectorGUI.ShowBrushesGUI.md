spacing | Pixel spacing for the brush GUI controls.  
---|---  
flags | Specifies which brush controls to display in the Terrain tool UI.  
textureResolutionPerTile | The resolution per Terrain tile of the Texture, which the tool is editing. Unity uses this value to calculate Brush size limits.

textureResolutionPerTile is the largest resolution among them. Additional
