public static bool pipelineSwitchCompleted;

### Description

Indicate when Render Pipeline switch is in progress.

The value is `false` if the render pipeline is in the process of being
switched. The value is `true` if the switch has completed and the render
pipeline is ready for use.  
  
Unity doesn't switch the render pipeline immediately when you set
[GraphicsSettings.currentRenderPipeline](Rendering.GraphicsSettings-
currentRenderPipeline.html) or
[QualitySettings.renderPipeline](QualitySettings-renderPipeline.html). Unity
only initializes a new [RenderPipeline](Rendering.RenderPipeline.html)
instance the first time any [Camera](Camera.html) renders after you set a new
[RenderPipelineAsset](Rendering.RenderPipelineAsset.html). You can use this
property to check if this has happened and the switch has finished.  
  
You can also subscribe to the
[RenderPipelineManager.activeRenderPipelineAssetChanged](Rendering.RenderPipelineManager-
activeRenderPipelineAssetChanged.html) and
[RenderPipelineManager.activeRenderPipelineTypeChanged](Rendering.RenderPipelineManager-
activeRenderPipelineTypeChanged.html) callbacks on the
[RenderPipelineManager](Rendering.RenderPipelineManager.html) if you want to
receive a callback instead of using a property.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
