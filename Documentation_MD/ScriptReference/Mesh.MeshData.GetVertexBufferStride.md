## Declaration

public int GetVertexBufferStride(int stream);

### Parameters

stream | The vertex data stream index to check for.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**int** Vertex data size in bytes in this stream, or zero if the stream is not
present.

### Description

Get the vertex buffer stream stride in bytes.

Meshes usually use a single vertex buffer stream, but it is possible to set up
a vertex layout where attributes use different vertex buffers (see
[SetVertexBufferParams](Mesh.MeshData.SetVertexBufferParams.html)). When you
use such a layout, use this function to query the vertex data size in bytes
within a given stream.
