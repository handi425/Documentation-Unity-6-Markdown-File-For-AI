public static bool lowPowerModeEnabled;

### Description

Indicates whether Low Power Mode is enabled on the device.

While the Low Power Mode is enabled, iOS conserves battery life by enacting
certain energy-saving measures, such as reducing CPU and GPU performance and
reducing screen brightness. While it is active your app can take appropriate
steps to reduce activity or quality settings to maintain an acceptable
performance level.
