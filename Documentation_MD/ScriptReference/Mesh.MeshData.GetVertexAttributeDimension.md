## Declaration

public int
GetVertexAttributeDimension([Rendering.VertexAttribute](Rendering.VertexAttribute.html)
attr);

### Parameters

attr | The vertex attribute to get the dimension of.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**int** Returns the dimension of the vertex attribute. Returns 0 if the vertex
attribute is not present.

### Description

Gets the dimension of a given vertex attribute in the `MeshData`.

Most vertex attributes have a standard data layout. For example, a normal is a
3-component vector. Some vertex attributes (usually texture coordinates) have
more than one possible data layout. For example, [SetUVs](Mesh.SetUVs.html)
accepts either 2 dimensional, 3 dimensional or 4 dimensional texture
coordinates. You can use this function to query the layout of a given vertex
attribute. Additional resources:
[HasVertexAttribute](Mesh.MeshData.HasVertexAttribute.html),
[GetVertexAttributeFormat](Mesh.MeshData.GetVertexAttributeFormat.html).
