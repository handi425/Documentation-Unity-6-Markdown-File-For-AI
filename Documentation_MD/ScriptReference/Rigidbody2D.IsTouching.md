## Declaration

public bool IsTouching([Collider2D](Collider2D.html) collider);

### Parameters

collider | The collider to check if it is touching any of the collider(s) attached to this rigidbody.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**bool** Whether the `collider` is touching any of the collider(s) attached to
this rigidbody or not.

### Description

Checks whether the `collider` is touching any of the collider(s) attached to
this rigidbody or not.

It is important to understand that checking whether colliders are touching or
not is performed against the last physics system update; that is the state of
touching colliders at that time. If you have just added a new
[Collider2D](Collider2D.html) or have moved a [Collider2D](Collider2D.html)
but a physics update has not yet taken place then the colliders will not be
shown as touching. This function returns the same collision results as the
physics collision or trigger callbacks.

## Declaration

public bool IsTouching([Collider2D](Collider2D.html) collider,
[ContactFilter2D](ContactFilter2D.html) contactFilter);

### Parameters

collider | The collider to check if it is touching any of the collider(s) attached to this rigidbody.  
---|---  
contactFilter | The contact filter used to filter the results differently, such as by layer mask, Z depth, or normal angle.  
  
### Returns

**bool** Whether the `collider` is touching any of the collider(s) attached to
this rigidbody or not.

### Description

Checks whether the `collider` is touching any of the collider(s) attached to
this rigidbody or not with the results filtered by the `ContactFilter2D`.

### Parameters

contactFilter | The contact filter used to filter the results differently, such as by layer mask, Z depth, or normal angle.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**bool** Whether any collider is touching any of the collider(s) attached to
this rigidbody or not.
