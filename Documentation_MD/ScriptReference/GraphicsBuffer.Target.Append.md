### Description

GraphicsBuffer can be used as an append-consume buffer.

Allows a buffer to be treated like a stack in compute shaders. Maps to
`AppendStructuredBuffer<T>` or `ConsumeStructuredBuffer<T>` in HLSL.  
  
When you construct a GraphicsBuffer of this type, the value of `stride` must
match the stride of the corresponding StructuredBuffer struct type in your
HLSL code. It must also be a multiple of 4, and less than 2048.  
  
See Microsoft's HLSL documentation on
[AppendStructuredBuffer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-
us/windows/win32/direct3dhlsl/sm5-object-appendstructuredbuffer) and
[ConsumeStructuredBuffer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-
us/windows/win32/direct3dhlsl/sm5-object-consumestructuredbuffer).  
  
The buffer size value can be copied into another buffer using
[GraphicsBuffer.CopyCount](GraphicsBuffer.CopyCount.html), or explicitly reset
with [GraphicsBuffer.SetCounterValue](GraphicsBuffer.SetCounterValue.html).

[ComputeShader](ComputeShader.html),
