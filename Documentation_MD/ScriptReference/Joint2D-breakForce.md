public float breakForce;

### Description

The force that needs to be applied for this joint to break.

When a joint tries to constrain a [Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) it may need
to apply a force to do so. This is known as the
[reactionForce](Joint2D-reactionForce.html). Each physics update, the
[breakForce](Joint2D-breakForce.html) is compared to the size of the
[reactionForce](Joint2D-reactionForce.html); if it exceeds it then
[Joint2D.OnJointBreak2D](Joint2D.OnJointBreak2D.html) is called with a
reference to the joint that broke. Knowing the joint that broke, you can check
the actual reaction force that broke the joint using
[reactionForce](Joint2D-reactionForce.html) or
[Joint2D.GetReactionForce](Joint2D.GetReactionForce.html).  
  
The break force can be set to [Mathf.Infinity](Mathf.Infinity.html) to make
the joint unbreakable by any amount of reaction force. Alternately, setting
the [breakAction](Joint2D-breakAction.html) to
[JointBreakAction2D.Ignore](JointBreakAction2D.Ignore.html) will make the
joint unbreakable by either [breakForce](Joint2D-breakForce.html) or
[breakTorque](Joint2D-breakTorque.html).  
  
The action taken when a joint exceeds the breakForce is controlled by
[breakAction](Joint2D-breakAction.html).

[Joint2D.GetReactionForce](Joint2D.GetReactionForce.html) &
[Joint2D.OnJointBreak2D](Joint2D.OnJointBreak2D.html).
