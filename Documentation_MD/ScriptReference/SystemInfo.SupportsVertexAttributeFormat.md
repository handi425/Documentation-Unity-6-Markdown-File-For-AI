## Declaration

public static bool
SupportsVertexAttributeFormat([Rendering.VertexAttributeFormat](Rendering.VertexAttributeFormat.html)
format, int dimension);

### Parameters

format | The [VertexAttributeFormat](Rendering.VertexAttributeFormat.html) format to look up.  
---|---  
dimension | The dimension of vertex data to check for.  
  
### Returns

**bool** True if the format with the given dimension is supported.

### Description

Indicates whether the given combination of a vertex attribute format and
dimension is supported on this device.

Not all [VertexAttributeFormat](Rendering.VertexAttributeFormat.html) and
dimension combinations are supported. The most common restriction is that
format and dimension data size must be a multiple of 4 bytes, so for example
[VertexAttributeFormat.UNorm8](Rendering.VertexAttributeFormat.UNorm8.html)
with dimensions below 4 are not supported. Some platforms or devices might
have more limitations, for example
[VertexAttributeFormat.Float16](Rendering.VertexAttributeFormat.Float16.html)
is not supported by some mobile phones.  
  
Additional resources:
[VertexAttributeFormat](Rendering.VertexAttributeFormat.html),
[VertexAttributeDescriptor](Rendering.VertexAttributeDescriptor.html).
