public [LayerMask](LayerMask.html) layerMask;

### Description

A [LayerMask](LayerMask.html) that will be used when determining what
[Collider2D](Collider2D.html) should be detected.

This [Layer](Experimental.GraphView.GraphView.Layer.html) will only be used
when [Rigidbody2D.SlideMovement.useLayerMask](Rigidbody2D.SlideMovement-
useLayerMask.html) is true in which case, the specified
[LayerMask](LayerMask.html) will be used to determine which
[Collider2D](Collider2D.html) will be detected and any Layer Collision Matrix
configuration will be ignored.  
  
In other words, this [LayerMask](LayerMask.html) can be used to override and
explicitly specify which layers will be used to detect
[Collider2D](Collider2D.html).  
  
Additional resources:
[Rigidbody2D.SlideMovement.useLayerMask](Rigidbody2D.SlideMovement-
useLayerMask.html), [Rigidbody2D.Slide](Rigidbody2D.Slide.html) and
[SlideResults](Rigidbody2D.SlideResults.html).
