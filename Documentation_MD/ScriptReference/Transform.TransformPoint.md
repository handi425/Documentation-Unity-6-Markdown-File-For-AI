in the Manual")

## Declaration

public [Vector3](Vector3.html) TransformPoint([Vector3](Vector3.html)
position);

### Description

Transforms `position` from local space to world space.

Note that the returned position is affected by scale. Use
[Transform.TransformDirection](Transform.TransformDirection.html) if you are
dealing with direction vectors.  
  
You can perform the opposite conversion, from world to local space using
[Transform.InverseTransformPoint](Transform.InverseTransformPoint.html).  
  
If you need to transform many points at once consider using
[Transform.TransformPoints](Transform.TransformPoints.html) instead as it is
much faster than repeatedly calling this function.  
  
Additional resources:
[Transform.TransformPoints](Transform.TransformPoints.html),
[Transform.TransformDirection](Transform.TransformDirection.html),
[Transform.TransformVector](Transform.TransformVector.html).

            // Instantiate an object to the right of the current object
            thePosition = transform.TransformPoint([Vector3.right](Vector3-right.html) * 2);
            Instantiate(someObject, thePosition, someObject.transform.rotation);
