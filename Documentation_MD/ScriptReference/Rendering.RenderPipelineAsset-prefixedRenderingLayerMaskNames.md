**Obsolete** This property is obsolete. Use RenderingLayerMask API and Tags &
Layers project settings instead. #from(23.3). public string[]
prefixedRenderingLayerMaskNames;

### Returns

**string[]** Returns the mask names defined in
[renderingLayerMaskNames](Rendering.RenderPipelineAsset-
renderingLayerMaskNames.html), but with each name prefixed by its index in the
array, a colon, and a space. For example, if the element with an index of 2
has the name "Example Name", its value in this array is "2: Example Name".

### Description

Returns the names of the Rendering Layer Masks for this pipeline, with each
name prefixed by a unique numerical ID.

This property is useful for creating custom Editor UI for a render pipeline.
If the array of Rendering Layer Mask names contains duplicate names, this
property lets you distinguish them by their prefix.
