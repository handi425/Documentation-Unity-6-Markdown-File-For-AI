### Description

Describes the location of blend shape vertex data in a
[GraphicsBuffer](GraphicsBuffer.html).

When you call [Mesh.GetBlendShapeBuffer](Mesh.GetBlendShapeBuffer.html) with
[BlendShapeBufferLayout.PerShape](Rendering.BlendShapeBufferLayout.PerShape.html),
Unity returns a [GraphicsBuffer](GraphicsBuffer.html) that contains blend
shape vertex data, ordered by blend shape.  
  
When you call
[Mesh.GetBlendShapeBufferRange](Mesh.GetBlendShapeBufferRange.html) for a
given blend shape, Unity returns this struct. Use this struct to locate the
data for that blend shape in the `GraphicsBuffer`.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.Rendering;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public [Mesh](Mesh.html) mesh;
        public [ComputeShader](ComputeShader.html) computeShader;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            // Fetch [GraphicsBuffer](GraphicsBuffer.html) with Blend Shape data, ordered per shape, from the mesh
            var perShapeBuffer = mesh.GetBlendShapeBuffer([BlendShapeBufferLayout.PerShape](Rendering.BlendShapeBufferLayout.PerShape.html));  
      
            // Iterate over all Blend Shapes in a mesh
            for (int blendShapeIndex = 0; blendShapeIndex  < mesh.blendShapeCount; ++blendShapeIndex)
            {
                // Fetch which indices in the buffer that is part of this Blend Shape
                var blendShapeRange = mesh.GetBlendShapeBufferRange(blendShapeIndex);  
      
                // Set the start and end indices of the Blend Shape in the compute shader
                computeShader.SetInt("_StartIndex", (int)blendShapeRange.startIndex);
                computeShader.SetInt("_EndIndex", (int)blendShapeRange.endIndex);  
      
                // Dispatch compute shader and access data between start and end index for this Blend Shape
                computeShader.Dispatch(0, 64, 1, 1);
            }  
      
            // Dispose of [GraphicsBuffer](GraphicsBuffer.html) to avoid leak memory
            perShapeBuffer.Dispose();
        }
    }

[startIndex](BlendShapeBufferRange-startIndex.html)| The index of the first
blend shape vertex for the requested blend shape.
