public [TouchPhase](TouchPhase.html) phase;

### Description

Describes the phase of the touch.

The touch `phase` refers to the action the finger has taken on the most recent
frame update. Since a touch is tracked over its "lifetime" by the device, the
start and end of a touch and movements in between can be reported on the
frames they occur. The `phase` property can be used as the basis of a "switch'
statement or as part of a more sophisticated state handling system.
