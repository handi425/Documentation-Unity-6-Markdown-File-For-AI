### Parameters

other | The other [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) involved in this collision.  
---|---  
  
### Description

Sent when another object enters a trigger collider attached to this object (2D
physics only).

Further information about the other collider is reported in the
[Collider2D](Collider2D.html) parameter passed during the call.  
  
Trigger events will be sent to disabled [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)s,
to allow enabling [Behaviour](Behaviour.html)s in response to collisions.  
  
Additional resources: The [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) class and the
[OnTriggerExit2D](Collider2D.OnTriggerExit2D.html) and
[OnTriggerStay2D](Collider2D.OnTriggerStay2D.html) messages.  
  
An [OnTriggerEnter2D](Collider2D.OnTriggerEnter2D.html) example is shown. This
example has two empty [GameObject](GameObject.html)s, called `GameObject1` and
`GameObject2`. These both have script files which makes the example work. The
first script, `Example1`, creates a [Sprite](Sprite.html) and adds a
[BoxCollider2D](BoxCollider2D.html) and a [Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html).
This object falls under gravity and collides with `Example2`. `Example2` has
no visibility. (The rectangle it creates is visible in the Scene window.) Both
[GameObject](GameObject.html)s report the collision.  
  
The script below is Example1.

    
    
    using System.Collections;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    // Create GameObject1 that falls under gravity.  It will pass through
    // Example2 and cause a collision.  GameObject1 is moved back to
    // the start position and it will again start to fall under gravity.  
      
    public class Example1 : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Awake()
        {
            [SpriteRenderer](SpriteRenderer.html) sr;
            sr = gameObject.AddComponent<[SpriteRenderer](SpriteRenderer.html)>() as [SpriteRenderer](SpriteRenderer.html);
            sr.color = new [Color](Color.html)(0.9f, 0.9f, 0.1f, 1.0f);  
      
            [BoxCollider2D](BoxCollider2D.html) bc;
            bc = gameObject.AddComponent<[BoxCollider2D](BoxCollider2D.html)>() as [BoxCollider2D](BoxCollider2D.html);
            bc.size = new [Vector2](Vector2.html)(1.0f, 1.0f);  
      
            [Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) rb;
            rb = gameObject.AddComponent<[Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html)>() as [Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html);
            rb.gravityScale = 1.0f;  
      
            // A square in the [Resources](Resources.html) folder is used.
            gameObject.GetComponent<[SpriteRenderer](SpriteRenderer.html)>().sprite = [Resources.Load](Resources.Load.html)<[Sprite](Sprite.html)>("square");  
      
            // GameObject1 starts 3 units in the Up direction.
            gameObject.transform.position = new [Vector3](Vector3.html)(0.0f, 3.0f, 0.0f);
            gameObject.transform.localScale = new [Vector3](Vector3.html)(0.5f, 0.5f, 1.0f);
        }  
      
        private float timer = 0.0f;
        private bool restart = false;  
      
        void [FixedUpdate](PlayerLoop.FixedUpdate.html)()
        {
            if (restart == true)
            {
                timer = timer + [Time.deltaTime](Time-deltaTime.html);
                if (timer > 0.25f)
                {
                    gameObject.transform.position = new [Vector3](Vector3.html)(0.0f, 3.0f, 0.0f);
                    gameObject.GetComponent<[Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html)>().velocity = new [Vector2](Vector2.html)(0.0f, 0.0f);
                    restart = false;
                }
            }
        }  
      
        // called when this [GameObject](GameObject.html) collides with GameObject2.
        void OnTriggerEnter2D([Collider2D](Collider2D.html) col)
        {
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("GameObject1 collided with " + col.name);
            restart = true;
            timer = 0.0f;
        }
    }
    

This is `Example2` which is the collide script for the second
[GameObject](GameObject.html):

    
    
    using System.Collections;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    // Create a rectangle that the other [GameObject](GameObject.html) will collide with.
    // Note that this [GameObject](GameObject.html) has no visibility.
    // (View in the [Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html) view to see this [GameObject](GameObject.html).)  
      
    public class Example2 : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Awake()
        {
            [BoxCollider2D](BoxCollider2D.html) bc;
            bc = gameObject.AddComponent<[BoxCollider2D](BoxCollider2D.html)>() as [BoxCollider2D](BoxCollider2D.html);
            bc.size = new [Vector2](Vector2.html)(3.0f, 1.0f);
            bc.isTrigger = true;  
      
            gameObject.transform.localScale = new [Vector3](Vector3.html)(3.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f);
            gameObject.transform.position = new [Vector3](Vector3.html)(0.0f, -2.0f, 0.0f);
        }  
      
        void OnTriggerEnter2D([Collider2D](Collider2D.html) col)
        {
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("GameObject2 collided with " + col.name);
        }
    }
