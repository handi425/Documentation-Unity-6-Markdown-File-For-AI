## Declaration

public static [VersionControl.Task](VersionControl.Task.html)
Merge([VersionControl.AssetList](VersionControl.AssetList.html) assets);

### Parameters

assets | The list of conflicting assets to be merged.  
---|---  
  
### Description

Initiates a merge task to handle the merging of conflicting Assets. This
invokes a merge tool, which you can set in the External Tools section of the
Preferences window, on the conflicting Assets. When the merge task finishes,
the [AssetList](VersionControl.AssetList.html) only contains the Assets that
the tool could merge.

To correctly resolve the resulting [AssetList](VersionControl.AssetList.html)
states (and replace the files with the correct, merged version), you must call
a subsequent [Provider.Resolve](VersionControl.Provider.Resolve.html) task
with a [ResolveMethod.UseMerged](VersionControl.ResolveMethod.UseMerged.html)
ResolveMethod.

    
    
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);
    using UnityEditor.VersionControl;
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class EditorScript : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        [[MenuItem](MenuItem.html)("Version Control/Merge")]
        public static void ExampleMerge()
        {
            [AssetList](VersionControl.AssetList.html) assets = new [AssetList](VersionControl.AssetList.html)();
            assets.Add([Provider.GetAssetByPath](VersionControl.Provider.GetAssetByPath.html)("Assets/ExampleAsset.cs"));
            [Task](VersionControl.Task.html) t1 = [Provider.Merge](VersionControl.Provider.Merge.html)(assets);
            t1.Wait();
            [Task](VersionControl.Task.html) t2 = [Provider.Resolve](VersionControl.Provider.Resolve.html)(assets, [ResolveMethod.UseMerged](VersionControl.ResolveMethod.UseMerged.html));
            t2.Wait();
        }
    }
