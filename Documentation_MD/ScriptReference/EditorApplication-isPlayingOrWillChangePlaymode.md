public static bool isPlayingOrWillChangePlaymode;

### Description

Editor application state which is true only when the Editor is currently in or
about to enter Play mode. (Read Only)

The value is `true` when the Editor is either in Play mode or will enter Play
mode after finishing in-progress tasks such as compiling scripts. The value is
`false` when the Editor is not in Play mode or will exit Play mode after
finishing in-progress tasks.  
  
**Note** : Despite its name, `isPlayingOrWillChangePlaymode` is not `true`
every time the Play mode state will change, but specifically when it will
change from Edit mode to Play mode. Subscribe to
[EditorApplication.playModeStateChanged](EditorApplication-
playModeStateChanged.html) to capture different changes in Play mode state,
including exit from Play mode.
