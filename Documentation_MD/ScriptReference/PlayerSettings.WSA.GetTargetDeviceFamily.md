Component in the Manual")

## Declaration

public static bool
GetTargetDeviceFamily([PlayerSettings.WSATargetFamily](PlayerSettings.WSATargetFamily.html)
family);

### Parameters

family |  [Device Family type](PlayerSettings.WSATargetFamily.html) to check.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**bool** Returns true if the project targets the device family. Otherwise,
returns false.

### Description

Checks if your project targets the specified [device
family](PlayerSettings.WSATargetFamily.html).

In the Editor, Unity displays this as a list of checkboxes under **Supported
Device Families** in [UWP Player Settings](../Manual/class-
PlayerSettingsWSA.html). If you do not indicate that your Universal Windows
Platform application supports any device family type, it defaults to the
Windows.Universal family.  
**Important:** Unity writes these settings to the package manifest when it
builds Universal Windows Platform for the first time. Building into an
existing Universal Windows Platform build folder does not update the package
manifest and does not apply any changes.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
