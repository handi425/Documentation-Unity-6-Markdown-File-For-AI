## Declaration

public string[] OnFilterAssemblies([BuildOptions](BuildOptions.html)
buildOptions, string[] assemblies);

### Parameters

buildOptions | The current build options.  
---|---  
assemblies | The list of assemblies that will be included.  
  
### Returns

**string[]** Returns the filtered list of assemblies that are included in the
build.

### Description

Will be called after building script assemblies, but makes it possible to
filter away unwanted scripts to be included.

Each implementation will be called in the order sorted by callbackOrder. The
result of each invocation is piped through on the next call to
OnFilterAssemblies. You are not allowed to add new assemblies.
