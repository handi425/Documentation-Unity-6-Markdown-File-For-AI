## Declaration

public static void DrawProcedural([Material](Material.html) material,
[Bounds](Bounds.html) bounds, [MeshTopology](MeshTopology.html) topology, int
vertexCount, int instanceCount, [Camera](Camera.html) camera,
[MaterialPropertyBlock](MaterialPropertyBlock.html) properties,
[Rendering.ShadowCastingMode](Rendering.ShadowCastingMode.html) castShadows,
bool receiveShadows, int layer);

### Parameters

material |  [Material](Material.html) to use.  
---|---  
bounds | The bounding volume surrounding the instances you intend to draw.  
topology | Topology of the procedural geometry.  
vertexCount | Vertex count to render.  
instanceCount | Instance count to render.  
camera | If `null` (default), the mesh will be drawn in all cameras. Otherwise it will be rendered in the given Camera only.  
properties | Additional material properties to apply onto material just before this mesh will be drawn. See [MaterialPropertyBlock](MaterialPropertyBlock.html).  
castShadows | Determines whether the mesh can cast shadows.  
receiveShadows | Determines whether the mesh can receive shadows.  
layer |  [Layer](../Manual/Layers.html) to use.  
  
### Description

This function is now obsolete. For non-indexed rendering, use
[Graphics.RenderPrimitives](Graphics.RenderPrimitives.html) instead. For
indexed rendering, use
[Graphics.RenderPrimitivesIndexed](Graphics.RenderPrimitivesIndexed.html).
Draws procedural geometry on the GPU.

This function is now obsolete. For non-indexed rendering, use RenderPrimitives
instead. For indexed rendering, use
[Graphics.RenderPrimitivesIndexed](Graphics.RenderPrimitivesIndexed.html).  
  
DrawProcedural does a draw call on the GPU, without any vertex or index
buffers. If the shader requires vertex buffers one of the following occurs
depending on platform: If the vertex buffer is declared but compiler can
optimize it away then the normal DrawProcedural call will occur. If the
compiler is not able to optimize the vertex buffer declaration away then this
will be converted into a normal mesh drawing call with emulated vertexbuffers
injected. The latter option has performance overhead so it is recommended not
to declare vertex inputs in shaders when using DrawProcedural. This is mainly
useful on [Shader Model 4.5](../Manual/SL-ShaderCompileTargets.html) level
hardware where shaders can read arbitrary data from
[ComputeBuffer](ComputeBuffer.html) buffers.  
  
There's also similar functionality in CommandBuffers, see
[CommandBuffer.DrawProcedural](Rendering.CommandBuffer.DrawProcedural.html).  
  
For non-indexed rendering: `public static void DrawProcedural(Material
material, Bounds bounds, MeshTopology topology, int vertexCount, int
instanceCount = 1, Camera camera = null, MaterialPropertyBlock properties =
null, ShadowCastingMode castShadows = ShadowCastingMode.On, bool
receiveShadows = true, int layer = 0)`  
  
For indexed rendering (takes GraphicsBuffer indexBuffer): `public static void
DrawProcedural(Material material, Bounds bounds, MeshTopology topology,
GraphicsBuffer indexBuffer, int indexCount, int instanceCount = 1, Camera
camera = null, MaterialPropertyBlock properties = null, ShadowCastingMode
castShadows = ShadowCastingMode.On, bool receiveShadows = true, int layer =
0)`

### Parameters

material |  [Material](Material.html) to use.  
---|---  
bounds | The bounding volume surrounding the instances you intend to draw.  
topology | Topology of the procedural geometry.  
indexBuffer | Index buffer used to submit vertices to the GPU.  
instanceCount | Instance count to render.  
indexCount | Index count to render.  
camera | If `null` (default), the mesh will be drawn in all cameras. Otherwise it will be rendered in the given Camera only.  
properties | Additional material properties to apply onto material just before this mesh will be drawn. See [MaterialPropertyBlock](MaterialPropertyBlock.html).

### Description

Draws procedural geometry on the GPU, with an index buffer.

Use the [GraphicsBuffer.Target.Index](GraphicsBuffer.Target.Index.html) target
flag to create an index buffer.
