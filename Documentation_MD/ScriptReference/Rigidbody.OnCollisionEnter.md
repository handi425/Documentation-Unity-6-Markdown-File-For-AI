in the Manual")

### Description

OnCollisionEnter is called when this collider/rigidbody has begun touching
another rigidbody/collider.

In contrast to OnTriggerEnter, OnCollisionEnter is passed the
[Collision](Collision.html) class and not a Collider. The
[Collision](Collision.html) class contains information about contact points,
impact velocity etc. If you don't use collisionInfo in the function, leave out
the collisionInfo parameter as this avoids unneccessary calculations. Notes:
Collision events are only sent if one of the colliders also has a non-
kinematic rigidbody attached. Collision events will be sent to disabled
MonoBehaviours, to allow enabling Behaviours in response to collisions.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        [AudioSource](AudioSource.html) audioSource;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            audioSource = GetComponent<[AudioSource](AudioSource.html)>();
        }  
      
        void OnCollisionEnter([Collision](Collision.html) collision)
        {
            // [Debug](Debug.html)-draw all contact points and normals
            foreach ([ContactPoint](ContactPoint.html) contact in collision.contacts)
            {
                [Debug.DrawRay](Debug.DrawRay.html)(contact.point, contact.normal, [Color.white](Color-white.html));
            }  
      
            // Play a sound if the colliding objects had a big impact.
            if (collision.relativeVelocity.magnitude > 2)
                audioSource.Play();
        }
    }
    

Another example:

    
    
    // A grenade
    // instantiates a explosion Prefab when hitting a surface
    // then destroys itself
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public [Transform](Transform.html) explosionPrefab;
        void OnCollisionEnter([Collision](Collision.html) collision)
        {
            [ContactPoint](ContactPoint.html) contact = collision.contacts[0];  
      
            // [Rotate](UIElements.Rotate.html) the object so that the y-axis faces along the normal of the surface
            [Quaternion](Quaternion.html) rot = [Quaternion.FromToRotation](Quaternion.FromToRotation.html)([Vector3.up](Vector3-up.html), contact.normal);
            [Vector3](Vector3.html) pos = contact.point;
            Instantiate(explosionPrefab, pos, rot);
            Destroy(gameObject);
        }
    }
