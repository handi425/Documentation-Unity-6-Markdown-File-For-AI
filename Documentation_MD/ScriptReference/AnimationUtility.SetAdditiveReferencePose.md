## Declaration

public static void
SetAdditiveReferencePose([AnimationClip](AnimationClip.html) clip,
[AnimationClip](AnimationClip.html) referenceClip, float time);

### Parameters

clip | The animation clip to use.  
---|---  
referenceClip | The animation clip containing the reference pose.  
time | The time that when the reference pose occurs in `referenceClip`.  
  
### Description

Sets the additive reference pose from `referenceClip` at `time` for animation
clip `clip`.

By default, an animation clip used in an additive layer uses the pose at time
0 as its reference pose. This is a big limitation as the reference pose need
to be in the played clip.  
This function allow you to change this behaviour and use a reference pose from
any clip.
