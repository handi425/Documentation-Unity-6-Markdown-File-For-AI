### Parameters

assetOrMetaFilePaths | Paths to Assets or their .meta files, relative to the project folder.  
---|---  
outNotEditablePaths | Destination list of non-editable Asset paths.  
statusQueryOptions | Specifies how Unity should query the version control system. The default value is [StatusQueryOptions.UseCachedIfPossible](StatusQueryOptions.UseCachedIfPossible.html).  
  
### Returns

**void** Returns `true` if all files are editable.

### Description

This is called by Unity when inspecting assets to determine if an editor
should be disabled.

Although this is called by Unity's own systems, you can also call it if you
are implementing your own Editor tools such as a custom version control
integration.

    {
        static bool IsOpenForEdit(string[] paths, List<string> outNotEditablePaths, [StatusQueryOptions](StatusQueryOptions.html) statusQueryOptions)
        {
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("IsOpenForEdit:");
            foreach (var path in paths)
                [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)(path);
            return true;
        }
    }

### Parameters

assetOrMetaFilePath | Path to the asset file or its .meta file on disk, relative to project folder.  
---|---  
message | Returns a reason for the asset not being open for edit.  
  
### Returns

**void** True if the asset is considered open for edit by the selected version
control system.

### Description

This is called by Unity when inspecting an asset to determine if an editor
should be disabled.

Although this is called by Unity's own systems, you can also call it if you
are implementing your own Editor tools such as a custom version control
integration. Consider using method overload that accepts an array of file
paths to improve version control system performance.
