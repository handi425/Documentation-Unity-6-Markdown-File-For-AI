### Parameters

inPath | The transform path to the object to animate.  
---|---  
inType | The type of the MonoBehaviour managing the [SerializeReference](SerializeReference.html) instance to animate.  
refID | The reference id of the SerializeReference instance to animate. Additional resources: [ManagedReferenceUtility.GetManagedReferenceIdForObject](Serialization.ManagedReferenceUtility.GetManagedReferenceIdForObject.html)  
inPropertyName | The name of the property to animate on the object.  
  
### Description

Creates a preconfigured binding for a curve that points to a
[SerializeReference](SerializeReference.html) instance field.

Fields on objects referenced with SerializeReference can be animated when the
host object is derived from [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html). The animation
binding to the referenced object will be based on the reference id instead of
the property path, which makes it possible to correctly resolve the animation
even when there are changes in the path leading to the referenced object. For
example, if the object is referenced from within an array, the animation is
retained even if the position of the object within the array changes.
