## Declaration

public static bool Contains([Object](Object.html) obj);

## Declaration

public static bool Contains(int instanceID);

### Description

Is object an asset?

Returns true when an object is an asset (corresponds to a file in the Assets
folder), and false if it is not (for example object in the Scene, or an object
created at runtime).

    
    
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class AssetDatabaseExamples : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        [[MenuItem](MenuItem.html)("[AssetDatabase](AssetDatabase.html)/Contains Example")]
        static void ContainsExample()
        {
            //[Material](Material.html) is created in memory and the [Asset](VersionControl.Asset.html) Database does not know about it
            var material = new [Material](Material.html)([Shader.Find](Shader.Find.html)("Specular"));
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)([AssetDatabase.Contains](AssetDatabase.Contains.html)(material)); //Output will be false
            //[Material](Material.html) is then saved to disk as an asset and therefore [Asset](VersionControl.Asset.html) Database knows that it exists
            [AssetDatabase.CreateAsset](AssetDatabase.CreateAsset.html)(material, "Assets/Materials/MyMaterial.mat");
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)([AssetDatabase.Contains](AssetDatabase.Contains.html)(material)); //Output will be true
        }
    }
