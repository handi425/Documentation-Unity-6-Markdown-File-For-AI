## Declaration

public static void UpdateCachedState();

### Description

Updates the culling system with the ReflectionProbe's current state. This
ensures that Unity correctly culls the ReflectionProbe during rendering if you
implement your own runtime reflection system.

By default, Unity culls ReflectionProbes automatically as part of the built-in
Scriptable Runtime Reflection System. However, if you implement your own
reflection system, you need to call this function in your implementation of
[ScriptableRuntimeReflectionSystem.TickRealtimeProbes](Experimental.Rendering.ScriptableRuntimeReflectionSystem.TickRealtimeProbes.html).
Call this method once per frame and before the rendering starts to ensure
Unity correctly culls ReflectionProbes during rendering.
