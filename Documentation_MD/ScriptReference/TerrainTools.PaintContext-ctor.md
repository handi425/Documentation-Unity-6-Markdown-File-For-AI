## Declaration

public PaintContext([Terrain](Terrain.html) terrain, [RectInt](RectInt.html)
pixelRect, int targetTextureWidth, int targetTextureHeight, bool
sharedBoundaryTexel = true, bool fillOutsideTerrain = true);

### Parameters

terrain | Terrain that defines terrain space for this PaintContext.  
---|---  
pixelRect | Pixel rectangle to edit in the target terrain texture.  
targetTextureWidth | Width of the target terrain texture (per Terrain).  
targetTextureHeight | Height of the target terrain texture (per Terrain).  
sharedBoundaryTexel | Whether to stretch the Textures so that edge texels lie on the Terrain boundary, and are shared with connected Terrains.  
fillOutsideTerrain | Whether to fill empty space outside of the Terrain tiles with data from the nearest tile.  
  
### Description

Creates a new PaintContext, to edit a target texture on a Terrain, in a region
defined by pixelRect.

This constructor finds all Terrain tiles that touch the pixelRect, searching
across adjacent connected Terrain tiles. It also calculates the relevant
regions on each Terrain, as well as the transforms between them.
