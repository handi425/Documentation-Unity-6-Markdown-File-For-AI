in the Manual")

public int childCount;

### Description

The number of children the parent Transform has.

**Note:** The parent is not included in the count.  
**Note:** Inactive GameObjects get included in the count.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        // generate a group of connected GameObjects
        void Awake()
        {
            [GameObject](GameObject.html) go = new [GameObject](GameObject.html)("top");  
      
            [Random.InitState](Random.InitState.html)(System.Environment.TickCount);  
      
            // add 3, 4 or 5 "middle" children that report to "top"
            for (int i = 0; i < [Random.Range](Random.Range.html)(3, 6); i++)
            {
                [GameObject](GameObject.html) go2 = new [GameObject](GameObject.html)("middle" + i.ToString());
                go2.transform.parent = go.transform;  
      
                // add between 1 to 8 "bottom" children that report to the above "middle"
                for (int j = 0; j < [Random.Range](Random.Range.html)(1, 8); j++)
                {
                    [GameObject](GameObject.html) go3 = new [GameObject](GameObject.html)("bottom" + j);
                    go3.transform.parent = go2.transform;
                }
            }
        }  
      
        void Start()
        {
            // how many children does top have?
            [GameObject](GameObject.html) go = [GameObject.Find](GameObject.Find.html)("top");
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)(go.name + " has " + go.transform.childCount + " children");  
      
            // pick a random middle group and pick a member of its children
            go = [GameObject.Find](GameObject.Find.html)("middle" + [Random.Range](Random.Range.html)(0, go.transform.childCount));
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)(go.name + " has " + go.transform.childCount + " children");
        }
    }
