## Declaration

public void SetShapeVertex(int shapeIndex, int vertexIndex,
[Vector2](Vector2.html) vertex);

### Parameters

shapeIndex | The index of the shape stored in the [PhysicsShapeGroup2D](PhysicsShapeGroup2D.html). The shape index is zero-based with the shape group having a quantity of shapes specified by [shapeCount](PhysicsShapeGroup2D-shapeCount.html).  
---|---  
vertexIndex | The index of the shape vertex stored in the [PhysicsShapeGroup2D](PhysicsShapeGroup2D.html). The vertex index is zero-based with the shape having a quantity of vertex specified by [PhysicsShape2D.vertexCount](PhysicsShape2D-vertexCount.html).  
vertex | The value to set the shape vertex to.  
  
### Description

Sets a single vertex of a shape.

**NOTE** : When accessing multiple vertices, it is more efficient to do one of
the following:

  * Get all the shape vertices using [GetShapeVertices](PhysicsShapeGroup2D.GetShapeVertices.html)
  * Get all the shape group vertices using [GetShapeData](PhysicsShapeGroup2D.GetShapeData.html)
  * Create the [PhysicsShapeGroup2D](PhysicsShapeGroup2D.html) with explicit shapes and vertices lists using the shape group [Constructor](PhysicsShapeGroup2D-ctor.html)
