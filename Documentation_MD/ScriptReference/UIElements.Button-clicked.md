### Description

Callback triggered when the button is clicked.

This is a shortcut for modifying [Clickable.clicked](UIElements.Clickable-
clicked.html). It is provided as a convenience. When you add or remove actions
from clicked, it adds or removes them from `Clickable.clicked` automatically.  
  
The following example shows how to use the clicked event to print a message to
the console when the button is clicked.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);
    using UnityEngine.UIElements;  
      
    public class ButtonExample : [EditorWindow](EditorWindow.html)
    {
        [[MenuItem](MenuItem.html)("Window/[Button](UIElements.Button.html) Example")]
        public static void ShowExample()
        {
            GetWindow<ButtonExample>();
        }  
      
         void CreateGUI()
        {
            var button = new [Button](UIElements.Button.html) { text = "Click me" };
            button.clicked += OnClick;  
      
            rootVisualElement.Add(button);
        }  
      
        void OnClick()
        {
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("Clicked!");
        }
    }
