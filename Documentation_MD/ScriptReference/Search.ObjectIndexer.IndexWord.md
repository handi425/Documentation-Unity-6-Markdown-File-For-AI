    [CustomObjectIndexer(typeof([GameObject](GameObject.html)))]
    static void IndexGameObject([CustomObjectIndexerTarget](Search.CustomObjectIndexerTarget.html) target, [ObjectIndexer](Search.ObjectIndexer.html) indexer)
    {
        var go = target.target as [GameObject](GameObject.html);
        if (go == null)
            return;
    
        indexer.AddWord("myawesomeword", 0, target.documentIndex);
    }
