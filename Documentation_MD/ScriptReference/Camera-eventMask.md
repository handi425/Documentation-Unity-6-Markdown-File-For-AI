[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-Camera.html "Go to Camera Component in the
Manual")

public int eventMask;

### Description

Mask to select which layers can trigger events on the camera.

Just as the camera's `cullingMask` determines if the camera is able to see the
[GameObject](GameObject.html), the event mask determines whether the
[GameObject](GameObject.html) is able to receive mouse events. Only objects
visible by the camera and whose `layerMask` overlaps with the camera's
`eventMask` will be able to receive OnMouseXXX events. Setting this mask to
zero will improve performance and is recommended if you don't use OnMouseXXX
events. See [Layers](../Manual/Layers.html) for more information.
