## Declaration

public static bool TryParse(string stringValue, out
[GlobalObjectId](GlobalObjectId.html) id);

### Parameters

stringValue | The string representation of a `GlobalObjectId`.  
  
The following is an example of the string representation:
`GlobalObjectId_V1-2-74c253e3f16be4776bb2d88e01f77c8a-902906726-0`. For more
information on the composition, refer to
[GlobalObjectId](GlobalObjectId.html).  
---|---  
id | The `GlobalObjectId` struct to populate with the parsed values.  
  
### Returns

**bool** Returns `true` if the string representation is successfully parsed.
Otherwise, returns `false`

### Description

Tries to parse the string representation of a GlobalObjectId into a
GlobalObjectId struct.

This method takes the string representation of a unique object identifier and
converts it to a `GlobalObjectId` struct.  
  
Calling this method sets the state of the provided `GlobalObjectId`, but
doesn't attempt to resolve it to an object reference. A return value of `true`
doesn't guarantee that a call to
[GlobalObjectId.GlobalObjectIdentifierToObjectSlow](GlobalObjectId.GlobalObjectIdentifierToObjectSlow.html)
or similar method will succeed.
