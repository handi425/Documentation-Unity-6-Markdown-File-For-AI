**Obsolete** optimizeMesh is deprecated. Use optimizeMeshPolygons and/or
optimizeMeshVertices instead. Note that optimizeMesh false equates to
optimizeMeshPolygons true and optimizeMeshVertices false while optimizeMesh
true equates to both true. public bool optimizeMesh;

### Description

Vertex optimization setting.

The vertices and indices will be reordered for better GPU performance.
Techniques that require strict vertex ordering like mesh morphing or special
particle mesh emitter effects should have this option disabled.
