public [Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) attachedRigidbody;

### Description

The [Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) attached to the
[Collider2D](Collider2D.html).

[Collider2D](Collider2D.html) are automatically attached to a
[Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) on the same [GameObject](GameObject.html) as
the [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) or if none is present then on a
[Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) on the nearest parent
[GameObject](GameObject.html). The property will be null if no
[Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) is attached. In this case, the
[Collider2D](Collider2D.html) is attached to a hidden body known as the ground
body that lives at the world origin as is set to be
[RigidbodyType2D.Static](RigidbodyType2D.Static.html). No reference to this
hidden body is available however.

        void Start()
        {
            // Apply a force to the rigidbody attached to the collider.
            GetComponent<[Collider2D](Collider2D.html)>().attachedRigidbody.AddForce(force);
        }
