[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-AudioSource.html "Go to AudioSource
Component in the Manual")

public bool isPlaying;

### Description

Returns whether the AudioSource is currently playing an
[AudioResource](Audio.AudioResource.html)(Read Only).

AudioSource.isPlaying returns true if the [AudioSource](AudioSource.html) is
playing any [AudioResource](Audio.AudioResource.html), such as
[AudioClip](AudioClip.html) or AudioRandomContainer. This includes if you use
PlayOneShot() or if you play a video or timeline track through the
AudioSource.  
  
**Note:** [AudioSource.isPlaying](AudioSource-isPlaying.html) returns _false_
when `AudioSource.Pause()` is called. If you use `AudioSource.Play()` back
again, it returns true.  
  
**Note:** If you use [AudioSource.PlayDelayed](AudioSource.PlayDelayed.html)
to play your clip, AudioSource.isPlaying returns true during the delay.

    
    
    // When the audio component has stopped playing, play otherClip.
    // Remember to assign an [AudioClip](AudioClip.html) in the Inspector.  
      
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public [AudioClip](AudioClip.html) otherClip;
        [AudioSource](AudioSource.html) audioSource;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            audioSource = GetComponent<[AudioSource](AudioSource.html)>();
        }  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            if (!audioSource.isPlaying)
            { 
                audioSource.clip = otherClip;
                audioSource.Play();
            }
        }
    }
