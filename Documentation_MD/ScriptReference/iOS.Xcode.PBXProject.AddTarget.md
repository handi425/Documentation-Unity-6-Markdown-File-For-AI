## Declaration

public string AddTarget(string name, string ext, string type);

### Parameters

name | The name of the new target.  
---|---  
ext | The file extension of the target artifact. **Note** : Adding a leading `.` isn't necessary, but is accepted.  
type | The type of the target. For example, `com.apple.product-type.app-extension` or `com.apple.product-type.application.watchapp2`.  
  
### Returns

**string** The GUID of the new target.

### Description

Creates a new native target.

Target-specific build configurations are automatically created for each known
build configuration name. Note, that this is a requirement that follows from
the structure of Xcode projects, not an implementation detail of this
function. The function creates a product file reference in the `Products`
project folder which refers to the target artifact built via this target.

            pbxProject.ReadFromFile(projectPath);  
      
            // Add a new [Target](GraphicsBuffer.Target.html) to the project by specifying its name, extension and target type
            // You can later use the returned targetGuid to modify the target
            string targetGuid = pbxProject.AddTarget("exampleTarget", "app", "com.apple.product-type.bundle");  
      
            // Apply changes to the pbxproj file
            pbxProject.WriteToFile(projectPath);
        }
