public bool isReadable;

### Description

Whether Unity stores an additional copy of this texture's pixel data in CPU-
addressable memory.

This is required for methods that read, write, and manipulate the pixel data
on the CPU, such as [Texture2D.GetPixels](Texture2D.GetPixels.html) or
[ImageConversion.EncodeToPNG](ImageConversion.EncodeToPNG.html). It is not
required for methods that perform all their work on the GPU, such as
[Graphics.CopyTexture](Graphics.CopyTexture.html) or
[Graphics.Blit](Graphics.Blit.html).  
  
By default, this is `false` for texture assets that you import into your
project. To toggle this, use the **Read/Write Enabled** setting in the
[Texture Import Settings](../Manual/class-TextureImporter.html), or set
[TextureImporter.isReadable](TextureImporter-isReadable.html).  
  
By default, this is `true` when you create a texture from a script.  
  
**Note:** Readable textures use more memory than non-readable textures. You
should only make a texture readable when you need to, and you should make
textures non-readable when you are done working with the data on the CPU.  
  
To make a texture non-readable at runtime, call the `Apply` method for your
type of texture, for example [Texture2D.Apply](Texture2D.Apply.html) or
[Cubemap.Apply](Cubemap.Apply.html) and set the `makeNoLongerReadable`
parameter to `true`.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
