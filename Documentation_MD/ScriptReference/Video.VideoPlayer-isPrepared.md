[ ]()

public bool isPrepared;

### Description

Returns whether the [VideoPlayer](Video.VideoPlayer.html) has successfully
prepared the content to be played.

A prepared VideoPlayer can play back the content instantly because preliminary
parsing and buffering has been done.  
  
A VideoPlayer starts out as not prepared (`false`). To prepare the
VideoPlayer, you need to use
[VideoPlayer.Prepare](Video.VideoPlayer.Prepare.html). When preparation is
done, the VideoPlayer emits the
[VideoPlayer.prepareCompleted](Video.VideoPlayer-prepareCompleted.html) event,
which sets `isPrepared` to `true`.  
  
The property goes back to `false` when you or the VideoPlayer calls
[VideoPlayer.Stop](Video.VideoPlayer.Stop.html).  
  
If there are preparation failures, this property might never be set to `true`.
In this case, Unity sends an error description through the
[VideoPlayer.errorReceived](Video.VideoPlayer-errorReceived.html) event.  
  
Additional resources: [VideoPlayer.Prepare](Video.VideoPlayer.Prepare.html).

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.Video;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    // In the Inspector of your [GameObject](GameObject.html), attach this script and a [VideoPlayer](Video.VideoPlayer.html) component. 
    // Also, assign a [VideoClip](Video.VideoClip.html) to your [VideoPlayer](Video.VideoPlayer.html) component.  
    // Use this script to prepare a video.    
      
    public class IsPreparedExample : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public IEnumerator Start()
        {
            [VideoPlayer](Video.VideoPlayer.html) videoPlayer = GetComponent<[VideoPlayer](Video.VideoPlayer.html)>();
            videoPlayer.Prepare();
            // Loops until the video is ready.
            // Then outputs the message to the console when the preparation is done. 
            while (!videoPlayer.isPrepared)
            {
                yield return null;
            }
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("Preparation completed!");
        }
    }
