### Description

The light probe shader uniform values are extracted from the material property
block set on the renderer.

Property `unity_SHAr`, `unity_SHAg`, `unity_SHAb`, `unity_SHBr`, `unity_SHBg`,
`unity_SHBb` and `unity_SHC` will be set to zero if they are not part of the
MaterialPropertyBlock.  
Property `unity_ProbesOcclusion` will be calculated as in normal lighting if
it is not part of the MaterialPropertyBlock.  
  
Note that using the light probe values baked at a different place may lead to
incorrect rendering, especially when local lights (i.e. point lights and spot
lights) are used. This mode is more useful when drawing instanced objects with
[Graphics.DrawMeshInstanced](Graphics.DrawMeshInstanced.html), where the light
probe data is pre-calculated and provided as arrays.
