## Declaration

public static [Vector3](Vector3.html) Reflect([Vector3](Vector3.html)
inDirection, [Vector3](Vector3.html) inNormal);

### Parameters

inDirection | The direction vector towards the plane.  
---|---  
inNormal | The normal vector that defines the plane.  
  
### Description

Reflects a vector off the plane defined by a normal.

This method calculates the reflection vector using the following formula: v =
inDirection - 2 * inNormal * dot(inDirection inNormal). The `inNormal` vector
defines a plane. A plane's normal is the vector that is perpendicular to its
surface. The `inDirection` vector is treated as a directional arrow coming
into the plane. The returned value is a vector of equal magnitude to
`inDirection` but with its direction reflected.
