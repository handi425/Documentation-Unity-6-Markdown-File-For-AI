[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-ArticulationBody.html "Go to
ArticulationBody Component in the Manual")

## Declaration

public void PublishTransform();

### Description

Reads the position and rotation of the Articulation Body from the physics
system and applies it to the corresponding [Transform](Transform.html)
component.

Note: This method doesn't update the child Transforms. It should be called
from the topmost Transform, down the hierarchy.

    
    
    using System.Linq;
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class ExampleScript : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        private [PhysicsScene](PhysicsScene.html) m_SomeScene;
        private [ArticulationBody](ArticulationBody.html) m_RootArticulation;  
      
        public void SimulateTrajectory(float totalTime)
        {
            m_SomeScene.RunSimulationStages(0f, [SimulationStage.PrepareSimulation](SimulationStage.PrepareSimulation.html));  
      
            for (int i = 0; i < totalTime / [Time.fixedDeltaTime](Time-fixedDeltaTime.html); i++)
                m_SomeScene.RunSimulationStages([Time.fixedDeltaTime](Time-fixedDeltaTime.html), [SimulationStage.RunSimulation](SimulationStage.RunSimulation.html));  
      
            // Transforms of the [ArticulationBody](ArticulationBody.html) tree are still like they were at the start of the method  
      
            var links = m_RootArticulation.gameObject.GetComponentsInChildren<[ArticulationBody](ArticulationBody.html)>().ToList();
            links.Sort((a0, a1) => a0.index.CompareTo(a1.index));
            foreach (var ab in links)
                ab.PublishTransform();  
      
            // Transforms of the [ArticulationBody](ArticulationBody.html) tree are now up to date and can be accessed to see where the bodies ended up after simulating for "totalTime" seconds
        }  
      
        // Teleports the root body of the Articulation and applies the resulting position and rotation to the [Transform](Transform.html) component
        public void TeleportAndUpdate([Vector3](Vector3.html) position, [Quaternion](Quaternion.html) rotation)
        {
            m_RootArticulation.TeleportRoot(position, rotation);
            m_RootArticulation.PublishTransform();
        }
    }
    

Simulate a [PhysicsScene](PhysicsScene.html) with an
[ArticulationBody](ArticulationBody.html) and use
[PublishTransform](ArticulationBody.PublishTransform.html) to read the
information from the physics system to the [Transform](Transform.html)
component.
