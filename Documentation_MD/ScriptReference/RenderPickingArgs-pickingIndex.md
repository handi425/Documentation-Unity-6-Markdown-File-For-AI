public int pickingIndex;

### Description

Specifies the picking index value that the first pickable object uses to write
to the picking render texture.

The picking index must be encoded to a [Vector4](Vector4.html) `selectionId`
value that uses
[HandleUtility.EncodeSelectionId](HandleUtility.EncodeSelectionId.html), and
output from the shader. If you are rendering more than one pickable object in
the callback, increment the `pickingIndex` for every additional object.  
  
Additional resources:
[HandleUtility.EncodeSelectionId](HandleUtility.EncodeSelectionId.html).
