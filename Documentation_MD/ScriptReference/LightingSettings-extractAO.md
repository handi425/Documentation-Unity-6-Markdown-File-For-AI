[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-LightingSettings.html "Go to
LightingSettings Component in the Manual")

public bool extractAO;

### Description

Whether the Progressive Lightmapper extracts Ambient Occlusion to a separate
lightmap. (Editor only).

When this is set to `true`, Unity saves the filtered Ambient Occlusion (AO)
texture to disk as a separate lightmap, in addition to applying it to the
regular lightmaps. When this is set to `false`, Unity does not save the
filtered AO texture to disk separately.  
  
Use this if you need to access the AO data separately.  
  
Note that the values from [aoExponentDirect](LightingSettings-
aoExponentDirect.html) and [aoExponentIndirect](LightingSettings-
aoExponentIndirect.html) are not applied; instead, the default values are
used. The resulting lightmap is saved to disk in the same location as the
other lightmaps.  
  
This only works when [autoGenerate](LightingSettings-autoGenerate.html) is set
to `false`, and [ao](LightingSettings-ao.html) is set to `true`.

LightingSettings.html), [trainingDataDestination](LightingSettings-
trainingDataDestination.html).
