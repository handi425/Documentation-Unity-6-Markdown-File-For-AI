public static float niceMouseDelta;

### Description

Get nice mouse delta to use for dragging a float value (Read Only).

This will autodetect the users preference for X / Y axis dragging and give you
back a float that is measured accordingly. This also handles modifier keys
correctly, i.e. the delta is already multiplied by
[acceleration](HandleUtility-acceleration.html).  
  
Additional resources: [acceleration](HandleUtility-acceleration.html),
[niceMouseDeltaZoom](HandleUtility-niceMouseDeltaZoom.html).
