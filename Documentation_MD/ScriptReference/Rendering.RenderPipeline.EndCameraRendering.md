## Declaration

protected static void
EndCameraRendering([Rendering.ScriptableRenderContext](Rendering.ScriptableRenderContext.html)
context, [Camera](Camera.html) camera);

### Description

Calls the
[RenderPipelineManager.endCameraRendering](Rendering.RenderPipelineManager-
endCameraRendering.html) delegate.

In the Universal Render Pipeline (URP) and the High Definition Render Pipeline
(HDRP), Unity calls this method automatically after performing rendering
operations for an individual Camera. If you are writing a custom Scriptable
Render Pipeline, you can call this method manually to use the
[RenderPipelineManager.endCameraRendering](Rendering.RenderPipelineManager-
endCameraRendering.html) delegate.  
  
The following code example demonstrates where to call this method if you are
creating a custom Scriptable Render Pipeline:

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.Rendering;  
      
    public class ExampleRenderPipelineInstance : [RenderPipeline](Rendering.RenderPipeline.html)
    {
        public ExampleRenderPipelineInstance()
        {
        }  
      
        override protected void Render([ScriptableRenderContext](Rendering.ScriptableRenderContext.html) context, [Camera](Camera.html)[] cameras)
        {
            for (var i = 0; i < cameras.Length; i++)
            {
                var camera = cameras[i];  
      
                // Put your code for rendering the [Camera](Camera.html) here  
      
                // Call the [RenderPipelineManager.endCameraRendering](Rendering.RenderPipelineManager-endCameraRendering.html) delegate
                EndCameraRendering(context, camera);
            }
        }
    }
