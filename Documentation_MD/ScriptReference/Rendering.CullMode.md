### Description

Determines which faces Unity culls.

The following example shows how to use this enum to set the culling mode of a
GameObject from a C# script.  
  
Use the following code in your shader to declare the `_Cull` property that you
can change from a C# script:

    
    
                            [Shader](Shader.html) "Example/SetCullMode"
                            {
                                Properties
                                {
                                    [Enum(UnityEngine.Rendering.CullMode)] _Cull ("Cull", Integer) = 1
                                }
                                SubShader
                                {
                                    Cull [_Cull]
                                    // Insert your shader code here
                                }
                            }
    

In a C# script, use the following code to change the `CullMode` property:

    
    
                            public void SetCullMode()
                            {
                                _material.SetInteger("_Cull", (int)UnityEngine.Rendering.CullMode.Back);
                            }
    

### Properties

[Off](Rendering.CullMode.Off.html)| Disable culling.  
---|---  
[Front](Rendering.CullMode.Front.html)| Cull front-facing geometry.  
[Back](Rendering.CullMode.Back.html)| Cull back-facing geometry.
