### Description

The [ArticulationBody](ArticulationBody.html) of the collider that was hit. If
the collider is not attached to an articulation body then it is `null`.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        // Apply a force to a clicked articulationBody object.  
      
        // The force applied to an object when hit.
        float hitForce;  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            if ([Input.GetMouseButtonDown](Input.GetMouseButtonDown.html)(0))
            {
                [RaycastHit](RaycastHit.html) hit;
                [Ray](Ray.html) ray = Camera.main.ScreenPointToRay([Input.mousePosition](Input-mousePosition.html));  
      
                if ([Physics.Raycast](Physics.Raycast.html)(ray, out hit))
                {
                    if (hit.articulationBody != null)
                    {
                        hit.articulationBody.AddForce(ray.direction * hitForce);
                    }
                }
            }
