public float playRate;

### Description

A multiplier that Unity applies to the delta time when it updates the
VisualEffect. The default value is 1.0f.

To play the visual effect faster than normal, set this property to a value
greater than 1.0f. To play the visual effect slower than normal, set this
property to a value between 0.0f and 1.0f. Unity does not serialize this
property. This means that, after loading, it automatically resets to the
default value.
