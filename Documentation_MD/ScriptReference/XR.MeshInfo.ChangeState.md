public [XR.MeshChangeState](XR.MeshChangeState.html) ChangeState;

### Description

The change state (e.g., Added, Removed) of the tracked mesh.

The `ChangeState` is relative to the last call to
[XRMeshSubsystem.TryGetMeshInfos](XR.XRMeshSubsystem.TryGetMeshInfos.html).
For example, a value of [MeshChangeState.Added](XR.MeshChangeState.Added.html)
indicates the mesh has been added since the last call to `TryGetMeshInfos`.
