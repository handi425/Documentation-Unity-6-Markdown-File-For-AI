### Description

Describes 4 skinning bone weights that affect a vertex in a mesh.

Elements in this struct must be in descending order of weight value. The sum
of all weight values must be 1. If a vertex is affected by fewer than 4 bones,
each of the remaining weight values must be 0.  
  
Note that this struct, and the associated [Mesh.boneWeights](Mesh-
boneWeights.html) and [Mesh.GetBoneWeights](Mesh.GetBoneWeights.html) APIs,
describe exactly 4 bone weights per vertex. The newer
[BoneWeight1](BoneWeight1.html) struct describes a single bone weight, and it
can be used with the associated
[Mesh.GetAllBoneWeights](Mesh.GetAllBoneWeights.html),
[Mesh.SetBoneWeights](Mesh.SetBoneWeights.html) and
[Mesh.GetBonesPerVertex](Mesh.GetBonesPerVertex.html) APIs to describe up to
255 bone weights per vertex. It is preferable to use
[BoneWeight1](BoneWeight1.html) and its associated APIs; they offer more
flexibility, and might result in small performance benefits as Unity does not
have to perform unnessary conversion operations.
