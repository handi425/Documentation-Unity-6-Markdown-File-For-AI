## Declaration

public int
GetVertexAttributeOffset([Rendering.VertexAttribute](Rendering.VertexAttribute.html)
attr);

### Parameters

attr | The vertex data attribute to check for.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**int** The byte offset within a atream of the data attribute, or -1 if it is
not present.

### Description

Gets the offset within a vertex buffer stream of a given vertex data attribute
on this `MeshData`.

Meshes usually use a single vertex buffer stream, but it is possible to set up
a vertex layout where attributes use different vertex buffers (see
[SetVertexBufferParams](Mesh.MeshData.SetVertexBufferParams.html)). When you
use such a layout, use this function to query where a given attribute is
located in a stream.  
  
Note that this function returns the byte offset within a stream, without
specifying which stream. To identify the stream that contains a given
attribute, use
[GetVertexAttributeStream](Mesh.MeshData.GetVertexAttributeStream.html).
