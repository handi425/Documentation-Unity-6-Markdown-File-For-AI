## Declaration

public static Object LoadAssetAtPath(string assetPath, Type type);

### Parameters

assetPath | Path of the asset to load.  
---|---  
type | Data type of the asset.  
  
### Returns

**Object** The asset matching the parameters.

### Description

Returns the first asset object of type **type** at given path **assetPath**.

Some asset files may contain multiple objects. (such as a Maya file which may
contain multiple Meshes and GameObjects). All paths are relative to the
project folder, for example: "Assets/MyTextures/hello.png".  
  
**Note:**  
The **assetPath** parameter is not case sensitive.  
**ALL** asset names and paths in Unity use forward slashes, even on Windows.  
This returns only an asset object that is visible in the Project view. If the
asset is not found `LoadAssetAtPath` returns Null.
