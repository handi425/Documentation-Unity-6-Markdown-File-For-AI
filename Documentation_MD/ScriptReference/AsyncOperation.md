### Description

Asynchronous operation coroutine.

You can **yield** until asynchronous operation continues, or manually check
whether it's done ([isDone](AsyncOperation-isDone.html)) or progress
([progress](AsyncOperation-progress.html)).  
  
Additional resources:
[SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync](SceneManagement.SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync.html),
[AssetBundle.LoadAssetAsync](AssetBundle.LoadAssetAsync.html),
[Resources.LoadAsync](Resources.LoadAsync.html).

### Properties

[allowSceneActivation](AsyncOperation-allowSceneActivation.html)| Allow Scenes
to be activated as soon as it is ready.  
---|---  
[isDone](AsyncOperation-isDone.html)| Has the operation finished? (Read Only)  
[priority](AsyncOperation-priority.html)| Priority lets you tweak in which
order async operation calls will be performed.  
[progress](AsyncOperation-progress.html)| What's the operation's progress.
(Read Only)  
  
### Events

[completed](AsyncOperation-completed.html)| Event that is invoked upon
operation completion. An event handler that is registered in the same frame as
the call that creates it will be invoked next frame, even if the operation is
able to complete synchronously. If a handler is registered after the operation
has completed and has already invoked the complete event, the handler will be
called synchronously.
