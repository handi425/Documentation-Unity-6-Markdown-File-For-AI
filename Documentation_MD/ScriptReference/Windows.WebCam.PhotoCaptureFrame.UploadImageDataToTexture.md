## Declaration

public void UploadImageDataToTexture([Texture2D](Texture2D.html)
targetTexture);

### Parameters

targetTexture | The target texture that the captured image data will be copied to.  
---|---  
  
### Description

This method will copy the captured image data into a user supplied texture for
use in Unity.

You may only use this method if you specified the **BGRA32** format in your
[CameraParameters](Windows.WebCam.CameraParameters.html). Keep in mind that
this operation will happen on the main thread and therefore be slow. The
captured image will also appear flipped on the HoloLens. You can reorient the
image by using a custom shader.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
**Known Issue**. Please check with the Issue Tracker at
