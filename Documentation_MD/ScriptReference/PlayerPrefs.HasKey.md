## Declaration

public static bool HasKey(string key);

### Description

Returns true if the given `key` exists in PlayerPrefs, otherwise returns
false.

The following example demonstrates using PlayerPrefs.HasKey in a conditional
statement. It prints one message to the console if the conditional statement
returns true (if the key does exist in the `PlayerPrefs` data), and a
different message if the conditional statement returns false (if the key does
not exist in the `PlayerPrefs` data).

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public void HasKey(string KeyName)
        {
            if ([PlayerPrefs.HasKey](PlayerPrefs.HasKey.html)(KeyName))
            {
                [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("The key " + KeyName + " exists");
            }
            else
                [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("The key " + KeyName + " does not exist");
        }
    }
