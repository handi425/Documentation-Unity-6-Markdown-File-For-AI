### Description

Tells an [Editor](Editor.html) class which run-time type it's an editor for.

When you make a custom editor for a component, put this attribute on the
editor class.  
  
To set which `Editor` classes are active for the current Render Pipeline
Asset, add a
[SupportedOnRenderPipelineAttribute](Rendering.SupportedOnRenderPipelineAttribute.html)
underneath the attribute.  
  
Additional resources: [Editor](Editor.html) class,
[SupportedOnRenderPipelineAttribute](Rendering.SupportedOnRenderPipelineAttribute.html).

### Properties

[isFallback](CustomEditor-isFallback.html)| If true, match this editor only if
all non-fallback editors do not match. Defaults to false.  
---|---
