### Description

Provides a static implementation of [ObjectPool<T0>](Pool.ObjectPool_1.html).

The GenericPool has collection checks enabled that ensure that when an
instance is released it is not already in the pool. Note this is not thread-
safe. Additional resources:
[UnsafeGenericPool<T0>](Pool.UnsafeGenericPool_1.html).

    
    
    using UnityEngine.Pool;  
      
    public class GenericPoolExample
    {
        class MyClass
        {
            public int someValue;
            public string someString;
        }  
      
        void GetPooled()
        {
            // Get an instance
            var instance = GenericPool<MyClass>.Get();  
      
            // Return the instance
            GenericPool<MyClass>.Release(instance);
        }
    }
