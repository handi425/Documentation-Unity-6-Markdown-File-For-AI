### Description

Shortcut for an empty GUIStyle.

This style contains no decoration and just renders everything in the default
font.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void OnGUI()
        {
            // Make a button with no decoration
            [GUI.Button](GUI.Button.html)(new [Rect](Rect.html)(0, 0, 250, 100), "Basic [Button](UIElements.Button.html)", [GUIStyle.none](GUIStyle-none.html));
        }
    }
