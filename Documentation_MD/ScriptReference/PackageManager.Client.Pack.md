## Declaration

public static
[PackageManager.Requests.PackRequest](PackageManager.Requests.PackRequest.html)
Pack(string packageFolder, string targetFolder);

### Parameters

packageFolder | Folder containing the package. `ArgumentException` is thrown if `packageFolder` is `null` or empty.  
---|---  
targetFolder | Folder where the Package Manager will write the GZip tarball file. The Package Manager will create this folder if it does not already exist. `ArgumentException` is thrown if `targetFolder` is `null` or empty.  
  
### Returns

**PackRequest** A [PackRequest](PackageManager.Requests.PackRequest.html)
instance, which you can use to get the
[PackOperationResult](PackageManager.PackOperationResult.html) representing
the path of the generated tarball from the `PackRequest.Result` property.

### Description

Creates a GZip tarball file from a package folder. The format and content of
the file is the same as if the package was published to a package registry.

`Pack()` is an asynchronous operation. Before the operation is complete, you
can use the `PackRequest` instance to monitor the asynchronous operation.  
  
**Note:** Make sure any other Client operations have completed before calling
this method. For more information, see the note on the
[Client](PackageManager.Client.html) class reference page.
