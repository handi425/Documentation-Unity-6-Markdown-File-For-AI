## Declaration

public void UpdateInstanceTransform(int handle, [Matrix4x4](Matrix4x4.html)
matrix);

### Parameters

handle | The handle associated with a AABB or Mesh ray tracing instance.  
---|---  
matrix | The new transformation matrix of the ray tracing instance.  
  
### Description

Updates the transformation of a ray tracing instance.

Pass along a new transformation matrix and the handle
[RayTracingAccelerationStructure.AddInstance](Rendering.RayTracingAccelerationStructure.AddInstance.html)
returns in order to transform a ray tracing instance associated with a axis-
aligned bounding box (AABB) [GraphicsBuffer](GraphicsBuffer.html) or a
[Mesh](Mesh.html).  
  
Access the transformation matrix in shader code using `WorldToObject()` or
`ObjectToWorld()` HLSL functions.  
  
To trigger an acceleration structure build on the GPU, call
[RayTracingAccelerationStructure.Build](Rendering.RayTracingAccelerationStructure.Build.html)
or
[CommandBuffer.BuildRayTracingAccelerationStructure](Rendering.CommandBuffer.BuildRayTracingAccelerationStructure.html).
