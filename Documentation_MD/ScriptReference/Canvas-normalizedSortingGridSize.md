public float normalizedSortingGridSize;

### Description

The normalized grid size that the canvas will split the renderable area into.

During rendering, the canvas splits the renderable area (bounds of all UI
elements) into a grid. This is the normalized size of that grid. For example
if you have a renderable area of 100 units with a sortingGridNormalizedSize of
0.1f then each grid cell would be 10 units.  
  
Note: a value of 0 will default to 0.1f.
