## Declaration

public static [Unity.Jobs.JobHandle](Unity.Jobs.JobHandle.html)
CloseCachedFileAsync(string fileName,
[Unity.Jobs.JobHandle](Unity.Jobs.JobHandle.html) dependency);

### Parameters

fileName | The path to the file to close.  
---|---  
dependency | (Optional) A JobHandle to wait on before performing the close.  
  
### Returns

**JobHandle** A JobHandle that completes when the asynchronous close operation
finishes.

### Description

Closes a file held open internally by the AsyncReadManager.

The AsyncReadManager has an internal cache of up to 10 open files, so use this
method if you experience a sharing violation when trying to access one of
these files that is held open.  
  
Note: Do not use this method for files opened with
[OpenFileAsync](Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.AsyncReadManager.OpenFileAsync.html),
as these files do not go into the AsyncReadManager's file cache. Use
[FileHandle.Close](Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.FileHandle.Close.html) instead.
