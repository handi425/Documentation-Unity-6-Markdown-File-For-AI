### Description

Continuous collision detection is on for colliding with static and dynamic
geometry.

Prevent this Rigidbody from passing through static mesh geometry, and through
other Rigidbodies which have continuous collision detection enabled, when it
is moving fast. This is the slowest collision detection mode, and should only
be used for selected fast moving objects.

    
    
    //This script allows you to switch collision detection mode at the press of the space key
    //Attach this script to a [GameObject](GameObject.html)
    //Click the [GameObject](GameObject.html), go to its Inspector and click the **Add Component** [Button](UIElements.Button.html). Then, go to **Physics** >**Rigidbody**.
