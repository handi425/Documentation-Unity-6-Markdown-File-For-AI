## Declaration

public static bool CapsuleCast([Vector3](Vector3.html) point1,
[Vector3](Vector3.html) point2, float radius, [Vector3](Vector3.html)
direction, float maxDistance = Mathf.Infinity, int layerMask =
DefaultRaycastLayers, [QueryTriggerInteraction](QueryTriggerInteraction.html)
queryTriggerInteraction = QueryTriggerInteraction.UseGlobal);

### Parameters

point1 | The center of the sphere at the `start` of the capsule.  
---|---  
point2 | The center of the sphere at the `end` of the capsule.  
radius | The radius of the capsule.  
direction | The direction into which to sweep the capsule.  
maxDistance | The max length of the sweep.  
layerMask | A [Layer mask](../Manual/Layers.html) that is used to selectively ignore colliders when casting a capsule.  
queryTriggerInteraction | Specifies whether this query should hit Triggers.  
  
### Returns

**bool** True when the capsule sweep intersects any collider, otherwise false.

### Description

Casts a capsule against all colliders in the Scene and returns detailed
information on what was hit.

The capsule is defined by the two spheres with `radius` around `point1` and
`point2`, which form the two ends of the capsule. Hits are returned for the
first collider which would collide against this capsule if the capsule was
moved along `direction`. This is useful when a Raycast does not give enough
precision, because you want to find out if an object of a specific size, such
as a character, will be able to move somewhere without colliding with anything
on the way.  
  
**Notes:** CapsuleCast will not detect colliders for which the capsule
overlaps the collider. Passing a zero radius results in undefined output and
doesn't always behave the same as [Physics.Raycast](Physics.Raycast.html).

            float distanceToObstacle = 0;  
      
            // Cast character controller shape 10 meters forward to see if it is about to hit anything.
            if ([Physics.CapsuleCast](Physics.CapsuleCast.html)(p1, p2, charContr.radius, transform.forward, out hit, 10))
                distanceToObstacle = hit.distance;
        }
    }

### Parameters

point1 | The center of the sphere at the `start` of the capsule.  
---|---  
point2 | The center of the sphere at the `end` of the capsule.  
radius | The radius of the capsule.  
direction | The direction into which to sweep the capsule.  
maxDistance | The max length of the sweep.  
hitInfo | If true is returned, `hitInfo` will contain more information about where the collider was hit. (Additional resources: [RaycastHit](RaycastHit.html)).  
layerMask | A [Layer mask](../Manual/Layers.html) that is used to selectively ignore colliders when casting a capsule.  
queryTriggerInteraction | Specifies whether this query should hit Triggers.
