        {
            var bridgeClass = AndroidApplication.unityPlayer.Call<string>("toString");
            var isActivity = bridgeClass.StartsWith("com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayerForActivityOrService");
            var isGameActivity = bridgeClass.StartsWith("com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayerForGameActivity");
