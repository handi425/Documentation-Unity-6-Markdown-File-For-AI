**Obsolete** HTTP/2 and many HTTP/1.1 servers don't support this; we recommend
leaving it set to false (default). public bool chunkedTransfer;

### Description

**Deprecated.**. HTTP/2 and many HTTP/1.1 servers don't support this; we
recommend leaving it set to false (default).

This property indicates whether the
[UnityWebRequest](Networking.UnityWebRequest.html) should employ the HTTP/1.1
chunked-transfer encoding method, which allows the system to send partial data
and be prompted by the server for more data with a 100/Continue HTTP response.
This property cannot be changed after calling
[Send](Networking.UnityWebRequest.Send.html).  
  
**Note:** On WebGL build targets, this setting is ignored. Instead, the web
browser handles protocol negotiations.  
  
_Default value:_ `false`.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
**Known Issue**. Please check with the Issue Tracker at
