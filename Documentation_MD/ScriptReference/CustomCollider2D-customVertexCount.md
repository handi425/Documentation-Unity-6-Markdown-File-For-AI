public int customVertexCount;

### Description

The total number of [vertices](Vector2.html) used by the Collider. (Read Only)

All the Collider shapes with a total shape count of
[customShapeCount](CustomCollider2D-customShapeCount.html) use all the
vertices represented here.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.Assertions;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            // Fetch the custom collider.
            var customCollider = GetComponent<[CustomCollider2D](CustomCollider2D.html)>();  
      
            // Create a shape group.
            var shapeGroup = new [PhysicsShapeGroup2D](PhysicsShapeGroup2D.html)();  
      
            // Add a Circle to the shape group.
            shapeGroup.AddCircle
                (
                    center: new [Vector2](Vector2.html)(-1f, 0f),
                    radius: 0.5f
                );  
      
            // Add a box to the shape group.
            shapeGroup.AddBox
                (
                    center: new [Vector2](Vector2.html)(1f, 0f),
                    size: new [Vector2](Vector2.html)(1f, 1f)
                );  
      
            // Assign our shapes.
            customCollider.SetCustomShapes(shapeGroup);  
      
            // Validate the custom shape vertices.
            [Assert.AreApproximatelyEqual](Assertions.Assert.AreApproximatelyEqual.html)(shapeGroup.vertexCount, customCollider.customVertexCount);
        }
    }
