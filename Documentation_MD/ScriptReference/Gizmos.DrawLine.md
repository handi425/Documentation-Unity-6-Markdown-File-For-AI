## Declaration

public static void DrawLine([Vector3](Vector3.html) from,
[Vector3](Vector3.html) to);

### Description

Draws a line starting at `from` towards `to`.

If you need to draw many lines consider the
[Gizmos.DrawLineList](Gizmos.DrawLineList.html) or
[Gizmos.DrawLineStrip](Gizmos.DrawLineStrip.html) functions which are much
faster than repeatedly calling this function to draw lines individually.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public [Transform](Transform.html) target;  
      
        void OnDrawGizmosSelected()
        {
            if (target != null)
            {
                // Draws a blue line from this transform to the target
                [Gizmos.color](Gizmos-color.html) = [Color.blue](Color-blue.html);
                [Gizmos.DrawLine](Gizmos.DrawLine.html)(transform.position, target.position);
            }
        }
    }
