### Description

The ClothSkinningCoefficient struct is used to set up how a
[Cloth](Cloth.html) component is allowed to move with respect to the
[SkinnedMeshRenderer](SkinnedMeshRenderer.html) it is attached to.

This is set using the [Cloth.coefficients](Cloth-coefficients.html) property
on the Cloth component, which is a per-vertex array of
ClothSkinningCoefficient structs. Typically, you will not set these values
from code, but instead, set them up in the editor which shows up when you look
at the Cloth component in the inspector.

### Properties

[collisionSphereDistance](ClothSkinningCoefficient-
collisionSphereDistance.html)| Definition of a sphere a vertex is not allowed
to enter. This allows collision against the animated cloth.  
---|---  
[maxDistance](ClothSkinningCoefficient-maxDistance.html)| Distance a vertex is
allowed to travel from the skinned mesh vertex position.
