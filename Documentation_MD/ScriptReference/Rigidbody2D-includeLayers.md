public [LayerMask](LayerMask.html) includeLayers;

### Description

The additional Layers that all [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) attached to this
[Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) should include when deciding if a contact with
another [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) should happen or not.

The Layer Collision Matrix defines which Layers can and cannot contact other
Layers. This property allows you to specify additional Layers that all
[Collider2D](Collider2D.html) attached to this [Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html)
instance can contact.  
  
**NOTE** : Because Layers can be included or excluded differently depending on
the settings of each [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) instance, there is the
potential for a conflicting decision for whether contact should happen or not
when two [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) instances come into contact with each
other. You can find the detailed rules for how Unity arbitrates this decision
in the
[Collider2D.layerOverridePriority](Collider2D-layerOverridePriority.html)
documentation.
