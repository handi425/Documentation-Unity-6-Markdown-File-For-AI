## Declaration

public delegate void CapFunction(int controlID, [Vector3](Vector3.html)
position, [Quaternion](Quaternion.html) rotation, float size,
[EventType](EventType.html) eventType);

### Parameters

controlID | The control ID for the handle.  
---|---  
position | The position of the handle in the space of [Handles.matrix](Handles-matrix.html).  
rotation | The rotation of the handle in the space of [Handles.matrix](Handles-matrix.html).  
size | The size of the handle in world-space units.  
eventType | Event type for the handle to act upon. By design it handles [EventType.Layout](EventType.Layout.html) and [EventType.Repaint](EventType.Repaint.html) events.  
  
### Description

The function to use for drawing the handle e.g. Handles.RectangleCap.

Custom CapFunction has two responsibilities:

  1. For [EventType.Layout](EventType.Layout.html) event, call [HandleUtility.AddControl](HandleUtility.AddControl.html) to inform Unity about the distance of the handle from mouse position.
  2. For [EventType.Repaint](EventType.Repaint.html) event, render the actual handle.
