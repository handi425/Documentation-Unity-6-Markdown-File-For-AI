### Description

Speculative continuous collision detection is on for static and dynamic
geometries

This is a collision detection mode that can be used on both dyanmic and
kinematic objects. It is generally cheaper than other CCD mode. It also
handles angular motion much better. However, in some cases, high speed objects
may still tunneling through other geometries.

    
    
    //This script allows you to switch collision detection mode at the press of the space key, and move your [GameObject](GameObject.html). It also outputs collisions that occur to the console.
    //Attach this script to a [GameObject](GameObject.html) and make sure it has a [Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html) component
    //If it doesn't have a [Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html) component, click the [GameObject](GameObject.html), go to its Inspector and click the **Add Component** button. Then, go to **Physics** >**Rigidbody**.
    //Create another [GameObject](GameObject.html). Make sure it has a [Collider](Collider.html), so you can test collisions between them.
