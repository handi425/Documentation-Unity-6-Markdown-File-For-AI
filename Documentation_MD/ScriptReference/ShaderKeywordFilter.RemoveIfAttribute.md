### Description

Remove the specified shader keywords from the build if the data field matches
the condition.

If the data field under `RemoveIf` matches the value of `condition`, Unity
removes `keywordNames` in any `multi_compile` keyword set.

    
    
    using UnityEditor.ShaderKeywordFilter;  
      
    [RemoveIf(false, keywordNames: "FeatureA")]
    bool enableFeatureA;

### Constructors

the specified shader keywords from the build if the data field matches the
condition.
