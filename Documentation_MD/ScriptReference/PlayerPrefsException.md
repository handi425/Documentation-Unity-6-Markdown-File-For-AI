### Description

An exception thrown by the [PlayerPrefs](PlayerPrefs.html) class in a web
player build.

The exception is thrown when writing to a preference file exceeds the allotted
storage space. This exception is not thrown on other platforms.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            // create a one megabyte character string
            string s16 = "0123456789abcdef";
            string s1024 = "";
            for (int j = 0; j < 64; j++)
                s1024 += s16;
            string s1024x1024 = "";
            for (int i  = 0; i < 1024; i++)
                s1024x1024 += s1024;  
      
            // try to save the string
            try
            {
                [PlayerPrefs.SetString](PlayerPrefs.SetString.html)("fail", s1024x1024);
            }
            // handle the error
            catch (System.Exception err)
            {
                [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("Got: " + err);
            }
        }
    }
    

Note that web player is not supported from 5.4.0 onwards.
