### Description

Topology of [Mesh](Mesh.html) faces.

Normally meshes are composed of triangles (three vertex indices per face), but
in some cases you might want to render complex things that are made up from
lines or points. Creating a [Mesh](Mesh.html) with that topology and using it
to render is usually the most efficient way.  
  
Additional resources: [Mesh.SetIndices](Mesh.SetIndices.html) function.

### Properties

[Triangles](MeshTopology.Triangles.html)| Mesh is made from triangles.  
---|---  
[Quads](MeshTopology.Quads.html)| Mesh is made from quads.  
[Lines](MeshTopology.Lines.html)| Mesh is made from lines.  
[LineStrip](MeshTopology.LineStrip.html)| Mesh is a line strip.  
[Points](MeshTopology.Points.html)| Mesh is made from points.
