## Declaration

public RaycastCommand([Vector3](Vector3.html) from, [Vector3](Vector3.html)
direction, [QueryParameters](QueryParameters.html) queryParameters, float
distance);

### Parameters

from | The starting point of the ray in world coordinates.  
---|---  
direction | The direction of the ray.  
distance | The maximum distance the ray should check for collisions.  
queryParameters | Structure for specifying additional parameters for a batch query such as layer mask, hit multiple mesh faces, hit triggers and hit backfaces.  
  
### Description

Create a RaycastCommand.

The query is run in the default physics scene.

---|---  
direction | The direction of the ray.  
distance | The maximum distance the ray should check for collisions.  
layerMask | A [LayerMask](LayerMask.html) that is used to selectively ignore Colliders when casting a ray.  
maxHits | The maximum number of Colliders the ray can hit.
