in the Manual")

## Declaration

public void TransformPoints(Span<Vector3> positions);

### Parameters

positions | The positions of the points to be transformed, each is replaced by the transformed version.  
---|---  
  
### Description

Transforms multiple points from local space to world space overwriting each
original point with the transformed version.

Note that the positions of the returned points are affected by scale. Use
[Transform.TransformDirections](Transform.TransformDirections.html) if you are
dealing with direction vectors.  
  
You can perform the opposite conversion, from world to local space using
[Transform.InverseTransformPoints](Transform.InverseTransformPoints.html).

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public [GameObject](GameObject.html) someObject;  
      
        const int kNumPoints = 100;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            // Instantiate 100 objects to the right of the current object
            [Vector3](Vector3.html)[] points = new [Vector3](Vector3.html)[kNumPoints];
            for (int pointNum = 0; pointNum < kNumPoints; pointNum++)
            {
                points[pointNum] = [Vector3.right](Vector3-right.html) * pointNum;
            }
            transform.TransformPoints(points);
            for (int pointNum = 0; pointNum < kNumPoints; pointNum++)
            {
                Instantiate(someObject, points[pointNum], someObject.transform.rotation);
            }
        }
    }

## Declaration

public void TransformPoints(ReadOnlySpan<Vector3> positions, Span<Vector3>
transformedPositions);

### Parameters

positions | The positions of the points to be transformed, these vectors are not modified by the function unless the `transformedPositions` span overlaps.  
---|---  
transformedPositions | Receives the transformed positions of each point, must be the same length as `positions` otherwise an exception will be thrown. If this span overlaps `positions` other than representing the exact same elements the behaviour is undefined.  
  
### Description

Transforms multiple points from local space to world space writing the
transformed points to a possibly different location.

Note that the positions of the returned points are affected by scale. Use
[Transform.TransformDirections](Transform.TransformDirections.html) if you are
dealing with directions.  
  
You can perform the opposite conversion, from world to local space using
[Transform.InverseTransformPoints](Transform.InverseTransformPoints.html).

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public [GameObject](GameObject.html) someObject;  
      
        const int kNumPoints = 100;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            // Instantiate 100 objects to the right of the current object
            [Vector3](Vector3.html)[] points = new [Vector3](Vector3.html)[kNumPoints];
            for (int pointNum = 0; pointNum < kNumPoints; pointNum++)
            {
                points[pointNum] = [Vector3.right](Vector3-right.html) * pointNum;
            }
            [Vector3](Vector3.html)[] transformedPoints = new [Vector3](Vector3.html)[kNumPoints];
            transform.TransformPoints(points, transformedPoints);
            for (int pointNum = 0; pointNum < kNumPoints; pointNum++)
            {
                Instantiate(someObject, transformedPoints[pointNum], someObject.transform.rotation);
            }
        }
    }
