### Description

Values for the raster state.

Use this with [RenderStateBlock](Rendering.RenderStateBlock.html) and
ScriptableRenderContext.DrawRenderers to override the GPU's render state.  
  
Corresponds to the `Conservative`, `Cull`, `ZClip`, and `Offset` commands in
[ShaderLab](../Manual/SL-Reference.html).  
  
Additional resources: [RenderStateBlock](Rendering.RenderStateBlock.html),
[[ScriptableRenderContext.DrawRenderers], [ShaderLab command:
Stencil](../Manual/SL-Stencil.html).

### Static Properties

[defaultValue](Rendering.RasterState-defaultValue.html)| Default values for
the raster state.  
---|---  
  
### Properties

[conservative](Rendering.RasterState-conservative.html)| Enables conservative
rasterization. Before using check for support via
SystemInfo.supportsConservativeRaster property.  
---|---  
[cullingMode](Rendering.RasterState-cullingMode.html)| Controls which sides of
polygons should be culled (not drawn).  
[depthClip](Rendering.RasterState-depthClip.html)| Enable clipping based on
depth.  
[offsetFactor](Rendering.RasterState-offsetFactor.html)| Scales the maximum Z
slope in the GPU's depth bias setting.  
[offsetUnits](Rendering.RasterState-offsetUnits.html)| Scales the minimum
resolvable depth buffer value in the GPU's depth bias setting.  
  
### Constructors

[RasterState](Rendering.RasterState-ctor.html)| Creates a new raster state
