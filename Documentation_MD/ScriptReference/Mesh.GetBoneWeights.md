## Declaration

public void GetBoneWeights(List<BoneWeight> boneWeights);

### Parameters

boneWeights | A list of [BoneWeight](BoneWeight.html) structs to populate.  
---|---  
  
### Description

Gets the bone weights for the Mesh.

Use this method instead of [Mesh.boneWeights](Mesh-boneWeights.html) if you
want to avoid allocating a new array with every access.  
  
The [BoneWeight](BoneWeight.html) at each index corresponds to the vertex with
the same index if this mesh has bone weights defined. Otherwise the list will
be empty.  
  
Note that this property uses [BoneWeight](BoneWeight.html) structs, which
represent exactly 4 bone weights per vertex. The newer
[BoneWeight1](BoneWeight1.html) struct describes a single bone weight, and it
can be used with the associated
[Mesh.GetAllBoneWeights](Mesh.GetAllBoneWeights.html),
[Mesh.SetBoneWeights](Mesh.SetBoneWeights.html) and
[Mesh.GetBonesPerVertex](Mesh.GetBonesPerVertex.html) APIs to describe up to
255 bone weights per vertex. It is preferable to use
[BoneWeight1](BoneWeight1.html) and its associated APIs; they offer more
flexibility, and might result in small performance benefits as Unity does not
have to perform unnessary conversion operations.
