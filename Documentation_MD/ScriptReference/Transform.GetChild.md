in the Manual")

## Declaration

public [Transform](Transform.html) GetChild(int index);

### Parameters

index | Index of the child transform to return. Must be smaller than Transform.childCount.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**Transform** Transform child by index.

### Description

Returns a transform child by index.

If the transform has no child, or the index argument has a value greater than

    {
        public [Transform](Transform.html) meeple;
        public [GameObject](GameObject.html) grandChild;  
      
        public void Example()
        {
            //Assigns the transform of the first child of the Game Object this script is attached to.
            meeple = this.gameObject.transform.GetChild(0);  
      
            //Assigns the first child of the first child of the Game Object this script is attached to.
            grandChild = this.gameObject.transform.GetChild(0).GetChild(0).gameObject;
        }
