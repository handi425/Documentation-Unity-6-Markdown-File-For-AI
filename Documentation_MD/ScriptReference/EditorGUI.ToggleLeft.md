## Declaration

public static bool ToggleLeft([Rect](Rect.html) position,
[GUIContent](GUIContent.html) label, bool value, [GUIStyle](GUIStyle.html)
labelStyle = EditorStyles.label);

### Parameters

position | Rectangle on the screen to use for the toggle.  
---|---  
label | Label to display next to the toggle.  
value | The value to edit.  
labelStyle | Optional [GUIStyle](GUIStyle.html) to use for the label.  
  
### Returns

**bool** The value set by the user.

### Description

Makes a toggle field where the toggle is to the left and the label immediately
to the right of it.

[EditorGUI.ToggleLeft](EditorGUI.ToggleLeft.html) is similar to
[GUI.Toggle](GUI.Toggle.html) but respects the
[EditorGUI.showMixedValue](EditorGUI-showMixedValue.html) property and handles
keyboard focus consistent with other Editor controls.
