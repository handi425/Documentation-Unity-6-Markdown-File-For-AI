public float surfaceSlideAngle;

### Description

When the velocity movement causes a contact with a
[Collider2D](Collider2D.html), a slide maybe occur if the surface angle is
less than this angle.

Use this angle threshold to control whether slippage will occur on surface
slopes above the threshold.  
  
The angle is in degrees and is relative to the
[Rigidbody2D.SlideMovement.surfaceUp](Rigidbody2D.SlideMovement-
surfaceUp.html) vector.  
  
**NOTE:** Slide will only occur if some initial `velocity` is passed to the
[Rigidbody2D.Slide](Rigidbody2D.Slide.html) method.

[Rigidbody2D.SlideMovement.gravitySlipAngle](Rigidbody2D.SlideMovement-
gravitySlipAngle.html), [Rigidbody2D.Slide](Rigidbody2D.Slide.html) and
[SlideResults](Rigidbody2D.SlideResults.html).
