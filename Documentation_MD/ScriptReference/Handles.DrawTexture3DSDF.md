## Declaration

public static void DrawTexture3DSDF([Texture](Texture.html) texture, float
stepScale = 1.0f, float surfaceOffset = 0.0f, [Gradient](Gradient.html)
customColorRamp = null);

### Parameters

texture | The volumetric texture to draw.  
---|---  
stepScale | The number by which to multiply the ray step size. The ray step size is the distance between 2 neighboring pixels. The default value is 1.  
surfaceOffset | The intensity of the pixels at which the surface is rendered. When this value is positive, Unity will expand the rendered surface. When this value is negative, Unity will render empty space as a surface, and a surface as empty space. The default value is 0.  
customColorRamp | The custom gradient that Unity uses as a color ramp. If this is not specified, Unity uses [Google Turbo color ramp](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/08/turbo-improved-rainbow-colormap-for.html).  
  
### Description

Draws a 3D texture using Signed Distance Field rendering mode in 3D space.

This visualization mode supports only non-directional Signed Distance Fields.
