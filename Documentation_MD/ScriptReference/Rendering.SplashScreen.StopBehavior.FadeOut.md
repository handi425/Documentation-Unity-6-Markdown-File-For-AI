    {
        public SplashScreen.StopBehavior stopBehavior;

        {

        }  
      
        IEnumerator SplashScreenController()
        {
            [SplashScreen.Begin](Rendering.SplashScreen.Begin.html)();
            while (![SplashScreen.isFinished](Rendering.SplashScreen-isFinished.html))
            {
                // Fade to the background if the user presses any key during the Splash [Screen](Screen.html) rendering.
                if ([Input.anyKeyDown](Input-anyKeyDown.html))
                {
                    [SplashScreen.Stop](Rendering.SplashScreen.Stop.html)(stopBehavior);
                    break;
