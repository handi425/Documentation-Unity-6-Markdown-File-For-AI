### Description

A UnityGUI event.

Events correspond to user input (key presses, mouse actions), or are UnityGUI
layout or rendering events.  
  
For each event [OnGUI](MonoBehaviour.OnGUI.html) is called in the scripts; so
OnGUI is potentially called multiple times per frame. [Event.current](Event-
current.html) corresponds to "current" event inside OnGUI call.  
  
Additional resources: [GUI Scripting Guide](../Manual/GUIScriptingGuide.html),
[EventType](EventType.html).
