## Declaration

public static void RevertObjectOverride([Object](Object.html)
instanceComponentOrGameObject, [InteractionMode](InteractionMode.html)
action);

### Parameters

action | The interaction mode for this action.  
---|---  
instanceComponentOrGameObject | The object on the Prefab instance to revert.  
  
### Description

Reverts all overridden properties on a Prefab instance component or
GameObject.

If the specified object is a GameObject, only the overrides on the GameObject
itself are reverted; not its components or child GameObjects.  
  
After the apply action, the properties on the object on the Prefab instance
are no longer marked as overrides and now reflect the values of the Prefab
Asset.  
  
The Transform position and rotation of a root GameObject in a Prefab instance
cannot be reverted, nor can other [default
override](PrefabUtility.IsDefaultOverride.html) properties.
