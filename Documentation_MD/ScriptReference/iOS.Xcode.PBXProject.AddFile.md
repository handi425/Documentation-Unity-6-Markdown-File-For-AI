## Declaration

public string AddFile(string path, string projectPath,
[iOS.Xcode.PBXSourceTree](iOS.Xcode.PBXSourceTree.html) sourceTree);

### Parameters

path | The physical path to the file on the filesystem.  
---|---  
projectPath | The project path to the file as viewed in Xcode.  
sourceTree | The source tree the path is relative to. By default it's [PBXSourceTree.Source](iOS.Xcode.PBXSourceTree.Source.html). **Note** : [PBXSourceTree.Group](iOS.Xcode.PBXSourceTree.Group.html) tree is not supported.  
  
### Returns

**string** The GUID of the added file. You can use it later, for example, to
add the file for building to targets.

### Description

Adds a new file reference to the list of known files.

The group structure is automatically created to correspond to the project
path. To add the file to the list of files to build, pass the returned value
to [AddFileToBuild](iOS.Xcode.PBXProject.AddFileToBuild.html).

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);
    using System.IO;
    using UnityEditor.Callbacks;
    using UnityEditor.iOS.Xcode;  
      
    public class Sample_AddFile  
    {
        [PostProcessBuild]
        public static void OnPostprocessBuild([BuildTarget](BuildTarget.html) buildTarget, string pathToBuiltProject)
        {  
      
            // Stop processing if build target is not [iOS](PlayerSettings.iOS.html)
            if (buildTarget != [BuildTarget.iOS](BuildTarget.iOS.html))
                return;  
      
            // Initialize [PBXProject](iOS.Xcode.PBXProject.html)
            string projectPath = [PBXProject.GetPBXProjectPath](iOS.Xcode.PBXProject.GetPBXProjectPath.html)(pathToBuiltProject);
            [PBXProject](iOS.Xcode.PBXProject.html) pbxProject = new [PBXProject](iOS.Xcode.PBXProject.html)();
            pbxProject.ReadFromFile(projectPath);  
      
            // Specify the file path you want to add to the Xcode project
            string filePath = Path.Combine([Application.dataPath](Application-dataPath.html), "[Resources](Resources.html)/InputFile.txt");
            
            // Add the file to the '[Resources](Resources.html)' subfolder in the Xcode project
            pbxProject.AddFile(filePath, "[Resources](Resources.html)/InputFile.txt");  
      
            // Apply changes to the pbxproj file
            pbxProject.WriteToFile(projectPath);
        }
    }
