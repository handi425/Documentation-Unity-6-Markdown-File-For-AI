public float angularVelocity;

### Description

Angular velocity in degrees per second.

A Rigidbody2D can only rotate around one axis (the Z axis) so the angular
velocity is a single float value rather than a vector. Typically, the value of
this property is not set directly but rather by applying `torque` to the
rigidbody. The angular velocity will also decrease automatically under the
effect of [angularDamping](Rigidbody2D-angularDamping.html).

[AddTorque](Rigidbody2D.AddTorque.html),
[AddForceAtPosition](Rigidbody2D.AddForceAtPosition.html) &
