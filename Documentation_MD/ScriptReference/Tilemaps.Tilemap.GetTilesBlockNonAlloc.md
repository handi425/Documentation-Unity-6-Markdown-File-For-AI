## Declaration

public int GetTilesBlockNonAlloc([BoundsInt](BoundsInt.html) bounds,
TileBase[] tiles);

### Parameters

bounds | The bounds to retrieve from.  
---|---  
tiles | The array of [Tile](Tilemaps.Tile.html)s to contain the Tiles at the given bounds.  
  
### Returns

**int** Returns the number of Tiles retrieved, including null entries.

### Description

Retrieves an array of Tiles with the given bounds.

This is meant for more a performant way to get Tiles as a batch, when compared
to calling GetTile for every single position. If the size of the arrays passed
in as parameters are less than the number of Tiles within the range, the
arrays will not be resized and the results will be limited.

    
    
    // Retrieves all Tiles from an area on the [Tilemap](Tilemaps.Tilemap.html) and prints out the Tiles to console
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.Tilemaps;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public [BoundsInt](BoundsInt.html) area;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            [Tilemap](Tilemaps.Tilemap.html) tilemap = GetComponent<[Tilemap](Tilemaps.Tilemap.html)>();
            [TileBase](Tilemaps.TileBase.html)[] tileArray = new [TileBase](Tilemaps.TileBase.html)[16];
            int count = tilemap.GetTilesBlockNonAlloc(area, tileArray);
            for (int index = 0; index < count; index++)
            {
                print(tileArray[index]);
            }
        }
    }
