### Description

Use this struct to set up a sphere cast command that is performed
asynchronously during a job.

When you use this struct to schedule a batch of sphere casts, the sphere casts
are performed asynchronously and in parallel. The results of each sphere casts
are written to the results buffer. Since the results are written
asynchronously, you cannot access the results buffer until the job is
completed.  
  
The results for a command at index N in the command buffer are stored at index
N * maxHits in the results buffer.  
  
Spherecast command also allows you to control whether or not Trigger colliders
and back-face triangles generate a hit. Use
[QueryParameters](QueryParameters.html) to control hit flags.  
  
Note: Only BatchQuery.ExecuteSpherecastJob is logged into the profiler. Query
count information is not logged.  
  
Additional resources: Physics.Spherecast.
