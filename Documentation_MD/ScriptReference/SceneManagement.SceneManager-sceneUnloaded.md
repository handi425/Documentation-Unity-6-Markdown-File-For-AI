### Parameters

value | Use a subscription of either a UnityAction<[Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html)> or a method that takes a [Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html) type argument.  
---|---  
  
### Description

Add a delegate to this to get notifications when a Scene has unloaded.

Rather than being called directly this script code shows use of a delegate.
This means the [sceneUnloaded](SceneManagement.SceneManager-
sceneUnloaded.html) value is added into a list of delegates.  
  
In the script example below a method call is shown. Specifically a function
called OnSceneUnloaded is added to sceneUnloaded. SceneUnloaded is called when
the Scene it is associated with is closed. At this point SceneUnloaded should
be removed from the [sceneUnloaded](SceneManagement.SceneManager-
sceneUnloaded.html) list.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;  
      
    public class SceneLoaded1 : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public void Start()
        {
            [SceneManager.sceneUnloaded](SceneManagement.SceneManager-sceneUnloaded.html) += OnSceneUnloaded;
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("Start: SceneLoaded1");
        }  
      
        private void OnSceneUnloaded([Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html) current)
        {
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("OnSceneUnloaded: " + current);
        }  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            if ([Input.GetKey](Input.GetKey.html)("space"))
            {
                [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("Quitting Scene1");
                ChangeScene();
            }
        }  
      
        void ChangeScene()
        {
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("Changing to Scene2");  
      
            [SceneManager.LoadScene](SceneManagement.SceneManager.LoadScene.html)("Scene2");
        }  
      
        void OnDestroy()
        {
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("OnDestroy");
        }
    }
    

`SceneLoaded2` simply announces that this is the active Scene.

    
    
    using System.Collections;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class SceneLoaded2 : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public void Start()
        {
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("SceneLoaded2");
        }
    }
