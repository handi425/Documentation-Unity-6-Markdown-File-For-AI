### Description

A Task describes an instance of a version control operation.

An object of this type allows you to process operations such as
[Provider.Checkout](VersionControl.Provider.Checkout.html),
[Provider.GetLatest](VersionControl.Provider.GetLatest.html), and
[Provider.Submit](VersionControl.Provider.Submit.html). Unity creates this
item almost every time you ask [Provider](VersionControl.Provider.html) to
perform an action. Task objects, that version control operations return,
execute in the background and don't always finish immediately, use
[Task.Wait](VersionControl.Task.Wait.html) if you need to wait for them to
finish.
