### Description

The radius of the sphere measured in the object's local space.

    using UnityEngine;  
      
    //Always attach a [SphereCollider](SphereCollider.html) component to your [GameObject](GameObject.html)
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        //This declares your [SphereCollider](SphereCollider.html)
        [SphereCollider](SphereCollider.html) myCollider;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            //Assigns the attached [SphereCollider](SphereCollider.html) to myCollider
            myCollider = GetComponent<[SphereCollider](SphereCollider.html)>();
        }  
      
        void OnTriggerEnter([Collider](Collider.html) other)
        {
            //This increases the [Collider](Collider.html) radius when the [GameObject](GameObject.html) collides with a trigger [Collider](Collider.html)
            myCollider.radius += 2f;
        }
    }
