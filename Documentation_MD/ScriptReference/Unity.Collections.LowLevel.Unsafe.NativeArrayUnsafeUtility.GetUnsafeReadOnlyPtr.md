## Declaration

public static void* GetUnsafeReadOnlyPtr(NativeArray<T> nativeArray);

## Declaration

public static void* GetUnsafeReadOnlyPtr(ReadOnly<T> nativeArray);

### Parameters

nativeArray | The NativeArray to check.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**void*** The memory buffer pointer of the NativeArray.

### Description

Gets a pointer to the memory buffer of a NativeArray or NativeArray.ReadOnly.

When ENABLE_UNITY_COLLECTIONS_CHECKS is set (which is always the case in the
Editor, but never in a built player), this method checks that the
[AtomicSafetyHandle](Unity.Collections.LowLevel.Unsafe.AtomicSafetyHandle.html)
associated with the NativeContainer can be read from and isn't written to from
another thread. If it can't be read, a System.InvalidOperationException is
raised. While you can write to the returned pointer, this is generally unsafe.
When this method call succeeds, you're only guaranteed that reading from this
pointer is safe. Writing to this pointer might lead to race conditions and
crashes later during program execution.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
**Known Issue**. Please check with the Issue Tracker at
