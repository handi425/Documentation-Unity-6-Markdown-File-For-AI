### Description

Mirrors the texture once, then clamps to edge pixels.

This effectively mirrors the texture around zero UV coordinates, and repeats
edge pixel values when outside of [-1..1] range.  
  
This mode is called "mirror and clamp to edge" in graphics APIs like Vulkan,
Metal and OpenGL. This feature is not always supported when using OpenGL ES
and Vulkan graphics APIs, specifically on ARM and Qualcomm GPUs platforms.
Check [SystemInfo.supportsTextureWrapMirrorOnce](SystemInfo-
supportsTextureWrapMirrorOnce.html) to figure out whether the system is
capable..  
  
Additional resources: [Texture.wrapMode](Texture-wrapMode.html), [texture
assets](../Manual/class-TextureImporter.html),
[SystemInfo.supportsTextureWrapMirrorOnce](SystemInfo-
supportsTextureWrapMirrorOnce.html).
