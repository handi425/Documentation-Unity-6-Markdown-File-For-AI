public static [Vector3](Vector3.html) acceleration;

### Description

Last measured linear acceleration of a device in three-dimensional space.
(Read Only)

**Note: This API is part of the legacy** `Input` **class, and not recommended
for new projects. The documentation is provided here to support legacy
projects that use the old Input Manager and Input class. For new projects you
should use the newer and Input System Package**. ([read
more](../Manual/Input.html)).

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        // Move object using accelerometer
        float speed = 10.0f;  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            [Vector3](Vector3.html) dir = [Vector3.zero](Vector3-zero.html);  
      
            // we assume that device is held parallel to the ground
            // and Home button is in the right hand  
      
            // remap device acceleration axis to game coordinates:
            //  1) XY plane of the device is mapped onto XZ plane
            //  2) rotated 90 degrees around Y axis
            dir.x = -Input.acceleration.y;
            dir.z = Input.acceleration.x;  
      
            // clamp acceleration vector to unit sphere
            if (dir.sqrMagnitude > 1)
                dir.Normalize();  
      
            // Make it move 10 meters per second instead of 10 meters per frame...
            dir *= [Time.deltaTime](Time-deltaTime.html);  
      
            // Move object
            transform.Translate(dir * speed);
        }
