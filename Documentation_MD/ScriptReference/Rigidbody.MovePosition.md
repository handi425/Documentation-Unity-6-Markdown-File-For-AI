[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-Rigidbody.html "Go to Rigidbody Component
in the Manual")

## Declaration

public void MovePosition([Vector3](Vector3.html) position);

### Parameters

position | Provides the new position for the [Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html) object.  
---|---  
  
### Description

Moves the kinematic [Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html) towards `position`.

[Rigidbody.MovePosition](Rigidbody.MovePosition.html) moves a Rigidbody and
complies with the interpolation settings. When Rigidbody interpolation is
enabled, [Rigidbody.MovePosition](Rigidbody.MovePosition.html) creates a
smooth transition between frames. Unity moves a [Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html) in
each `FixedUpdate` call. The `position` occurs in world space. To teleport a
[Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html) from one position to another, use
[Rigidbody.position](Rigidbody-position.html) instead of
[MovePosition](Rigidbody.MovePosition.html).

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        [Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html) m_Rigidbody;
        public float m_Speed = 5f;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            //Fetch the [Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html) from the [GameObject](GameObject.html) with this script attached
            m_Rigidbody = GetComponent<[Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html)>();
        }  
      
        void [FixedUpdate](PlayerLoop.FixedUpdate.html)()
        {
            //Store user input as a movement vector
            [Vector3](Vector3.html) m_Input = new [Vector3](Vector3.html)([Input.GetAxis](Input.GetAxis.html)("Horizontal"), 0, [Input.GetAxis](Input.GetAxis.html)("Vertical"));  
      
            //Apply the movement vector to the current position, which is
            //multiplied by deltaTime and speed for a smooth MovePosition
            m_Rigidbody.MovePosition(transform.position + m_Input * [Time.fixedDeltaTime](Time-fixedDeltaTime.html) * m_Speed);
        }
    }
