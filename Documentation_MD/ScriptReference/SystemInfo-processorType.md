public static string processorType;

### Description

Processor name (Read Only).

Will return [SystemInfo.unsupportedIdentifier](SystemInfo-
unsupportedIdentifier.html) on platforms which don't support this property.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using [System](Rendering.VirtualTexturing.System.html);
    using System.Globalization;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            // Prints using the following format - "Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Quad CPU Q6600 @ 2.40GHz"
            print([SystemInfo.processorType](SystemInfo-processorType.html));  
      
            // Print out the architecture of the running process.
            // We can use the Environment property Is64BitProcess along with [SystemInfo.processorType](SystemInfo-processorType.html) to figure it out.
            // Do a case insensitive string check.
            if (CultureInfo.InvariantCulture.CompareInfo.IndexOf([SystemInfo.processorType](SystemInfo-processorType.html), "ARM", CompareOptions.IgnoreCase) >= 0)
            {
                if (Environment.Is64BitProcess)
                    [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("ARM64");
                else
                    [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("ARM");
            }
            else
            {
                // Must be in the x86 family.
                if (Environment.Is64BitProcess)
                    [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("x86_64");
                else
                    [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("x86");
            }
        }
    }
    

Additional resources: [SystemInfo.processorCount](SystemInfo-
processorCount.html), [SystemInfo.processorFrequency](SystemInfo-
processorFrequency.html). On Android prior to 2019.3 this property would
return the process architecture rather than the CPU name. To determine the
architecture of the running process see the example code.
