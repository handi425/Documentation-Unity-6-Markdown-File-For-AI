### Description

Exposes events that allow you to track undoable changes to objects in the
editor.

Any undoable change to any object loaded in the editor (both
[GameObject](GameObject.html) and assets such as [Material](Material.html)
object) are recorded and exposed as a stream of events. See
[ObjectChangeKind](ObjectChangeKind.html) for more information as to which
types of changes are recorded. Undoing and redoing changes also records
events. The stream of events is flushed once per frame. User interactions in
the editor may map to multiple events in the event stream.

### Events

[changesPublished](ObjectChangeEvents-changesPublished.html)| Event that is
raised once per frame if any undoable changes have been recorded.  
---|---  
  
### Delegates
