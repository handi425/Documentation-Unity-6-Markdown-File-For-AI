[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-AudioSource.html "Go to AudioSource
Component in the Manual")

public int timeSamples;

### Description

Playback position in PCM samples.

Use this to read current playback time or to seek to a new playback time in
samples, if you want more precise timing than what [time](AudioSource-
time.html) variable allows.  
  
Additional resources: [time](AudioSource-time.html) variable.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    [[RequireComponent](RequireComponent.html)(typeof([AudioSource](AudioSource.html)))]
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        [AudioSource](AudioSource.html) audioSource;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            audioSource = GetComponent<[AudioSource](AudioSource.html)>();
        }  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            if ([Input.GetKeyDown](Input.GetKeyDown.html)([KeyCode.Return](KeyCode.Return.html)))
            {
                audioSource.Stop();
                audioSource.Play();
            }
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)(audioSource.timeSamples);
        }
    }
