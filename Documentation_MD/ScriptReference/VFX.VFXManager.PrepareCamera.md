## Declaration

public static void PrepareCamera([Camera](Camera.html) cam,
[VFX.VFXCameraXRSettings](VFX.VFXCameraXRSettings.html) camXRSettings);

### Parameters

cam | The Camera to prepare for processing VFX commands.  
---|---  
camXRSettings | The XR settings that the Visual Effect Graph uses to prepare the Camera.  
  
### Description

Use this method to prepare per-Camera VFX commands for this frame.

This function updates Materials that the VisualEffect uses internally, but
does not execute any rendering commands. To execute rendering commands, call
VFXManager.ProcessCamera.  
  
Scriptable Render Pipelines (SRP) are responsible for calling this function.
The High Definition and Universal Render Pipelines implement this call.  
  
If you create your own SRP, you should typically call this function before
culling.
