## Declaration

public void ApplyCustomUI([ITerrainLayerCustomUI](ITerrainLayerCustomUI.html)
customUI, [Terrain](Terrain.html) terrain);

### Parameters

customUI | The custom UI object.  
---|---  
terrain | The Terrain object.  
  
### Description

Applies the custom UI for the Terrain Layer object.

The custom UI object is usually the same [ShaderGUI](ShaderGUI.html) object
implemented for the Terrain shader. This is because only the Terrain shader
defines how to interpret data in a TerrainLayer object. To retrieve the custom
UI object, cast the ShaderGUI object to the
[ITerrainLayerCustomUI](ITerrainLayerCustomUI.html) interface.
