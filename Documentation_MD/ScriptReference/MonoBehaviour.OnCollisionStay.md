Component in the Manual")

### Parameters

other | The Collision data associated with this collision.  
---|---  
  
### Description

OnCollisionStay is called once per frame for every Collider or Rigidbody that
touches another Collider or Rigidbody.

In contrast to OnTriggerStay, OnCollisionStay is passed the
[Collision](Collision.html) class and not a [Collider](Collider.html). The
[Collision](Collision.html) class contains information about contact points,
impact velocity etc. If you don't use collisionInfo in the function, leave out
the collisionInfo parameter as this avoids unneccessary calculations.  
  
**Note:** Collision events are only sent if one of the colliders also has a
non-kinematic rigidbody attached. Collision events will be sent to disabled
MonoBehaviours, to allow enabling Behaviours in response to collisions.  
  
Collision stay events are not sent for sleeping Rigidbodies.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void OnCollisionStay([Collision](Collision.html) collisionInfo)
        {
            // [Debug](Debug.html)-draw all contact points and normals
            foreach ([ContactPoint](ContactPoint.html) contact in collisionInfo.contacts)
            {
                [Debug.DrawRay](Debug.DrawRay.html)(contact.point, contact.normal, [Color.white](Color-white.html));
            }
        }
    }
    

OnCollisionStay can be a co-routine, simply use the yield statement in the
function.
