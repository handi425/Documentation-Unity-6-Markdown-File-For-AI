## Declaration

public static [Vector3](Vector3.html) ClampMagnitude([Vector3](Vector3.html)
vector, float maxLength);

### Description

Returns a copy of `vector` with its magnitude clamped to `maxLength`.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        // Move the object around with the arrow keys but confine it
        // to a given radius around a center point.  
      
        public [Vector3](Vector3.html) centerPt;
        public float radius;  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            // Get the new position for the object.
            [Vector3](Vector3.html) movement = new [Vector3](Vector3.html)([Input.GetAxis](Input.GetAxis.html)("Horizontal"), 0, [Input.GetAxis](Input.GetAxis.html)("Vertical"));
            [Vector3](Vector3.html) newPos = transform.position + movement;  
      
            // Calculate the distance of the new position from the center point. Keep the direction
            // the same but clamp the length to the specified radius.
            [Vector3](Vector3.html) offset = newPos - centerPt;
            transform.position = centerPt + [Vector3.ClampMagnitude](Vector3.ClampMagnitude.html)(offset, radius);
        }
    }
