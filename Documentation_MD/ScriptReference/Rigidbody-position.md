[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-Rigidbody.html "Go to Rigidbody Component
in the Manual")

public [Vector3](Vector3.html) position;

### Description

The position of the rigidbody.

[Rigidbody.position](Rigidbody-position.html) allows you to get and set the
position of a Rigidbody using the physics engine. If you change the position
of a Rigibody using [Rigidbody.position](Rigidbody-position.html), the
transform will be updated after the next physics simulation step. This is
faster than updating the position using [Transform.position](Transform-
position.html), as the latter will cause all attached Colliders to recalculate
their positions relative to the Rigidbody.  
  
If you want to continuously move a rigidbody use MovePosition instead, which
takes interpolation into account.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            GetComponent<[Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html)>().position = [Vector3.zero](Vector3-zero.html);
        }
    }
