## Declaration

public bool Contains([Vector2](Vector2.html) point);

## Declaration

public bool Contains([Vector3](Vector3.html) point);

## Declaration

public bool Contains([Vector3](Vector3.html) point, bool allowInverse);

### Parameters

point | Point to test.  
---|---  
allowInverse | Does the test allow the Rect's width and height to be negative?  
  
### Returns

**bool** True if the point lies within the specified rectangle.

### Description

Returns true if the `x` and `y` components of `point` is a point inside this
rectangle. If `allowInverse` is present and true, the width and height of the
Rect are allowed to take negative values (ie, the min value is greater than
the max), and the test will still work.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class RectExample : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            [Rect](Rect.html) rect = new [Rect](Rect.html)(0, 0, 150, 150);
            if (rect.Contains([Input.mousePosition](Input-mousePosition.html)))
                [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("Inside");
        }
    }
