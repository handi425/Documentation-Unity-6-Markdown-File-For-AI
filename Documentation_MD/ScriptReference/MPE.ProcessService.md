### Description

*This is an experimental feature.* The ProcessService allows you to start slave instance of UnityEditor, opened to the same Project as the master instance, with a specific [RoleProviderAttribute](MPE.RoleProviderAttribute.html).

The Standalone Profiler workflow uses this technology.

### Static Properties

[level](MPE.ProcessService-level.html)| The ProcessLevel of the running
instance of UnityEditor.  
---|---  
[roleName](MPE.ProcessService-roleName.html)| The role name of the running
UnityEditor process. For more information about how to register handlers for a
specific process role, see RoleProviderAttribute. For a UnityEditor process of
ProcessLevel Master, the roleName is always empty.

Closes the Profiler connection.  
---|---

[HasCapability](MPE.ProcessService.HasCapability.html)| Checks whether the
current process has a given capability.  
[IsChannelServiceStarted](MPE.ProcessService.IsChannelServiceStarted.html)|

UnityEditor on the same project as the master instance.  
[ReadParameter](MPE.ProcessService.ReadParameter.html)| A utility function to
read command line arguments passed to the current process.  
[Terminate](MPE.ProcessService.Terminate.html)| Terminates an editor process.  
  
### Events

with ProcessService.Launch exit.
