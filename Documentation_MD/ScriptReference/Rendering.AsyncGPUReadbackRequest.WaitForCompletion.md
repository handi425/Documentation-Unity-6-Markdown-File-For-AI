## Declaration

public void WaitForCompletion();

### Description

Waits for completion of the request.

Calling [AsyncGPUReadbackRequest.done](Rendering.AsyncGPUReadbackRequest-
done.html) on the request after this call, will always result in true whether
the request has completed successfully or not.
[AsyncGPUReadbackRequest.hasError](Rendering.AsyncGPUReadbackRequest-
hasError.html) can be used to find out whether this request has been
successful. Since WaitForCompletion stalls both GPU and CPU, calling this
function will result in a large performance hit and should be used sparingly.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
