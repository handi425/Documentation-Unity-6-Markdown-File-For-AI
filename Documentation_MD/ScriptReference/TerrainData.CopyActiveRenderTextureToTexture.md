## Declaration

public void CopyActiveRenderTextureToTexture(string textureName, int
textureIndex, [RectInt](RectInt.html) sourceRect,
[Vector2Int](Vector2Int.html) dest, bool allowDelayedCPUSync);

### Parameters

textureName | The name of the Terrain texture to copy into.  
---|---  
textureIndex | The index of the Terrain texture to copy into.  
sourceRect | The part of the active Render Texture to copy.  
dest | The X and Y coordinates of the Terrain texture to copy into.  
allowDelayedCPUSync | Specifies whether to allow delayed CPU synchronization of the texture.  
  
### Description

Copies the specified part of the active [RenderTexture](RenderTexture.html) to
the Terrain texture.

If the `allowDelayedCPUSync` parameter is set to `true`, and the platform
supports copying between a [RenderTexture](RenderTexture.html) and a
[Texture2D](Texture2D.html), Unity performs a GPU copy from the active
RenderTexture to the Terrain texture. This is sufficient for Terrain
rendering, but you will need to call
[SyncTexture](TerrainData.SyncTexture.html) afterward to synchronize the CPU
part of the texture.  
  
If the `allowDelayedCPUSync` parameter is set to `false`, or the platform
doesn't support copying between textures, Unity immediately reads back the
content of the active RenderTexture, and updates both the CPU and GPU parts of
the Terrain texture.  
  
Unity recommends you create the source Render Texture to copy in the format
that [Terrain.heightmapRenderTextureFormat](Terrain-
heightmapRenderTextureFormat.html) specifies, and call the HLSL function
`PackHeightmap` before you write to the source render texture. To use
`PackHeightmap`, make sure you have the include directive `#include
"UnityCG.cginc"` in your shader.
