## Declaration

public int AddEdges(List<Vector2> vertices, float edgeRadius = 0f);

### Parameters

vertices | A list of vertices that represent a continuous set of edges with each vertex connecting to the following vertex to form each edge.  
---|---  
edgeRadius | The radius extending around each edge. This is identical to [EdgeCollider2D.edgeRadius](EdgeCollider2D-edgeRadius.html).  
  
### Returns

**int** Returns the shape index the shape was added to in the
[PhysicsShapeGroup2D](PhysicsShapeGroup2D.html). This index is used as the
main reference when retrieving a shape.

### Description

Adds an edges shape
([PhysicsShapeType2D.Edges](PhysicsShapeType2D.Edges.html)) to the shape
group.

An edge shape is comprised of multiple edges (line segments) defined by all
the specified `vertices` and an `edgeRadius` that extends around the all the
edge(s).  
  
**NOTE** : Edges do not form closed a shape as they do not have any interior
even if the first and last vertex were to overlap therefore the logical
interior is not detectable by physics queries etc.

## Declaration

public int AddEdges(List<Vector2> vertices, bool useAdjacentStart, bool
useAdjacentEnd, [Vector2](Vector2.html) adjacentStart, [Vector2](Vector2.html)
adjacentEnd, float edgeRadius = 0f);

### Parameters

vertices | A list of vertices that represent a continuous set of edges with each vertex connecting to the following vertex to form each edge.  
---|---  
edgeRadius | The radius extending around each edge. This is identical to [EdgeCollider2D.edgeRadius](EdgeCollider2D-edgeRadius.html).  
useAdjacentStart | When the value is true, the `adjacentStart` argument is used. When the value is false, the `adjacentStart` argument is not used.  
useAdjacentEnd | When the value is true, the `adjacentEnd` argument is used. When the value is false, the `adjacentEnd` argument is not used.  
adjacentStart | Defines the position of a virtual point adjacent to the start vertex of an edge shape.  
adjacentEnd | Defines the position of a virtual point adjacent to the end vertex of an edge shape.  
  
### Returns

**int** Returns the shape index the shape was added to in the
[PhysicsShapeGroup2D](PhysicsShapeGroup2D.html). This index is used as the
main reference when retrieving a shape.

### Description

Adds an edge shape ([PhysicsShapeType2D.Edges](PhysicsShapeType2D.Edges.html))
to the shape group supporting adjacent start and end vertices.

An edges shape is comprised of multiple edges (line segments) defined by all
the specified `vertices` and an `edgeRadius` that extends around the all the
edge(s).  
  
**NOTE** : Edges do not form closed a shape as they do not have any interior
even if the first and last vertex were to overlap therefore the logical
interior is not detectable by physics queries etc.
