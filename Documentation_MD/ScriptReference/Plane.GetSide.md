            {
                // If the ball is over goal line 1 then it's a goal for team 1...
                if (goalLine1.GetSide(ballPos))
                {
                    return 1;
                }
                // ...else if the ball is over goal line 2 then it's a goal for team 2.
                else if (goalLine2.GetSide(ballPos))
                {
                    return 2;
                }
            }  
      
            // Otherwise, it isn't a goal for either team.
