## Declaration

public [ColliderDistance2D](ColliderDistance2D.html)
Distance([Collider2D](Collider2D.html) collider);

### Parameters

collider | A collider used to calculate the minimum separation against this collider.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**ColliderDistance2D** The minimum separation of `collider` and this collider.

### Description

Calculates the minimum separation of this collider against another collider.

A valid `collider` must be provided for the
[ColliderDistance2D](ColliderDistance2D.html) to be valid. If there are any
problems with `collider` or this [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) such as they
are disabled or do not contain any collision shapes then the separation will
be invalid as indicated by
[ColliderDistance2D.isValid](ColliderDistance2D-isValid.html).

## Declaration

public [ColliderDistance2D](ColliderDistance2D.html)
Distance([Vector2](Vector2.html) thisPosition, float thisAngle,
[Collider2D](Collider2D.html) collider, [Vector2](Vector2.html) position,
float angle);

### Parameters

thisPosition | The position to use for this Collider.  
---|---  
thisAngle | The rotation to use for this Collider.  
collider | A collider used to calculate the minimum separation against this Collider.  
position | The position to use for the specified `collider`.  
angle | The rotation to use for the specified `collider`.  
  
### Returns

**ColliderDistance2D** The minimum separation of `collider` and this collider.

### Description

A valid `collider` must be provided for the
[ColliderDistance2D](ColliderDistance2D.html) to be valid. If there are any
problems with `collider` or this [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) such as they
are disabled or do not contain any collision shapes then the separation will
be invalid as indicated by
[ColliderDistance2D.isValid](ColliderDistance2D-isValid.html).

A valid `collider` must be provided for the

problems with `collider` or this [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) such as they

**NOTE** : The positions and angles used here represent the position of the
[Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) the respective [Collider2D](Collider2D.html)
is attached to. If the [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) is offset from the center
of mass then the [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) will use the same offset. This
can be confusing so it is recommened that only [Collider2D](Collider2D.html)
that align with the center of mass are used. If not then you must take this
into account. If the [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) is not attached to a
[Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html), this call cannot be used and will result in a
warning.
