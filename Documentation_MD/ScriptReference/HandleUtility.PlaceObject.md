## Declaration

public static bool PlaceObject([Vector2](Vector2.html) guiPosition, out
[Vector3](Vector3.html) position, out [Vector3](Vector3.html) normal);

### Parameters

guiPosition | The GUI position in the [SceneView](SceneView.html). You can pass Event.current.mousePosition to this parameter in most cases.  
---|---  
position | Returns the nearest intersected point to a ray cast from the mouse position into the scene.  
normal | Returns the normal of the nearest intersected point to a ray cast from the mouse position into the scene.  
  
### Returns

**bool** Returns true if the raycast intersected something in the scene;
otherwise, false.

### Description

Casts a ray against the loaded scenes and returns the nearest intersected
point on a collider.

Use this method to match the behavior of drag and drop in the
[SceneView](SceneView.html).  
  
[PlaceObject](HandleUtility.PlaceObject.html) also queries any delegates
registered to [placeObjectCustomPasses](HandleUtility-
placeObjectCustomPasses.html) when determining the nearest point.
