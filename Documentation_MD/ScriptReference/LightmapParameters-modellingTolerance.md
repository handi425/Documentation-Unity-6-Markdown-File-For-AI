public float modellingTolerance;

### Description

Maximum size of gaps that can be ignored for GI (multiplier on pixel size).

Can be used to alleviate issues when objects are close together and the gap
between the objects should not be used in the calculation of GI. In some cases
having an object near a surface may cause a dark halo on the surface around
the perimeter of the object because there is a small gap between the object
and the surface where nearly no light will enter causing a very dark pixel.
These dark pixels can look bad if they are partially visible and not
completely obscured by the object. Increasing the modelling tolerance will
make the GI calculation ignore the parts of the pixel that are very near
another surface. The value is multiplier on the pixel size. If you want to
ignore 5cm gaps with a real-time resolution of 2 texels per meter you would
need a modelling tolerance of 0.01.
