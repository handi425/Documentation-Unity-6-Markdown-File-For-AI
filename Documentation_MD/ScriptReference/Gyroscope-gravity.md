public [Vector3](Vector3.html) gravity;

### Description

Returns the gravity acceleration vector expressed in the device's reference
frame.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        float movementScale;  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            // A "spirit level" - the dot product of the gravity and the Y axis (ie, [Vector3.up](Vector3-up.html))
            // is a measure of how far the device is from level on that axis (it will be zero
            // if the device is perfectly level). This value can be used to position an object
            // to act as the "bubble".
            [Vector3](Vector3.html) pos = transform.position;
            pos.y = [Vector3.Dot](Vector3.Dot.html)(Input.gyro.gravity, [Vector3.up](Vector3-up.html)) * movementScale;
            transform.position = pos;
        }
    }
