### Description

Represents an axis aligned bounding box with all values as integers.

An axis-aligned bounding box, or AABB for short, is a box aligned with
coordinate axes and fully enclosing some object. As the box is never rotated
with respect to the axes, it can be defined by [min](BoundsInt-min.html) and
[max](BoundsInt-max.html) points.

### Properties

[allPositionsWithin](BoundsInt-allPositionsWithin.html)| A
BoundsInt.PositionCollection that contains all positions within the BoundsInt.  
---|---  
[center](BoundsInt-center.html)| The center of the bounding box.  
[max](BoundsInt-max.html)| The maximal point of the box.  
[min](BoundsInt-min.html)| The minimal point of the box.  
[position](BoundsInt-position.html)| The position of the bounding box.  
[size](BoundsInt-size.html)| The total size of the box.  
[x](BoundsInt-x.html)| X value of the minimal point of the box.  
[xMax](BoundsInt-xMax.html)| The maximal x point of the box.  
[xMin](BoundsInt-xMin.html)| The minimal x point of the box.  
[y](BoundsInt-y.html)| Y value of the minimal point of the box.  
[yMax](BoundsInt-yMax.html)| The maximal y point of the box.  
[yMin](BoundsInt-yMin.html)| The minimal y point of the box.  
[z](BoundsInt-z.html)| Z value of the minimal point of the box.  
[zMax](BoundsInt-zMax.html)| The maximal z point of the box.  
[zMin](BoundsInt-zMin.html)| The minimal z point of the box.  
  
### Public Methods

[ClampToBounds](BoundsInt.ClampToBounds.html)| Clamps the position and size of
this bounding box to the given bounds.  
---|---  
[Contains](BoundsInt.Contains.html)| Is point contained in the bounding box?  
[SetMinMax](BoundsInt.SetMinMax.html)| Sets the bounds to the min and max
value of the box.  
[ToString](BoundsInt.ToString.html)| Returns a formatted string for the
bounds.
