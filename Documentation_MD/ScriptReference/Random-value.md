[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-random.html "Go to Random Component in the
Manual")

public static float value;

### Description

Returns a random float within [0.0..1.0] (range is inclusive) (Read Only).

**Important** : Both the lower and upper bounds are **inclusive**. Any given
float value between 0.0 and 1.0, _including both 0.0 and 1.0_ , will appear on
average approximately once every ten million random samples.  
  
See [Random](Random.html) for more examples of how `UnityEngine.Random` may be
different from other random number generators.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            [Color](Color.html) randomColor = RandomColor();
        }  
      
        // Generate a random color value.
        [Color](Color.html) RandomColor()
        {
            // A different random value is used for each color component (if
            // the same is used for R, G and B, a shade of grey is produced).
            return new [Color](Color.html)([Random.value](Random-value.html), [Random.value](Random-value.html), [Random.value](Random-value.html));
        }
    }
