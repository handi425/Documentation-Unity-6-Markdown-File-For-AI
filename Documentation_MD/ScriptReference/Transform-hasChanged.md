in the Manual")

public bool hasChanged;

### Description

Has the transform changed since the last time the flag was set to 'false'?

A change to the transform can be anything that can cause its matrix to be
recalculated: any adjustment to its position, rotation or scale. Note that
operations which can change the transform will not actually check if the old
and new value are different before setting this flag. So setting, for
instance, transform.position will always set hasChanged on the transform,
regardless of there being any actual change.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            if (transform.hasChanged)
            {
                print("The transform has changed!");
                transform.hasChanged = false;
            }
        }
    }
