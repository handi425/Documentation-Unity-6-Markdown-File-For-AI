### Description

The intended usage of a GraphicsBuffer.

Provide the intended usage (mode) when creating a GraphicsBuffer.  
  
[GraphicsBuffer.UsageFlags.None](GraphicsBuffer.UsageFlags.None.html) lets you
update the data using [GraphicsBuffer.SetData](GraphicsBuffer.SetData.html).  
  
[GraphicsBuffer.UsageFlags.LockBufferForWrite](GraphicsBuffer.UsageFlags.LockBufferForWrite.html)
lets you write to the buffer using
[GraphicsBuffer.LockBufferForWrite](GraphicsBuffer.LockBufferForWrite.html).
See
[GraphicsBuffer.UsageFlags.LockBufferForWrite](GraphicsBuffer.UsageFlags.LockBufferForWrite.html)
for information on limitations and considerations to take when using this
mode.  
  
Additional resources: [GraphicsBuffer](GraphicsBuffer.html) class,
[GraphicsBuffer constructor](GraphicsBuffer-ctor.html)

### Properties

[None](GraphicsBuffer.UsageFlags.None.html)| Sets the update mode flags to
None. This is the default update mode.  
---|---  
[LockBufferForWrite](GraphicsBuffer.UsageFlags.LockBufferForWrite.html)|
Enable the LockBufferForWrite and UnlockBufferAfterWrite methods on the
GraphicsBuffer. CAUTION: when using this flag, ensure that you do not
introduce memory read/write hazards.
