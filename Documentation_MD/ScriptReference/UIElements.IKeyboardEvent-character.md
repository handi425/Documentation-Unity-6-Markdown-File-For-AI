public char character;

### Description

Gets the character entered.

This is the character entered when a key is pressed, taking into account the
current keyboard layout. For example, pressing the "A" key causes this
property to return either "a" or "A", depending on whether the Shift key is
pressed at the time. The Shift key itself does not produce a character. When
pressed, it returns an empty string.
