public int flipbookColumns;

### Description

The number of columns in the source image for a Texture2DArray or Texture3D.

When Unity imports a texture with a [textureShape](TextureImporterSettings-
textureShape.html) of
[TextureImporterShape.Texture2DArray](TextureImporterShape.Texture2DArray.html)
or [TextureImporterShape.Texture3D](TextureImporterShape.Texture3D.html), it
divides the source image into cells. Each cell is imported into its own layer
or depth slice of the resulting texture. You can set the number of cells using
the [flipbookColumns](TextureImporterSettings-flipbookColumns.html) and
[flipbookRows](TextureImporterSettings-flipbookRows.html) settings.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
