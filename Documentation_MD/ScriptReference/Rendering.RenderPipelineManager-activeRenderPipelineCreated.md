### Description

Delegate that you can use to invoke custom code right after
[RenderPipelineManager.currentPipeline](Rendering.RenderPipelineManager-
currentPipeline.html) is created.

Unity does not switch the render pipeline immediately when you set
[GraphicsSettings.currentRenderPipeline](Rendering.GraphicsSettings-
currentRenderPipeline.html) or
[QualitySettings.renderPipeline](QualitySettings-renderPipeline.html). Unity
only instantiate a new `RenderPipeline` instance the first time any
[Camera](Camera.html) renders after you set a new `RenderPipelineAsset`. You
can subscribe to this event to know that `RenderPipeline` is created. To
access the current pipeline object you can rely on
[RenderPipelineManager.currentPipeline](Rendering.RenderPipelineManager-
currentPipeline.html) which will point to the newly created `RenderPipeline`.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.Rendering;  
      
    
    public class CurrentRenderPipelineCreatedExample : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            [RenderPipelineManager.activeRenderPipelineCreated](Rendering.RenderPipelineManager-activeRenderPipelineCreated.html) += RenderPipelineManager_activeRenderPipelineCreated;
        }  
      
        private void OnDestroy()
        {
            [RenderPipelineManager.activeRenderPipelineCreated](Rendering.RenderPipelineManager-activeRenderPipelineCreated.html) -= RenderPipelineManager_activeRenderPipelineCreated;
        }  
      
        private void RenderPipelineManager_activeRenderPipelineCreated()
        {
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)($"Render Pipeline {RenderPipelineManager.currentPipeline.GetType().Name} is created.");
        }
    }
