ArticulationBody Component in the Manual")

## Declaration

public void SetDriveTargets(List<float> targets);

### Parameters

targets | Supplied list of floats used to set the joint drive targets.   
---|---  
  
### Description

Assigns articulation body joint drive targets for the entire hierarchy of
bodies.

This sets joint drive targets in the reduced coordinate space for the entire
articulation hierarchy starting from root using the supplied list of floats.
Every joint drive target DOF is represented by one float value, however
depending on the type of the articulation joint there might be zero, one or 3
DOFs per joint. The exact location of the data to be set in the supplied list
for the specific articulation body can be found by calling
[ArticulationBody.GetDofStartIndices](ArticulationBody.GetDofStartIndices.html)
and indexing returned dofStartIndices list by the particular body index via
[ArticulationBody.index](ArticulationBody-index.html). Number of degrees of
freedom(DOF) for the articulation body can be found using
[ArticulationBody.dofCount](ArticulationBody-dofCount.html).  
  
Units of measurement - meters for linear and radians for angular motion.
