## Declaration

public static [SceneManagement.Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html)
GetSceneByName(string name);

### Parameters

name | Name of Scene to find.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**Scene** A reference to the Scene, if valid. If not, an invalid Scene is
returned.

### Description

Searches through the Scenes loaded for a Scene with the given name.

The name has to be without the .unity extension. The name can be the last part
of the name as displayed in the BuildSettings window in which case the first
Scene that matches will be returned. The name can also be the path as
displayed in the Build Settings (still without the .unity extension), in which
case only the exact match will be returned. This is case insensitive.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
**Known Issue**. Please check with the Issue Tracker at
