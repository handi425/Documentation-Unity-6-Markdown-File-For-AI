## Declaration

public static void MoveGameObjectToScene([GameObject](GameObject.html) go,
[SceneManagement.Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html) scene);

### Parameters

go | GameObject to move.  
---|---  
scene | Scene to move into.  
  
### Description

Move a GameObject from its current Scene to a new Scene.

You can only move root GameObjects from one Scene to another. This means the
GameObject to move must not be a child of any other GameObject in its Scene.
This only works on GameObjects being moved to a Scene that is already loaded
(additive). If you want to load single Scenes, make sure to use
DontDestroyOnLoad on the GameObject you would like to move to a new Scene,
otherwise Unity deletes it when it loads a new Scene.

    
    
    // This script moves the [GameObject](GameObject.html) you attach in the Inspector to a [Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html) you specify in the Inspector.
    // Attach this script to an empty [GameObject](GameObject.html).
    // Click on the [GameObject](GameObject.html), go to its Inspector and type the name of the [Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html) you would like to load in the [Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html) field.
    // Attach the [GameObject](GameObject.html) you would like to move to a new [Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html) in the "My Game Object" field  
      
    // Make sure your Scenes are in your build (**File** >**Build Settings**).

    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        // Type in the name of the [Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html) you would like to load in the Inspector
        public string m_Scene;  
      
        // Assign your [GameObject](GameObject.html) you want to move [Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html) in the Inspector
        public [GameObject](GameObject.html) m_MyGameObject;  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            // Press the space key to add the [Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html) additively and move the [GameObject](GameObject.html) to that [Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html)
            if ([Input.GetKeyDown](Input.GetKeyDown.html)([KeyCode.Space](KeyCode.Space.html)))
            {

            [Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html) currentScene = [SceneManager.GetActiveScene](SceneManagement.SceneManager.GetActiveScene.html)();  
      
            // The [Application](Application.html) loads the [Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html) in the background at the same time as the current [Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html).
            [AsyncOperation](AsyncOperation.html) asyncLoad = [SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync](SceneManagement.SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync.html)(m_Scene, [LoadSceneMode.Additive](SceneManagement.LoadSceneMode.Additive.html));  
      
            // Wait until the last operation fully loads to return anything
            while (!asyncLoad.isDone)
            {
                yield return null;
            }  
      
            // Move the [GameObject](GameObject.html) (you attach this in the Inspector) to the newly loaded [Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html)
            [SceneManager.MoveGameObjectToScene](SceneManagement.SceneManager.MoveGameObjectToScene.html)(m_MyGameObject, [SceneManager.GetSceneByName](SceneManagement.SceneManager.GetSceneByName.html)(m_Scene));
            // Unload the previous [Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html)
            [SceneManager.UnloadSceneAsync](SceneManagement.SceneManager.UnloadSceneAsync.html)(currentScene);
