## Declaration

public void SetIndexBufferParams(int indexCount,
[Rendering.IndexFormat](Rendering.IndexFormat.html) format);

### Parameters

indexCount | Size of index buffer.  
---|---  
format | Format of the indices.  
  
### Description

Sets the index buffer size and format.

Note: This method is designed for advanced users aiming for maximum
performance because it operates on the underlying mesh data structures that
primarily work on raw index buffers, vertex buffers and mesh subset data.
Using this method, Unity performs very little data validation, so you must
ensure your data is valid.  
  
In particular, you must ensure that the index buffer does not contain out-of-
bounds indices, and that the SubMesh index range and bounds are updated via
[SetSubMesh](Mesh.SetSubMesh.html).  
  
For information about the difference between the simpler and more advanced
methods of assigning data to a Mesh from script, see the notes on the
[Mesh](Mesh.html) page.  
  
General usage pattern is:

    
    
    var mesh = new [Mesh](Mesh.html)();  
      
    // setup vertex buffer data
    mesh.vertices = ...;  
      
    // set index buffer
    mesh.SetIndexBufferParams(...);
    mesh.SetIndexBufferData(...);  
      
    // setup information about mesh subsets
    mesh.subMeshCount = ...;
    mesh.SetSubMesh(index, ...);

When you change the index buffer size or format, the [subMeshCount](Mesh-
subMeshCount.html) reverts to one, and the index buffer data is uninitialized.
To set values, use [SetIndexBufferData](Mesh.SetIndexBufferData.html).  
  
Note that changing [subMeshCount](Mesh-subMeshCount.html) to a smaller value
than it was previously resizes the index buffer to be smaller. The new index
buffer size is set to
[SubMeshDescriptor.indexStart](Rendering.SubMeshDescriptor-indexStart.html) of
the first removed sub-mesh.  
  
If the index buffer size exceeds the maximum buffer size that the device
supports, the method raises an exception. For more information, see
[SystemInfo.maxGraphicsBufferSize](SystemInfo-maxGraphicsBufferSize.html).
