## Declaration

public static Plane[] CalculateFrustumPlanes([Camera](Camera.html) camera);

### Parameters

camera | The camera with the view frustum that you want to calculate planes from.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**Plane[]** The planes that form the camera's view frustum.

### Description

Calculates frustum planes.

This function takes the given camera's view frustum and returns six planes
that form it.  
  
Ordering: [0] = Left, [1] = Right, [2] = Down, [3] = Up, [4] = Near, [5] = Far

## Declaration

public static void CalculateFrustumPlanes([Camera](Camera.html) camera,
Plane[] planes);

### Parameters

camera | The camera with the view frustum that you want to calculate planes from.  
---|---  
planes | An array of 6 Planes that will be overwritten with the calculated plane values.  
  
### Description

Calculates frustum planes.

This function takes the given camera's view frustum and returns six planes
that form it. This is similar to the previous overload, except that instead of
allocating a new array for the calculated planes, the function will use an
array that you have provided. This array must always be exactly of length 6.  
  
Ordering: [0] = Left, [1] = Right, [2] = Down, [3] = Up, [4] = Near, [5] = Far

## Declaration

public static Plane[] CalculateFrustumPlanes([Matrix4x4](Matrix4x4.html)
worldToProjectionMatrix);

### Parameters

worldToProjectionMatrix | A matrix that transforms from world space to projection space, from which the planes will be calculated.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**Plane[]** The planes that enclose the projection space described by the
matrix.

### Description

Calculates frustum planes.

This function returns six planes of a frustum defined by the given view &
projection matrix.
