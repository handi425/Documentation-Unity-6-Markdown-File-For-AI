public float flowMagnitude;

### Description

The magnitude of the force used to similate fluid flow.

Fluid flow can be defined to move in any direction with a specific magnitude
and a random variation on that magnitude.  
  
This property defines the size of the force to be applied in the direction
defined by [flowAngle](BuoyancyEffector2D-flowAngle.html). This magnitude can
be randomly varied by using
[flowVariation](BuoyancyEffector2D-flowVariation.html).  
  
The flow forces are applied to the center of any submerged region of a
[Collider2D](Collider2D.html) so it will not produce any torque (rotation) if
the [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) is fully submerged (fully below the
[surfaceLevel](BuoyancyEffector2D-surfaceLevel.html)) but will produce torque
if the [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) is partially submerged (overlapping the
[surfaceLevel](BuoyancyEffector2D-surfaceLevel.html)).  
  
Additional resources: [flowAngle](BuoyancyEffector2D-flowAngle.html),
[flowVariation](BuoyancyEffector2D-flowVariation.html).
