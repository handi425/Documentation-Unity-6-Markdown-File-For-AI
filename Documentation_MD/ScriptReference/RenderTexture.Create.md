Component in the Manual")

## Declaration

public bool Create();

### Returns

**bool** True if the texture is created, else false.

### Description

Actually creates the RenderTexture.

RenderTexture constructor does not actually create the hardware texture; by
default the texture is created the first time it is set
[active](RenderTexture-active.html). Calling `Create` lets you create it up
front. `Create` does nothing if the texture is already created.  
  
The initial contents of a newly created render texture are undefined. On some
platforms and APIs the contents will default to black, but you shouldn't
depend on this. You can use
[LoadStoreActionDebugModeSettings](Rendering.LoadStoreActionDebugModeSettings.html)
to highlight undefined areas of the display, to help you debug rendering
problems on mobile platforms.  
  
Additional resources: [Release](RenderTexture.Release.html),
[IsCreated](RenderTexture.IsCreated.html) functions.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public [RenderTexture](RenderTexture.html) rt;  
      
        void  Start()
        {
            rt = new [RenderTexture](RenderTexture.html)(256, 256, 16, [RenderTextureFormat.ARGB32](RenderTextureFormat.ARGB32.html));
            rt.Create();  
      
            // Add code here to work on the render texture  
      
            // Release the hardware resources used by the render texture
            rt.Release();
        }
    }
