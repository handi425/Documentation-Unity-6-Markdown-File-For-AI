## Declaration

public static void SetGlobalFloat(string name, float value);

## Declaration

public static void SetGlobalFloat(int nameID, float value);

### Parameters

nameID | The name ID of the property retrieved by [Shader.PropertyToID](Shader.PropertyToID.html).  
---|---  
name | The name of the property.  
  
### Description

Sets a global float property for all shaders.

Global properties are used if a shader needs them but the material does not
have them defined (for example, if the shader does not expose them in
`Properties` block).  
  
Usually this is used if you have a set of custom shaders that all use the same
"global" float (for example, density of some custom fog type). Then you can
set the global property from script and don't have to setup the same float in
all materials.  
  
Additional resources: [SetGlobalColor](Shader.SetGlobalColor.html),
[SetGlobalTexture](Shader.SetGlobalTexture.html); [Material](Material.html)
class, [ShaderLab documentation](../Manual/Shaders.html).  
  
The following example sets the global float property `_MyFloat` to `1` in all
shaders.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class SetGlobalFloatExample : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            [Shader.SetGlobalFloat](Shader.SetGlobalFloat.html)("_MyFloat", 1.0f);
        }
    }
