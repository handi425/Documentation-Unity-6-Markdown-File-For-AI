## Declaration

public void WriteBuffer(BufferSlice<T> dst, NativeArray<T> src);

## Declaration

public void WriteBuffer(BufferSlice<T> dst, NativeArray<T> src,
[LightTransport.EventID](LightTransport.EventID.html) id);

### Parameters

dst | The buffer slice to write to.  
---|---  
src | The array in the CPU memory that should be written to the buffer. The array must remain valid until the write operation is complete.  
id | The ID of the event to use to track completion of the write.  
  
### Description

Write data into the memory buffer allocated by the context.

This is an asynchronous operation. Pass an
[EventID](LightTransport.EventID.html) created with
[IDeviceContext.CreateEvent](LightTransport.IDeviceContext.CreateEvent.html)
to track the completion status, if desired. The
[IDeviceContext.WriteBuffer](LightTransport.IDeviceContext.WriteBuffer.html)
method returns immediately after enqueuing the command in the context.  
  
**Note:** [EventID](LightTransport.EventID.html) is single-use. Once an
[EventID](LightTransport.EventID.html) has been passed to this function, it
may not be passed to subsequent
[IDeviceContext.WriteBuffer](LightTransport.IDeviceContext.WriteBuffer.html)
or [IDeviceContext.ReadBuffer](LightTransport.IDeviceContext.ReadBuffer.html)
calls. Doing so will result in undefined behavior.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
