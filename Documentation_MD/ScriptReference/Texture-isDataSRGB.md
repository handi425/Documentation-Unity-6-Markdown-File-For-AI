public bool isDataSRGB;

### Description

Returns `true` if the texture pixel data is in sRGB color space (Read Only).

This property describes whether the texture pixel data on disk, CPU memory,
and GPU memory is in sRGB color space. Use
[GraphicsFormatUtility.IsSRGBFormat](Experimental.Rendering.GraphicsFormatUtility.IsSRGBFormat.html)
with [Texture.graphicsFormat](Texture-graphicsFormat.html) to check the GPU
texture color space, which determines how Unity samples the pixel data on the
GPU.  
  
Additional resources: [Linear and Gamma
rendering](../Manual/LinearLighting.html).
