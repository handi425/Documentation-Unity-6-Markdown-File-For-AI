## Declaration

public static Object InstantiatePrefab([Object](Object.html)
assetComponentOrGameObject);

## Declaration

public static Object InstantiatePrefab([Object](Object.html)
assetComponentOrGameObject,
[SceneManagement.Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html) destinationScene);

### Parameters

assetComponentOrGameObject | Prefab Asset to instantiate.  
---|---  
destinationScene | Scene to instantiate the Prefab in.  
  
### Returns

**Object** The GameObject at the root of the Prefab.

### Description

Instantiates the given Prefab in a given Scene.

This is similar to Instantiate but creates a Prefab connection to the Prefab.
If you do not specify a Scene handle, the Prefab is instantiated in the active
Scene.  
  
**Note:** You should not instantiate Prefabs from the
[OnValidate()](MonoBehaviour.OnValidate.html) or
[Awake()](MonoBehaviour.Awake.html) method. This is because the order in which
GameObjects become awake is not deterministic, and therefore can result in
unexpected behaviour. If you try this, Unity will generate a warning reading
"SendMessage cannot be called during Awake, CheckConsistency, or OnValidate".

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);  
      
    public class Example
    {
        [[MenuItem](MenuItem.html)("Examples/Instantiate Selected")]
        static void InstantiatePrefab()
        {
            [Selection.activeObject](Selection-activeObject.html) = [PrefabUtility.InstantiatePrefab](PrefabUtility.InstantiatePrefab.html)([Selection.activeObject](Selection-activeObject.html) as [GameObject](GameObject.html));
        }  
      
        [[MenuItem](MenuItem.html)("Examples/Instantiate Selected", true)]
        static bool ValidateInstantiatePrefab()
        {
            [GameObject](GameObject.html) go = [Selection.activeObject](Selection-activeObject.html) as [GameObject](GameObject.html);
            if (go == null)
                return false;  
      
            return [PrefabUtility.IsPartOfPrefabAsset](PrefabUtility.IsPartOfPrefabAsset.html)(go);
        }
    }
