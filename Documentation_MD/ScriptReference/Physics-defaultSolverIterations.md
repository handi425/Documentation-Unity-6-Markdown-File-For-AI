public static int defaultSolverIterations;

### Description

The defaultSolverIterations determines how accurately Rigidbody joints and
collision contacts are resolved. (default 6). Must be positive.

If you are having trouble with connected Rigidbodies oscillating and behaving
erratically setting a higher solver iteration count may improve their
stability (but is slower).  
  
This value is usually changed in `Edit->Project Settings->Physics` inspector
instead of from scripts.  
  
**Note:** Changing the defaultSolverIterations does not affect already created
Rigidbodies. To change an existing Rigidbody please use
[Rigidbody.solverIterations](Rigidbody-solverIterations.html).  
  
Additional resources: [Physics.defaultSolverVelocityIterations](Physics-
defaultSolverVelocityIterations.html).

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            [Physics.defaultSolverIterations](Physics-defaultSolverIterations.html) = 10;
        }
    }
