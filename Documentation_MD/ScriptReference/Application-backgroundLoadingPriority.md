public static [ThreadPriority](ThreadPriority.html) backgroundLoadingPriority;

### Description

Priority of background loading thread.

Lets you control how long it takes to load data asynchronously vs performance
impact on the game while loading in the background.  
  
Asynchronous load functions that load objects
([Resources.LoadAsync](Resources.LoadAsync.html),
[AssetBundle.LoadAssetAsync](AssetBundle.LoadAssetAsync.html),
AssetBundle.LoadAllAssetAsync), scenes
([SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync](SceneManagement.SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync.html))
do data read and deserialization on a separate background loading thread and
object integration on a main thread. _Integration_ depends on an object type
and for textures, meshes means uploading data to the GPU, audio clips prepare
data for playing.  
  
To avoid hiccups we limit _integration_ time on a main thread depending on
[backgroundLoadingPriority](Application-backgroundLoadingPriority.html) value:  
\- [ThreadPriority.Low](ThreadPriority.Low.html) \- 2ms  
\- [ThreadPriority.BelowNormal](ThreadPriority.BelowNormal.html) \- 4ms  
\- [ThreadPriority.Normal](ThreadPriority.Normal.html) \- 10ms  
\- [ThreadPriority.High](ThreadPriority.High.html) \- 50ms  
This is a maximum time all asynchronous operations can spend within a single
frame on a main thread.  
  
Background loading thread uses [backgroundLoadingPriority](Application-
backgroundLoadingPriority.html) directly.  
  
The Profiler marker **Application.Integrate Assets in Background** lets you
optimize background loading.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class ExampleScript : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Example1()
        {
            // Load as much data as possible, as a result frame rate will drop.
            // Good for fast loading when showing progress bars.  
      
            [Application.backgroundLoadingPriority](Application-backgroundLoadingPriority.html) = [ThreadPriority.High](ThreadPriority.High.html);
        }  
      
        void Example2()
        {
            // Load data very slowly and try not to affect performance of the game.
            // Good for loading in the background while the game is playing.  
      
            [Application.backgroundLoadingPriority](Application-backgroundLoadingPriority.html) = [ThreadPriority.Low](ThreadPriority.Low.html);
        }
    }
