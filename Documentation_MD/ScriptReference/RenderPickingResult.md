### Description

This struct contains information to notify Unity the outcome of this render
picking callback.

This struct type has to be returned from the
[RenderPickingCallback](HandleUtility.RenderPickingCallback.html) to notify
Unity of:

  * The number of consecutive picking indices used during the callback
  * The [ResolvePickingCallback](HandleUtility.ResolvePickingCallback.html) delegate to invoke when the user clicks on a pixel, whose value is the `selectionId` encoded from the picking index used during the callback. Refer to [resolver](RenderPickingResult-resolver.html) for more information.
  * Alternatively, you can use a [ResolvePickingWithWorldPositionCallback](HandleUtility.ResolvePickingWithWorldPositionCallback.html) delegate if you need the world space position or the depth value for the resolve callback to work. Refer to [resolverWithWorldPos](RenderPickingResult-resolverWithWorldPos.html).

If nothing has been rendered, return
[RenderPickingResult.NoOperation](RenderPickingResult.NoOperation.html).

### Static Properties

[NoOperation](RenderPickingResult.NoOperation.html)| The constant value to be
returned from RenderPickingCallback delegates signifying that nothing has been
rendered.
