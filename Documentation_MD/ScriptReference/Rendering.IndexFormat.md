### Description

Format of the mesh index buffer data.

Index buffer can either be 16 bit (supports up to 65535 vertices in a mesh),
or 32 bit (supports up to 4 billion vertices). Default index format is 16 bit,
since that takes less memory and bandwidth.  
  
Note that GPU support for 32 bit indices is not guaranteed on all platforms;
for example Android devices with Mali-400 GPU do not support them. When using
32 bit indices on such a platform, a warning message will be logged and mesh
will not render.  
  
**Note:** the maximum possible vertex index (for example, 0xFFFF for a 16 bit
index format) might not be usable. Some graphics APIs and GPUs skip rendering
triangles with maximum vertex indices.
