### Description

The stream of animation data passed from one
[Playable](Playables.Playable.html) to another.

The AnimationStream structure is passed through the animation
[Playable](Playables.Playable.html) structures, like
[AnimationClipPlayable](Animations.AnimationClipPlayable.html) and
[AnimationMixerPlayable](Animations.AnimationMixerPlayable.html). They can be
modified when used with an
[IAnimationJobPlayable](Animations.IAnimationJobPlayable.html), like the
[AnimationScriptPlayable](Animations.AnimationScriptPlayable.html).  
  
The Playables implementing
[IAnimationJobPlayable](Animations.IAnimationJobPlayable.html) take a custom
C# job, which must implement [IAnimationJob](Animations.IAnimationJob.html),
and the AnimationStream is then passed to its callbacks during the animation
processing pass.  
  
Additional resources: [IAnimationJob](Animations.IAnimationJob.html),
[AnimationScriptPlayable](Animations.AnimationScriptPlayable.html),
[TransformStreamHandle](Animations.TransformStreamHandle.html),
[PropertyStreamHandle](Animations.PropertyStreamHandle.html),
[TransformSceneHandle](Animations.TransformSceneHandle.html), and
[PropertySceneHandle](Animations.PropertySceneHandle.html).
