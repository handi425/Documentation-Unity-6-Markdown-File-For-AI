return true if the web security emulation is enabled (Menu->Edit->Project
Settings->Editor) and false if the emulation is disabled. On all other
platforms, this returns false.  
  
This property is read-only. You can use
EditorSettings.webSecurityEmulationEnabled to set this setting in the Editor
environment.
