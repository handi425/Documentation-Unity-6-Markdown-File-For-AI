[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-Camera.html "Go to Camera Component in the
Manual")

public float orthographicSize;

### Description

Camera's half-size when in orthographic mode.

The `orthographicSize` property defines the viewing volume of an
[orthographic](Camera-orthographic.html) Camera. To edit `orthographicSize`,
you must set the Camera projection to orthographic.  
  
The height of the viewing volume is (`orthographicSize` * 2). Unity calculates
the width of the viewing volume using `orthographicSize` and the camera's
[aspect](Camera-aspect.html).  
  
Unity ignores `orthographicSize` if the camera is not orthographic. Use
[fieldOfView](Camera-fieldOfView.html) instead.  
  
Additional resources: [camera component](../Manual/class-Camera.html).

    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        //Assign this [Camera](Camera.html) in the Inspector
        public [Camera](Camera.html) m_OrthographicCamera;
        //These are the positions and dimensions of the [Camera](Camera.html) view in the Game view
        float m_ViewPositionX, m_ViewPositionY, m_ViewWidth, m_ViewHeight;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            // This sets the [Camera](Camera.html) view rectangle to be in the bottom corner of the screen
            m_ViewPositionX = 0;
            m_ViewPositionY = 0;  
      
            // This sets the [Camera](Camera.html) view rectangle to be smaller so you can compare the orthographic view of this [Camera](Camera.html) with the perspective view of the Main [Camera](Camera.html)
            m_ViewWidth = 0.4f;
            m_ViewHeight = 0.4f;  
      
            // This enables the [Camera](Camera.html) (the one that is orthographic)
            m_OrthographicCamera.enabled = true;
