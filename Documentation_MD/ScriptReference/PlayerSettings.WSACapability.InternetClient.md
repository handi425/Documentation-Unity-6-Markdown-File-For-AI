Component in the Manual")

### Description

Allows your application to receive incoming data from the internet.

This does not allow access to the local area network and does not enable the
application to act as a server. To allow your application to access the local
area network, set the
[privateNetworkClientServer](PlayerSettings.WSACapability.privateNetworkClientServer.html)
capability. To allow your application to both send and receive data, set the
[internetClientServer](PlayerSettings.WSACapability.internetClientServer.html)
capability.  
This capability gives the application access to sensitive data.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
**Known Issue**. Please check with the Issue Tracker at
