public int stride;

### Description

Size of one element in the buffer in bytes (Read Only).

Must be a multiple of 4 and less than 2048, and match the size of the buffer
type in the shader. See [Compute Shaders](../Manual/class-ComputeShader.html)
for cross-platform compatibility information.  
  
The stride you declare for your compute buffer must match the stride in the
buffer declaration of the shader you use it with. If the two stride values do
not match, Unity may crash without warning.  
  
Compute Buffers in Unity use Unit Stride. Additional resources:
[count](ComputeBuffer-count.html).
