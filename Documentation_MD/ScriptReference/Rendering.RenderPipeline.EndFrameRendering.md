## Declaration

protected static void
EndFrameRendering([Rendering.ScriptableRenderContext](Rendering.ScriptableRenderContext.html)
context, Camera[] cameras);

### Description

Calls the
[RenderPipelineManager.endFrameRendering](Rendering.RenderPipelineManager-
endFrameRendering.html) delegate.

This method is replaced by
[RenderPipeline.EndContextRendering](Rendering.RenderPipeline.EndContextRendering.html).
It is supported and documented for backwards compatibility only.  
  
If you are writing a custom Scriptable Render Pipeline, you can call this
method at the end of
[RenderPipeline.Render](Rendering.RenderPipeline.Render.html) to implement
functionality using the
[RenderPipelineManager.endFrameRendering](Rendering.RenderPipelineManager-
endFrameRendering.html) delegate.  
  
Using [RenderPipelineManager.endFrameRendering]] causes heap allocations.
Using
[RenderPipeline.EndContextRendering](Rendering.RenderPipeline.EndContextRendering.html)
and the
[RenderPipelineManager.endContextRendering](Rendering.RenderPipelineManager-
endContextRendering.html) delegate provide the same functionality, but without
heap allocations. You should therefore use
[RenderPipeline.EndContextRendering](Rendering.RenderPipeline.EndContextRendering.html)
and the
[RenderPipelineManager.endContextRendering](Rendering.RenderPipelineManager-
endContextRendering.html) delegate instead.

beginFrameRendering.html), [Unity Manual: Scriptable Render
