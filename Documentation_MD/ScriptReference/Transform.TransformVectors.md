in the Manual")

## Declaration

public void TransformVectors(Span<Vector3> vectors);

### Parameters

vectors | The vectors to be transformed, each is replaced by the transformed version.  
---|---  
  
### Description

Transforms multiple vectors from local space to world space overwriting each
original vector with the transformed version.

This operation is not affected by the position of the transform, but it is
affected by scale. The transformed vectors may have a different length to the
original versions.  
  
If you need the inverse operation to transform from world space to local space
you can use
[Transform.InverseTransformVectors](Transform.InverseTransformVectors.html)

resources:[Transform.TransformVector](Transform.TransformVector.html),

## Declaration

public void TransformVectors(ReadOnlySpan<Vector3> vectors, Span<Vector3>
transformedVectors);

### Parameters

vectors | The vectors to be transformed, these vectors are not modified by the function unless the `transformedVectors` span overlaps.  
---|---  
transformedVectors | Receives the transformed vectors, must be the same length as `vectors` otherwise an exception will be thrown. If this span overlaps `vectors` other than representing the exact same elements the behaviour is undefined.  
  
### Description

Transforms multiple vectors from local space to world space writing the
transformed versions to a possibly different location.

This operation is not affected by the position of the transform, but is is
affected by scale.The transformed vectors may have a different length to the
original versions.
