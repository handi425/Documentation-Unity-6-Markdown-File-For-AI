[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-Mesh.html "Go to Mesh Component in the
Manual")

## Declaration

public IntPtr GetNativeVertexBufferPtr(int index);

### Parameters

index | Which vertex buffer to get (some Meshes might have more than one). See [vertexBufferCount](Mesh-vertexBufferCount.html).  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**IntPtr** Pointer to the underlying graphics API vertex buffer.

### Description

Retrieves a native (underlying graphics API) pointer to the vertex buffer.

Use this function to retrieve a pointer/handle corresponding to the mesh
vertex buffer, as it is represented in the native graphics API. This can be
used to enable Mesh manipulation from [native code plugins](../Manual/native-
plugin-interface.html).  
  
Most Meshes contain only one vertex buffer, but some (such as skinned Meshes
on some platforms) might contain more than one. Use [vertexBufferCount](Mesh-
vertexBufferCount.html) to query the vertex buffer count.  
  
The data layout of the vertex buffer generally depends on a number of factors,
especially for Meshes that are compressed (see **Player Settings** > **Mesh
Compression Settings**) and marked as non-readable. For a simple case,
generally the layout is as follows:  
  
`float3 position` (12 bytes)  
`float3 normal` (12 bytes)  
`byte4 color32` (4 bytes) or `float4 color` (16 bytes)  
`float2|float3|float4 uv` (8, 12 or 16 bytes)  
`float2|float3|float4 uv2` (8, 12 or 16 bytes)  
`float2|float3|float4 uv3` (8, 12 or 16 bytes)  
`float2|float3|float4 uv4` (8, 12 or 16 bytes)  
`float4 tangent` (16 bytes)  
  
All vertex components are optional, for example a Mesh might contain only
position + normal + one 2D texture coordinate. In that case, the vertex data
size in the buffer would be 12+12+8=32 bytes.  
  
You can use [HasVertexAttribute](Mesh.HasVertexAttribute.html),
[GetVertexAttributeOffset](Mesh.GetVertexAttributeOffset.html),
[GetVertexBufferStride](Mesh.GetVertexBufferStride.html) methods to query
information about the vertex attribute layout of the Mesh.  
  
The type of data returned depends on the underlying graphics API:

  * ID3D11Buffer on D3D11
  * ID3D12Resource on D3D12
  * id<MTLBuffer> on Metal
  * buffer "name" (as GLuint) on OpenGL/ES
  * internal representation on Vulkan, that should be accessed via IUnityGraphicsVulkan interface

For most use cases (i.e. writing Mesh data from native code), you need to mark
the mesh as "dynamic" (see [MarkDynamic](Mesh.MarkDynamic.html)) before
getting the native buffer pointer. Generally this switches the buffers to be
CPU-writable.  
  
Note that calling this function when using multi-threaded rendering will
synchronize with the rendering thread (a slow operation), so best practice is
to set up necessary buffer pointers only at initialization time.

interface.html), [GetNativeIndexBufferPtr](Mesh.GetNativeIndexBufferPtr.html),
