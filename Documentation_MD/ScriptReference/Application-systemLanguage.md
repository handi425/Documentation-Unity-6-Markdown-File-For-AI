public static [SystemLanguage](SystemLanguage.html) systemLanguage;

### Description

The language in which the user's operating system is running in.

You can use this to automatically pick a localization for your content based
on the user's system language. Use `Application.systemLanguage` to find the
value of this setting.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            //This checks if your computer's operating system is in the French language
            if ([Application.systemLanguage](Application-systemLanguage.html) == [SystemLanguage.French](SystemLanguage.French.html))
            {
                //Outputs into console that the system is French
                [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("This system is in French. ");
            }
            //Otherwise, if the system is English, output the message in the console
            else if ([Application.systemLanguage](Application-systemLanguage.html) == [SystemLanguage.English](SystemLanguage.English.html))
            {
                [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("This system is in English. ");
            }
        }
    }
    
    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            //This outputs what language your system is in
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("This system is in " + [Application.systemLanguage](Application-systemLanguage.html));
        }
    }
