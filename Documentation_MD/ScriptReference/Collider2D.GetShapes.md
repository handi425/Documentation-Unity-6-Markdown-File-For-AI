## Declaration

public int GetShapes([PhysicsShapeGroup2D](PhysicsShapeGroup2D.html)
physicsShapeGroup);

### Parameters

physicsShapeGroup | The [PhysicsShapeGroup2D](PhysicsShapeGroup2D.html) to store the retrieved [PhysicsShape2D](PhysicsShape2D.html) in.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**int** Returns the number of [PhysicsShape2D](PhysicsShape2D.html) retrieved
from the [Collider2D](Collider2D.html).

### Description

Gets all the [PhysicsShape2D](PhysicsShape2D.html) used by the
[Collider2D](Collider2D.html).

All [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) represent a high-level definition of 2D
geometry that is used to create efficient low-level primitive shapes used by
the physics engine for collision detection. These low-level primitive shapes
are what the 2D physics gizmos draw within the Unity Editor. This method
provides access to a copy of these primitive shapes which can be useful in
various use-cases such as debugging and gizmos or rendering
[Collider2D](Collider2D.html) geometry at runtime.  
  
Use this method to gain access to a copy of all the low-level primitive shapes
that are produced by a [Collider2D](Collider2D.html). If no such shapes exist
on the [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) as indicated by
[Collider2D.shapeCount](Collider2D-shapeCount.html) then the shape group will
not be populated with shapes. If shapes do exist, the group is first emptied
before being populated with shapes.  
  
Each [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) produces either a single or multiple
[PhysicsShape2D](PhysicsShape2D.html) of a single
[PhysicsShapeType2D](PhysicsShapeType2D.html) as indicated below:

  * A [CircleCollider2D](CircleCollider2D.html) produces a single [PhysicsShapeType2D.Circle](PhysicsShapeType2D.Circle.html) object
  * A [CapsuleCollider2D](CapsuleCollider2D.html) produces a single [PhysicsShapeType2D.Capsule](PhysicsShapeType2D.Capsule.html) object
  * An [EdgeCollider2D](EdgeCollider2D.html) produces a single [PhysicsShapeType2D.Edges](PhysicsShapeType2D.Edges.html) object
  * A [BoxCollider2D](BoxCollider2D.html) produces a single [PhysicsShapeType2D.Polygon](PhysicsShapeType2D.Polygon.html) object (a box is a convex polygon)
  * A [PolygonCollider2D](PolygonCollider2D.html) produces either a single or multiple [PhysicsShapeType2D.Polygon](PhysicsShapeType2D.Polygon.html) object(s)
  * A [TilemapCollider2D](Tilemaps.TilemapCollider2D.html) produces either a single or multiple [PhysicsShapeType2D.Polygon](PhysicsShapeType2D.Polygon.html) object(s) (each tile can produce multiple polygons so this can produce a lot of data)
  * A [CompositeCollider2D](CompositeCollider2D.html) produces either a single or multiple [PhysicsShapeType2D.Polygon](PhysicsShapeType2D.Polygon.html) ([CompositeCollider2D.GeometryType.Polygons](CompositeCollider2D.GeometryType.Polygons.html)) or [PhysicsShapeType2D.Edges](PhysicsShapeType2D.Edges.html) ([CompositeCollider2D.GeometryType.Outlines](CompositeCollider2D.GeometryType.Outlines.html)) object(s)

All [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) shape vertices are stored in the local space
of the [Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) they are attached to i.e. their
vertices are relative to the pose of the [Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html)
therefore when a [Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) translates or rotates, the
vertices of attached [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) do not change. This is why
changes to position or rotation should only ever happen via the
[Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) as this is the most efficient method. When
retrieving shapes, the shape vertices are in the local space of the
[Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html). The current position and rotation of the
[Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) is stored in
[PhysicsShapeGroup2D.localToWorldMatrix](PhysicsShapeGroup2D-localToWorldMatrix.html)
and can be used to transform the shape vertices to world space. If the
[Collider2D](Collider2D.html) is not attached to any
[Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) i.e. it is Static then the local space and
world space are identical therefore the
[PhysicsShapeGroup2D.localToWorldMatrix](PhysicsShapeGroup2D-localToWorldMatrix.html)
is set to [Matrix4x4.identity](Matrix4x4-identity.html).  
  
**Note:** It is recommened to reuse the
[PhysicsShapeGroup2D](PhysicsShapeGroup2D.html) because then memory
allocations only occur if the number of shapes or vertices retrieved are
greater than the existing capacity of the
[PhysicsShapeGroup2D](PhysicsShapeGroup2D.html). Reusing this object therefore
minimizes allocations to a bare minimum and eventually to none so no work is
produced for the garbage collector.

## Declaration

public int GetShapes([PhysicsShapeGroup2D](PhysicsShapeGroup2D.html)
physicsShapeGroup, int shapeIndex, int shapeCount = 1);

### Parameters

physicsShapeGroup | The [PhysicsShapeGroup2D](PhysicsShapeGroup2D.html) to store the retrieved [PhysicsShape2D](PhysicsShape2D.html) in.  
---|---  
shapeIndex | The index of the first shape to retrieve. This should be in the range of 0 to [Collider2D.shapeCount](Collider2D-shapeCount.html)-1.  
shapeCount | The number of shapes to retrieve. The `shapeIndex` \+ `shapeCount` must be less than or equal to [Collider2D.shapeCount](Collider2D-shapeCount.html).  
  
### Returns

**int** Returns the number of [PhysicsShape2D](PhysicsShape2D.html) retrieved
from the [Collider2D](Collider2D.html). In all cases this should be the same
number as `shapeCount` .

### Description

Gets the specified range of the [PhysicsShape2D](PhysicsShape2D.html) used by
the [Collider2D](Collider2D.html).
