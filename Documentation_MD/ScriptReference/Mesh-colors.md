public Color[] colors;

### Description

Vertex colors of the Mesh.

If no vertex colors are available, an empty array will be returned.

    
    
    // Sets the vertex color to be red at the y=0 and green at y=1.
    // (Note that most built-in Shaders don't display vertex colors. Use one that does, such as a [Particle](ParticleSystem.Particle.html) [Shader](Shader.html), to see vertex colors)  
      
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            [Mesh](Mesh.html) mesh = GetComponent<[MeshFilter](MeshFilter.html)>().mesh;
            [Vector3](Vector3.html)[] vertices = mesh.vertices;  
      
            // create new colors array where the colors will be created.
            [Color](Color.html)[] colors = new [Color](Color.html)[vertices.Length];  
      
            for (int i = 0; i < vertices.Length; i++)
                colors[i] = [Color.Lerp](Color.Lerp.html)([Color.red](Color-red.html), [Color.green](Color-green.html), vertices[i].y);  
      
            // assign the array of colors to the [Mesh](Mesh.html).
            mesh.colors = colors;
        }
    }
    

For performance reasons, consider using [colors32](Mesh-colors32.html)
instead. This will avoid byte-to-float conversions in colors, and use less
temporary memory.
