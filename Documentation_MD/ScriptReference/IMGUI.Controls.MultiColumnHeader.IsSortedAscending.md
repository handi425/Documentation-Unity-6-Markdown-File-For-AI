## Declaration

public bool IsSortedAscending(int columnIndex);

### Parameters

columnIndex | Column index.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**bool** True if sorted ascending.

### Description

Check the sorting order state for a column.

This function checks and returns the sorting order; true for ascending order
and false for descending order. The order is preserved for each column so it
can be used to sort other columns. Use
[sortedColumnIndex](IMGUI.Controls.MultiColumnHeader-sortedColumnIndex.html)
to check if any column is actively used for sorting. You can then use that
column index to get the sorting order.
