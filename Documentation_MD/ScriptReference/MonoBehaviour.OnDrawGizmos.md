Component in the Manual")

### Description

Implement OnDrawGizmos if you want to draw gizmos that are also pickable and
always drawn.

This allows you to quickly pick important objects in your Scene.  
  
Note that OnDrawGizmos will use a mouse position that is relative to the Scene
View.  
  
This function does _not_ get called if the component is collapsed in the
Inspector. Use [OnDrawGizmosSelected](MonoBehaviour.OnDrawGizmosSelected.html)
to draw gizmos when the game object is selected.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void OnDrawGizmos()
        {
            // Draw a yellow sphere at the transform's position
            [Gizmos.color](Gizmos-color.html) = [Color.yellow](Color-yellow.html);
            [Gizmos.DrawSphere](Gizmos.DrawSphere.html)(transform.position, 1);
        }
    }
