## Declaration

public bool SendToEditor(string fileName);

### Parameters

fileName | Name of the GraphicsStateCollection file saved by the Editor.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**bool** Returns true if successfully sent, false otherwise.

### Description

Send GraphicsStateCollection to the Editor using PlayerConnection.

This method sends serialized GraphicsStateCollection data to a connected
Editor instance on-demand.  
  
The Editor instance will save the GraphicsStateCollection to disk in the open
project's Assets folder.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.Experimental.Rendering;
    using UnityEngine.Networking.PlayerConnection;  
      
    public class SendToEditorExample : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public [GraphicsStateCollection](Experimental.Rendering.GraphicsStateCollection.html) graphicsStateCollection;
        public string fileName;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            graphicsStateCollection = new [GraphicsStateCollection](Experimental.Rendering.GraphicsStateCollection.html)();
            graphicsStateCollection.BeginTrace();
        }  
      
        void OnDestroy()
        {
            graphicsStateCollection.EndTrace();
            if (PlayerConnection.instance.isConnected)
            {
                graphicsStateCollection.SendToEditor(fileName);
            }
            else
            {
                 [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("No [PlayerConnection](Networking.PlayerConnection.PlayerConnection.html) found! Collection not sent to [Editor](Editor.html).");
            }
        }
    }
