[ ]()

public static bool anyKeyDown;

### Description

Returns true the first frame the user hits any key or mouse button. (Read
Only)

**Note: This API is part of the legacy** `Input` **class, and not recommended
for new projects. The documentation is provided here to support legacy
projects that use the old Input Manager and Input class. For new projects you
should use the newer and Input System Package**. ([read
more](../Manual/Input.html)).  
  
You should be polling this variable from the
[Update](MonoBehaviour.Update.html) function, since the state gets reset each
frame. It will not return true until the user has released all keys / buttons
and pressed any key / buttons again. This does not detect touches. For
touches, use [Input.touchCount](Input-touchCount.html).

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        // Detects if any key has been pressed down.  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            if ([Input.anyKeyDown](Input-anyKeyDown.html))
            {
                [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("A key or mouse click has been detected");
            }
        }
    }
