public int height;

### Description

Height of the Texture in pixels (Read Only).

This value is the height of the Texture at the highest resolution that
[PlayerSettings.mipStripping](PlayerSettings-mipStripping.html) allows.  
  
In the Unity Editor, this returns the height of the Texture at full
resolution.  
  
At run time, if [PlayerSettings.mipStripping](PlayerSettings-
mipStripping.html) is disabled, this returns the height of the Texture at full
resolution. If [PlayerSettings.mipStripping](PlayerSettings-mipStripping.html)
is enabled, this returns the height of the Texture at the highest resolution
that has not been stripped.  
  
Additional resources:
[QualitySettings.globalTextureMipmapLimit](QualitySettings-
globalTextureMipmapLimit.html), [PlayerSettings.mipStripping](PlayerSettings-
mipStripping.html).

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        // Print [Texture](Texture.html) size to the Console
        [Texture](Texture.html) [Texture](Texture.html);
        void Start()
        {
            print("Size is " + [Texture.width](Texture-width.html) + " by " + [Texture.height](Texture-height.html));
        }
    }
