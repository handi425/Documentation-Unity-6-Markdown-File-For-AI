## Declaration

public static RaycastHit2D[] BoxCastAll([Vector2](Vector2.html) origin,
[Vector2](Vector2.html) size, float angle, [Vector2](Vector2.html) direction,
float distance = Mathf.Infinity, int layerMask = DefaultRaycastLayers, float
minDepth = -Mathf.Infinity, float maxDepth = Mathf.Infinity);

### Parameters

origin | The point in 2D space where the box originates.  
---|---  
size | The size of the box.  
angle | The angle of the box (in degrees).  
direction | A vector representing the direction of the box.  
distance | The maximum distance over which to cast the box.  
layerMask | Filter to detect Colliders only on certain layers.  
minDepth | Only include objects with a Z coordinate (depth) greater than or equal to this value.  
maxDepth | Only include objects with a Z coordinate (depth) less than or equal to this value.  
  
### Returns

**RaycastHit2D[]** The cast results returned.

### Description

Casts a box against Colliders in the Scene, returning all Colliders that
contact with it.

A _BoxCast_ is conceptually like dragging a box through the Scene in a
particular direction. Any object making contact with the box can be detected
and reported.  
  
This function is similar to the [BoxCast](Physics2D.BoxCast.html) function but
instead of detecting just the first Collider that is hit, an array of all
Colliders along the path of the box is returned. The Colliders in the array
are sorted in order of distance from the origin point. The _layerMask_ can be
used to detect objects selectively only on certain layers (this allows you to
apply the detection only to enemy characters, for example).  
  
The returned [RaycastHit2D](RaycastHit2D.html) returns both the point and
normal of the contact where the box would touch the Collider. It also returns
the centroid where the box would be positioned for it to contact at that
point.
