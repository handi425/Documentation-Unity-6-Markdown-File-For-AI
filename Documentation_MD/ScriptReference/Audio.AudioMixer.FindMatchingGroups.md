## Declaration

public AudioMixerGroup[] FindMatchingGroups(string subPath);

### Parameters

subPath | Path sub-strings to match with.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**AudioMixerGroup[]** Groups in the mixer whose paths match the specified
search path.

### Description

Connected groups in the mixer form a path from the mixer's master group to the
leaves. This path has the format **Master Group/Child of Master
Group/Grandchild of Master Group** , and so on. For example, in the hierarchy
below, the group DROPS has the path **Master/WATER/DROPS**. To return only the
group called **DROPS** , enter **DROPS**. The substring **Master/AMBIENCE**
returns three groups, **AMBIENCE/CROWD** , **AMBIENCE/ROAD** , and
**AMBIENCE**. The substring **/R** would return both **ROAD** and **RIVER**.
