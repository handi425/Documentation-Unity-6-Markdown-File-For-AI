### Description

Options for the set of sizing values to apply to the Universal Windows
Platform logo and icon images. These options specify variations for different
screen sizes and resolutions.

A Universal Windows Platform application must specify [icon and logo
images](PlayerSettings.WSAImageType.html) as part of the package before you
can submit it to the Microsoft Store. Since these images are bitmaps, they do
not scale well on different display types. Because of this, applications
should include different versions of these images at different scales and
sizes so the icon/logo always displays correctly. Unity exposes two sets of
sizing values to use:

  * Scaling values: Indicates that an image asset is scaled by a certain factor from the base image size.
  * Target size: Indicates that the application icon is for a specific pixel size. This is only applicable for the Square44x44Logo type.

Target size assets are for surfaces that don't use the scaling plateau system:

  * Start jump list (desktop).
  * Start in the lower corner of the tile (desktop).
  * Shortcuts (desktop).
  * Control Panel (desktop).

For information on Universal Windows Platform application icons and logos, see
[Microsoft's documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-
us/windows/uwp/design/style/app-icons-and-logos).  
**Important:** Unity writes image types to the package manifest when it builds
Universal Windows Platform for the first time. Building into an existing
Universal Windows Platform build folder does not update the package manifest
and does not apply any changes.
