## Declaration

public static [Vector2](Vector2.html) GUIToScreenPoint([Vector2](Vector2.html)
guiPoint);

### Description

Convert a point from GUI position to screen space.

**Note:** In Unity the screen space **y** coordinate varies from zero at the
top edge of the window to a maximum at the bottom edge of the window. This is
different from what you might expect.

        void OnGUI()
        {
