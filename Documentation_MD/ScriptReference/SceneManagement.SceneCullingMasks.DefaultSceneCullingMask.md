public static ulong DefaultSceneCullingMask;

### Description

Specifies the default culling mask for a Scene. Use the bits from this Scene
culling mask for objects that you want to render in both in the Game view and
the Scene view.

All normal Scenes start with this culling mask by default. The Scenes created
through
[EditorSceneManager.NewPreviewScene](SceneManagement.EditorSceneManager.NewPreviewScene.html)
get their own unique Scene culling mask which is why the GameObjects in those
Scenes do not show up in the Scene view and Game view by default.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
