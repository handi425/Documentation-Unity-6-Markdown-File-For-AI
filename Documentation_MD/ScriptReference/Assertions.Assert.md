### Description

The Assert class contains assertion methods for setting invariants in the
code.

All method calls will be conditionally included only in a development build,
unless specified explicitly. See
[BuildOptions.ForceEnableAssertions](BuildOptions.ForceEnableAssertions.html).
The inclusion of an assertion is controlled by the `UNITY_ASSERTIONS` define.  
  
Assert throws exceptions whenever an assertion fails.  
  
If a debugger is attached to the project
(System.Diagnostics.Debugger.IsAttached is true),
[AssertionException](Assertions.AssertionException.html) is thrown to pause
the execution and invoke the debugger.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.Assertions;  
      
    public class AssertionExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public int health;
        public [GameObject](GameObject.html) go;  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            // You expect the health never to be equal to zero
            [Assert.AreNotEqual](Assertions.Assert.AreNotEqual.html)(0, health);  
      
            // The referenced [GameObject](GameObject.html) should be always (in every frame) be active
            [Assert.IsTrue](Assertions.Assert.IsTrue.html)(go.activeInHierarchy);
        }
    }
