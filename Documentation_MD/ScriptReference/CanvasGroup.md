### Description

A [Canvas](Canvas.html) placable element that can be used to modify children
Alpha, Raycasting, Enabled state.

A canvas group can be used to modify the state of children elements.  
  
An example of this would be a window which fades in over time, by modifying
the alpha value of the group the children elements will be affected. The
result alpha will be the multiplied result of any nested groups, multiplied
with the canvas elements alpha.  
  
You can configure Canvas Groups to not block raycasts. When you configure a
Canvas Group to not block raycasts, graphic raycasting ignores anything in the
group.  
  
Let's say you have a Canvas GameObject with a CanvasGroup component on it, and
you set the CanvasGroup component's alpha to 0. In that case, the Canvas does
not render any of its child GameObjects. Now suppose that the Canvas also has
a child CanvasGroup GameObject that you do want to render. If you enable
IgnoreParentGroups for the CanvasGroup GameObject, the parent Canvas does not
render any of its child GameObjects, including the CanvasGroup you want to
render. To get the child CanvasGroup GameObject, do one of two things: In the
parent Canvas, set the CanvasGroup component's alpha to a small, non-zero
value. Add a Canvas component to the child CanvasGroup GameObject that you
want to render.

### Properties

---|---  
[blocksRaycasts](CanvasGroup-blocksRaycasts.html)| Does this group block
raycasting (allow collision).  
[ignoreParentGroups](CanvasGroup-ignoreParentGroups.html)| Should the group

component on its parent GameObject.  
[GetComponentInParent](Component.GetComponentInParent.html)| Gets a reference
to a component of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, or
any parent of the GameObject.
