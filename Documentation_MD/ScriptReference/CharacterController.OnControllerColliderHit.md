### Description

OnControllerColliderHit is called when the controller hits a collider while
performing a Move.

This can be used to push objects when they collide with the character.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        // this script pushes all rigidbodies that the character touches
        float pushPower = 2.0f;
        void OnControllerColliderHit([ControllerColliderHit](ControllerColliderHit.html) hit)
        {
            [Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html) body = hit.collider.attachedRigidbody;  
      
            // no rigidbody
            if (body == null || body.isKinematic)
            {
                return;
            }  
      
            // We dont want to push objects below us
            if (hit.moveDirection.y < -0.3)
            {
                return;
            }  
      
            // Calculate push direction from move direction,
            // we only push objects to the sides never up and down
            [Vector3](Vector3.html) pushDir = new [Vector3](Vector3.html)(hit.moveDirection.x, 0, hit.moveDirection.z);  
      
            // If you know how fast your character is trying to move,
            // then you can also multiply the push velocity by that.  
      
            // Apply the push
            body.velocity = pushDir * pushPower;
        }
    }
