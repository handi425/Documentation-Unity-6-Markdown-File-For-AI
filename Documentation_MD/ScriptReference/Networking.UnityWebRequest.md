### Description

Provides methods to communicate with web servers.

`UnityWebRequest` handles the flow of HTTP communication with web servers. To
download and upload data, use
[DownloadHandler](Networking.DownloadHandler.html) and
[UploadHandler](Networking.UploadHandler.html) respectively.  
  
`UnityWebRequest` includes static utility functions that return
`UnityWebRequest` instances configured for common use cases. For example:

  * [UnityWebRequest.Get](Networking.UnityWebRequest.Get.html)
  * [UnityWebRequest.Post](Networking.UnityWebRequest.Post.html)
  * [UnityWebRequest.Put](Networking.UnityWebRequest.Put.html)

To send a web request from a `UnityWebRequest` instance, call
[UnityWebRequest.SendWebRequest](Networking.UnityWebRequest.SendWebRequest.html).
After the `UnityWebRequest` begins to communicate with a remote server, you
can't change any of the properties in that `UnityWebRequest` instance. HTTPS
is supported, server certificate is validated against the root certificate
store available on the system the app runs on. Validation can be disabled (for
example for development server using self-signed certificate) or changed to a
custom handling by assigning
[UnityWebRequest.certificateHandler](Networking.UnityWebRequest-
certificateHandler.html) property.  
  
Depending on the platform your application runs on, `UnityWebRequest` either
sets the [User-Agent header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent) itself or leaves it for the operating
system to set. `UnityWebRequest` sets the `User-Agent` header for all
platforms except iOS and WebGL.  
  
**Note** : From Unity 2019.2, `UnityWebRequest` sets the `User-Agent` header
for Android devices. In earlier releases, the operating system set the `User-
Agent` header.  
  
**Note** : If the device that the application runs on uses proxy settings,
`UnityWebRequest` applies the proxy settings after the application sends the
request.
