## Declaration

public bool SamplePathPosition(int areaMask, float maxDistance, out
[AI.NavMeshHit](AI.NavMeshHit.html) hit);

### Parameters

areaMask | A bitfield mask specifying which NavMesh areas can be passed when tracing the path.  
---|---  
maxDistance | Terminate scanning the path at this distance.  
hit | Holds the properties of the resulting location.  
  
### Returns

**bool** True if terminated before reaching the position at maxDistance, false
otherwise.

### Description

Sample a position along the current path.

This function looks ahead a specified distance along the current path. Details
of the mesh at that position are then returned in a
[NavMeshHit](AI.NavMeshHit.html) object. This could be used, for example, to
check the type of surface that lies ahead before the character gets there - a
character could raise his gun above his head if he is about to wade through
water, say.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.AI;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public [Transform](Transform.html) target;
        private [NavMeshAgent](AI.NavMeshAgent.html) agent;
        private int waterMask;  
      
    
        void Start()
        {
            agent = GetComponent<[NavMeshAgent](AI.NavMeshAgent.html)>();
            waterMask = 1 << [NavMesh.GetAreaFromName](AI.NavMesh.GetAreaFromName.html)("Water");
            agent.SetDestination(target.position);
        }  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            [NavMeshHit](AI.NavMeshHit.html) hit;  
      
            // Check all areas one length unit ahead.
            if (!agent.SamplePathPosition([NavMesh.AllAreas](AI.NavMesh.AllAreas.html), 1.0F, out hit))
                if ((hit.mask & waterMask) != 0)
                {
                    // Water detected along the path...
                }
        }
    }
