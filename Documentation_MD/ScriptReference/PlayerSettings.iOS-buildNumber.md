Component in the Manual")

public static string buildNumber;

### Description

The build number of the bundle

It is saved to the 'CFBundleVersion' field in the built app's info.plist file.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);  
      
    public class BuildNumberExample
    {
        // This example will create a [Menu](Menu.html) [Item](Progress.Item.html) called "Increase Minor Build Number" under "Examples" submenu which when pressed will get the current "Build" property and increase the Minor version by 1 
        // Assuming the "Build" property follows the format Major.Minor.Patch (for example 2.0.5 will be increased to 2.1.0),
        [[MenuItem](MenuItem.html)("Examples/Increase Minor Build Number")]
        public static void IncreaseMinorBuildNumber()
        {
            // Get the current build number value
            string currentBuildNumberString = [PlayerSettings.iOS.buildNumber](PlayerSettings.iOS-buildNumber.html);  
      
            // Separate the build number string to Major, Minor and Patch numbers
            string[] separatedBuildNumbers = currentBuildNumberString.Split('.');  
      
            // Parse the Major and Minor version numbers to integer values
            int majorVersionNumber = int.Parse(separatedBuildNumbers[0]);
            int minorVersionNumber = int.Parse(separatedBuildNumbers[1]);  
      
            // Increment the Minor version number
            minorVersionNumber++;
            
            // [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html) the buildNumber property with the new values:
            // - keep the old Major version number;
            // - update Minor version number;
            // - replace Patch version number with 0, since Minor version was updated. 
            [PlayerSettings.iOS.buildNumber](PlayerSettings.iOS-buildNumber.html) = string.Format("{0}.{1}.{2}", majorVersionNumber, minorVersionNumber, 0);
        }
    }
