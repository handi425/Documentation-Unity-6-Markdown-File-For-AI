public uint paddingPower;

### Description

The amount of extra padding between packed sprites.

Expressed as the power of 2 minus 1 (i.e. paddingPower of 0 enforces a 2 pixel
gap between, paddingPower of 1 - 4 pixel gap, paddingPower of 2 - 8 pixel gap,
etc.). This can be used to prevent sprites from bleeding into each other in
lower mip levels.
