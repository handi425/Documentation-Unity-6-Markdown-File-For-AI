### Description

`OnBecameVisible` is called when the object became visible by any camera.

This message is sent to all scripts attached to the renderer.
`OnBecameVisible` and `OnBecameInvisible` are useful to avoid computations
that are only necessary when the object is visible.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class BecomeVisible : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        // Disable this script when the [GameObject](GameObject.html) moves out of the camera's view
        void OnBecameInvisible()
        {
            enabled = false;
        }  
      
        // Enable this script when the [GameObject](GameObject.html) moves into the camera's view
        void OnBecameVisible()
        {
            enabled = true;
        }  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("Script is enabled");
        }
    }
    

Note that object is considered visible when it needs to be rendered in the
Scene. It might not be actually visible by any camera, but still need to be
rendered for shadows for example. Also, when running in the editor, the Scene
view cameras will also cause this function to be called.
