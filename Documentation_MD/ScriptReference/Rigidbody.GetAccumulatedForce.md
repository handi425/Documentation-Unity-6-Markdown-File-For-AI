[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-Rigidbody.html "Go to Rigidbody Component
in the Manual")

## Declaration

public [Vector3](Vector3.html) GetAccumulatedForce(float step =
Time.fixedDeltaTime);

### Parameters

step | The timestep of the next physics simulation.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**Vector3** Accumulated force expressed in
[ForceMode.Force](ForceMode.Force.html).

### Description

Returns the force that the [Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html) has accumulated before
the simulation step.

The accumulated force is reset during each physics simulation step.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class AddForceScript : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        private [Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html) rigidbody;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            rigidbody = GetComponent<[Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html)>();
            rigidbody.useGravity = false;
        }  
      
        private void [FixedUpdate](PlayerLoop.FixedUpdate.html)()
        {
            rigidbody.AddForce([Vector3.up](Vector3-up.html) * 10f, [ForceMode.Impulse](ForceMode.Impulse.html));
            var accumulatedForce = rigidbody.GetAccumulatedForce();
            rigidbody.AddForce(accumulatedForce * -1f, [ForceMode.Force](ForceMode.Force.html));
        }
    }
    

In this example, the Rigidbody doesn't move.
