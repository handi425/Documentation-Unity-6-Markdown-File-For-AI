## Declaration

public static List<SearchItem>
GetItems([Search.SearchContext](Search.SearchContext.html) context,
[Search.SearchFlags](Search.SearchFlags.html) options);

### Parameters

context | The current search context.  
---|---  
options | Options defining how the query is performed.  
  
### Returns

**List <SearchItem>** A list of search items matching the search query.

### Description

Initiates a search and returns all search items matching the search context.
Other items can be found later using asynchronous searches.

Unity suggests using
[SearchService.Request](Search.SearchService.Request.html) to execute a search
query. `GetItems` usually requires setting up more context to achieve a good
result. The following is a small example that uses `GetItems`.

    
    
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);
    using UnityEditor.Search;
    using UnityEngine;
    
    static class Example_SearchService_GetItems
    {
        [[MenuItem](MenuItem.html)("Examples/[SearchService](Search.SearchService.html)/GetItems")]
        public static void Run()
        {
            // Create a container to hold found items.
            var results = new List<[SearchItem](Search.SearchItem.html)>();
    
            // Create the search context that will be used to execute the query.
            using (var searchContext = [SearchService.CreateContext](Search.SearchService.CreateContext.html)("scene", "is:leaf"))
            {
                // Initiate the query and get the results.
                // Note: it is recommended to use [SearchService.Request](Search.SearchService.Request.html) if you wish to fetch the items asynchronously.
                results = [SearchService.GetItems](Search.SearchService.GetItems.html)(searchContext, [SearchFlags.WantsMore](Search.SearchFlags.WantsMore.html) | [SearchFlags.Synchronous](Search.SearchFlags.Synchronous.html));
    
                // Print results
                foreach (var searchItem in results)
                    [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)(searchItem.GetDescription(searchContext));
            }
        }
    }
