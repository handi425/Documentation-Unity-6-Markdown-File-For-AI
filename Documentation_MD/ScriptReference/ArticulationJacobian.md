### Description

The floating point dense Jacobian matrix of the articulation body hierarchy.

Jacobian matrix is important concept used in robotics and inverse kinematics.
Multiplication with the Jacobian matrix maps the reduced coordinate space
joint velocities of the articulated body to world space velocities. Also can
be used for inverse kinematics, because it can provide relation between joint
velocities and end effector velocities of the articulated body. Additional
resources:
[ArticulationBody.GetDenseJacobian](ArticulationBody.GetDenseJacobian.html).

### Properties

[columns](ArticulationJacobian-columns.html)| Number of columns of the matrix
is equal to the total number of all joint degrees of freedom(DOF), plus 6 if
ArticulationBody.immovable is false.  
---|---  
[elements](ArticulationJacobian-elements.html)| List of floats representing
Jacobian matrix.  
[rows](ArticulationJacobian-rows.html)| Number of rows of the matrix is equal
to the number of articulation bodies in hierarchy times 6: 3 rows of
linear/positional DOF and 3 rows of angular/rotational DOF for each body.  
[this[int,int]](ArticulationJacobian.Index_operator.html)| Gets the [row, col]
element of the matrix.  
  
### Constructors

[ArticulationJacobian](ArticulationJacobian-ctor.html)| Initializes nRows X
nCols Jacobian matrix to zeroes.
