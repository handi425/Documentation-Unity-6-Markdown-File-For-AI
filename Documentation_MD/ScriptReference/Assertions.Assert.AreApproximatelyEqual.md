## Declaration

## Declaration

public static void AreApproximatelyEqual(float expected, float actual, string
message);

## Declaration

public static void AreApproximatelyEqual(float expected, float actual, float
tolerance);

## Declaration

public static void AreApproximatelyEqual(float expected, float actual, float
tolerance, string message);

### Parameters

tolerance | Tolerance of approximation.  
---|---  
expected | The assumed [Assert](Assertions.Assert.html) value.  
actual | The exact [Assert](Assertions.Assert.html) value.  
message | The string used to describe the [Assert](Assertions.Assert.html).  
  
### Description

Assert the values are approximately equal.

An absolute error check is used for approximate equality check (|a-b| <
`tolerance`). Default `tolerance` is 0.00001f.  
  
Note: Every time you call the method with tolerance specified, a new instance
of [FloatComparer](Assertions.Comparers.FloatComparer.html) is created. For
performance reasons you might want to instance your own comparer and pass it
to the [AreApproximatelyEqual](Assertions.Assert.AreApproximatelyEqual.html)
method. If the tolerance is not specifies, a default comparer is used and the
issue does not occur.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.Assertions;  
      
    public class AssertionExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            // Make sure the position of the [GameObject](GameObject.html) is always in the center of the [Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html).
            // AreApproximatelyEqual should be used for comparing floating point variables.
            // Unless specified, default error tolerance will be used.
            [Assert.AreApproximatelyEqual](Assertions.Assert.AreApproximatelyEqual.html)(0.0f, transform.position.x);
            [Assert.AreApproximatelyEqual](Assertions.Assert.AreApproximatelyEqual.html)(0.0f, transform.position.y);
            [Assert.AreApproximatelyEqual](Assertions.Assert.AreApproximatelyEqual.html)(0.0f, transform.position.z);
        }
    }
