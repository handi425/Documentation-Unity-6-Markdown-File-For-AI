It has a depth of -1 whereas the rows of the TreeView will have a depth of 0
or higher. The rootItem can be used for traversing the items created in
[BuildRoot](IMGUI.Controls.TreeView.BuildRoot.html) (if a full tree was
created).

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
