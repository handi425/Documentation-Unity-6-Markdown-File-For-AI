public
[IMGUI.Controls.PrimitiveBoundsHandle.Axes](IMGUI.Controls.PrimitiveBoundsHandle.Axes.html)
axes;

### Description

Flags specifying which axes should display control handles.

By default, all axes are enabled. You can use bitwise operations to enable or
disable individual axes. Disabled axes are flattened out.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);
    using UnityEditor.IMGUI.Controls;  
      
    public class ExampleScript : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            // create a 2D box handle that only works on the x- and y-axes
            [BoxBoundsHandle](IMGUI.Controls.BoxBoundsHandle.html) box = new [BoxBoundsHandle](IMGUI.Controls.BoxBoundsHandle.html)("MyBox".GetHashCode());
            box.axes = [PrimitiveBoundsHandle.Axes.X](IMGUI.Controls.PrimitiveBoundsHandle.Axes.X.html) | [PrimitiveBoundsHandle.Axes.Y](IMGUI.Controls.PrimitiveBoundsHandle.Axes.Y.html);
        }
    }
