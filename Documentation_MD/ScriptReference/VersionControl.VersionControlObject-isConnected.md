[ ]()

public bool isConnected;

### Description

Tests whether the
[VersionControlObject](VersionControl.VersionControlObject.html) is connected
to an underlying version control system.

There are various reasons why your VersionControlObject may not be connected.
For example:

  * Your VCS might need to be configured before establishing connection.
  * [OnActivate](VersionControl.VersionControlObject.OnActivate.html) might start a background thread that takes some time to connect.
  * The connection might get broken because of network issues.

In all these cases this property will return **false**.
