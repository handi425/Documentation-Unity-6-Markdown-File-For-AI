[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-PackageManager.html "Go to PackageManager
Component in the Manual")

## Declaration

public static
[PackageManager.Requests.EmbedRequest](PackageManager.Requests.EmbedRequest.html)
Embed(string packageName);

### Parameters

packageName | The name of the package to embed. This package must be a direct dependency of the project. `ArgumentException` is thrown if `packageName` is `null` or empty.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**EmbedRequest** An [EmbedRequest](PackageManager.Requests.EmbedRequest.html)
instance, which you can use to get the
[PackageInfo](PackageManager.PackageInfo.html) representing the embedded
package from the `EmbedRequest.Result` property.

### Description

[Embeds](../Manual/upm-embed.html) a package inside the project.

The Package Manager makes a copy of the original package inside the `Packages`
folder of the project. All files inside that package become writable.  
  
`Embed()` is an asynchronous operation. Before the operation is complete, you
can use the `EmbedRequest` instance to monitor the asynchronous operation.  
  
  
**Note:** Make sure any other Client operations have completed before calling
this method. For more information, see the note on the
[Client](PackageManager.Client.html) class reference page.
