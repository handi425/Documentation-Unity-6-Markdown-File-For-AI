checkOnlyUnityVersion);

### Parameters

### Description

Use this overload during the development cycle to avoid the AssemblyUpdater
check that is performed on game code built outside of Unity and imported as
assemblies. You can also avoid this check by passing disable-assembly-updater
as a command line argument (see the Unity Manual for more details).

**Obsolete** This overload of the attribute has been deprecated. Use the
constructor that takes the version and a boolean.
