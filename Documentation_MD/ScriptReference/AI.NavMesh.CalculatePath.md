## Declaration

public static bool CalculatePath([Vector3](Vector3.html) sourcePosition,
[Vector3](Vector3.html) targetPosition, int areaMask,
[AI.NavMeshPath](AI.NavMeshPath.html) path);

### Parameters

sourcePosition | The initial position of the path requested.  
---|---  
targetPosition | The final position of the path requested.  
areaMask | A bitfield mask specifying which NavMesh areas can be passed when calculating a path.  
path | The resulting path.  
  
### Returns

**bool** True if either a complete or partial path is found. False otherwise.

### Description

Calculate a path between two points and store the resulting path.

Use this function to avoid gameplay delays by planning a path before it is
needed. You can also use this function to check if a target position is
reachable before moving the agent.  
  
This function is synchronous. It performs path finding immediately which can
adversely affect the frame rate when processing very long paths. It is
recommended to only perform a few path finds per frame when, for example,
evaluating distances to cover points.  
  
Use the returned path to set the path for an agent with
[NavMeshAgent.SetPath](AI.NavMeshAgent.SetPath.html). For SetPath to work, the
agent must be close to the starting point.

    
    
    // ShowGoldenPath
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.AI;  
      
    public class ShowGoldenPath : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public [Transform](Transform.html) target;
        private [NavMeshPath](AI.NavMeshPath.html) path;
        private float elapsed = 0.0f;
        void Start()
        {
            path = new [NavMeshPath](AI.NavMeshPath.html)();
            elapsed = 0.0f;
        }  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            // [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html) the way to the goal every second.
            elapsed += [Time.deltaTime](Time-deltaTime.html);
            if (elapsed > 1.0f)
            {
                elapsed -= 1.0f;
                [NavMesh.CalculatePath](AI.NavMesh.CalculatePath.html)(transform.position, target.position, [NavMesh.AllAreas](AI.NavMesh.AllAreas.html), path);
            }
            for (int i = 0; i < path.corners.Length - 1; i++)
                [Debug.DrawLine](Debug.DrawLine.html)(path.corners[i], path.corners[i + 1], [Color.red](Color-red.html));
        }
    }

## Declaration

public static bool CalculatePath([Vector3](Vector3.html) sourcePosition,
[Vector3](Vector3.html) targetPosition,
[AI.NavMeshQueryFilter](AI.NavMeshQueryFilter.html) filter,
[AI.NavMeshPath](AI.NavMeshPath.html) path);

### Parameters

sourcePosition | The initial position of the path requested.  
---|---  
targetPosition | The final position of the path requested.  
filter | A filter specifying the cost of NavMesh areas that can be passed when calculating a path.  
path | The resulting path.  
  
### Returns

**bool** True if a either a complete or partial path is found and false
otherwise.

### Description

Calculates a path between two positions mapped to the NavMesh, subject to the
constraints and costs defined by the filter argument.
