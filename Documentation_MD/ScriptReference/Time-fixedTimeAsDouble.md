public static double fixedTimeAsDouble;

### Description

The double precision time since the last
[FixedUpdate](MonoBehaviour.FixedUpdate.html) started (Read Only). This is the
time in seconds since the start of the game.

Fixed time is updated in regular intervals (equal to [fixedDeltaTime](Time-
fixedDeltaTime.html)) until the [timeAsDouble](Time-timeAsDouble.html)
property is reached. This property is the double precision version of
[fixedTime](Time-fixedTime.html). This offers more precision than a float or
single value, particularly over extended periods of real-world time. In almost
all cases, you should use the [fixedTimeAsDouble](Time-fixedTimeAsDouble.html)
equivalent over [fixedTime](Time-fixedTime.html).

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
**Known Issue**. Please check with the Issue Tracker at
