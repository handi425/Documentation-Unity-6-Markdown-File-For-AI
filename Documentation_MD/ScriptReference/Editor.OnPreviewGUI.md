## Declaration

public void OnPreviewGUI([Rect](Rect.html) r, [GUIStyle](GUIStyle.html)
background);

### Parameters

r | The rectangle in which to draw the preview.  
---|---  
background | Background image.  
  
### Description

Creates a custom preview for the preview area of the Inspector, the headers of
the primary Editor, and the object selector.  
  
You must implement [Editor.HasPreviewGUI](Editor.HasPreviewGUI.html) for this
method to be called.

If you implement
[OnInteractivePreviewGUI](Editor.OnInteractivePreviewGUI.html), then this
method is only called for non-interactive custom previews. The overidden
method should render a preview of the asset in the specified rectangle (r).
The default implementation is a no-op.  
  
**Note:** Inspector previews are limited to the primary Editor of persistent
objects, such as GameObjectInspector, MaterialEditor, and TextureInspector. A
component cannot have its own Inspector preview.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);  
      
    [CreateAssetMenu]
    class MyObject : [ScriptableObject](ScriptableObject.html)
    {
        public string text;
    }  
      
    // Show a preview of the text saved in MyObject.
    [[CustomEditor](CustomEditor.html)(typeof(MyObject))]
    public class MyObjectEditor : [Editor](Editor.html)
    {
        public override bool HasPreviewGUI() => true;  
      
        public override void OnPreviewGUI([Rect](Rect.html) r, [GUIStyle](GUIStyle.html) background)
        {
            [GUI.Label](GUI.Label.html)(r, (target as MyObject).text);
        }
    }
