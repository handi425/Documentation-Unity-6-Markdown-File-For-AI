in the Manual")

## Declaration

public static [Quaternion](Quaternion.html)
Normalize([Quaternion](Quaternion.html) q);

### Description

Converts this quaternion to a quaternion with the same orientation but with a
magnitude of 1.0.

Note that this method changes the current quaternion. If you want to keep the
current quaternion unchanged, use the [normalized](Quaternion-normalized.html)
property instead.  
  
If this quaternion is too small to be normalized it will be set to
[Quaternion.identity](Quaternion-identity.html).  
  
Additional resources: [normalized](Quaternion-normalized.html) variable.
