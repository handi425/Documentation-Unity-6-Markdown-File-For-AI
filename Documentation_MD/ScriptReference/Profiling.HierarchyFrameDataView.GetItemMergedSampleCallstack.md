## Declaration

public void GetItemMergedSampleCallstack(int id, int sampleIndex, List<ulong>
outCallstack);

### Parameters

sampleIndex | Merged sample index.  
---|---  
id | Hierarchy item identifier.  
outCallstack | List filled with callstack pointers as a result of a method call.  
  
### Description

Gets the callstack associated with the specified hierarchy item.

When the callstack collection mode is enabled for certain profiler markers
(such as GC.Alloc), the profiler writes the callstack to the data stream. The
callstack refers to the instruction pointer stack. Instruction pointers can be
resolved into function names which you can the use to identify the sample
origin in the source code. _GetItemCallstack_ retrieves the callstack as a
list of pointers. Each list entry represents a function call.  
  
Use
[FrameDataView.ResolveMethodInfo](Profiling.FrameDataView.ResolveMethodInfo.html)
to get funtion name and location information for the instruction pointer.
