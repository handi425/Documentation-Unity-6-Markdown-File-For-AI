## Declaration

public static float SmoothDampAngle(float current, float target, ref float
currentVelocity, float smoothTime, float maxSpeed = Mathf.Infinity, float
deltaTime = Time.deltaTime);

### Parameters

current | The current position.  
---|---  
target | The target position.  
currentVelocity | The current velocity. This method modifies the currentVelocity every time the method is called.  
smoothTime | The approximate time it takes to reach the target position. The lower the value the faster this method reaches the target. The minimum value is 0.0001. If a lower value is specified, it is automatically clamped to this minimum value.  
maxSpeed | Use this optional parameter to specify a maximum speed. By default, the maximum speed is set to infinity.  
deltaTime | The time since this method was last called. By default, this is set to `Time.deltaTime`.  
  
### Description

Gradually changes an angle given in degrees towards a desired goal angle over
time.

This method smoothes the value with a spring-damper like algorithm that never
overshoots the target value. This algorithm is based on Game Programming Gems
4, Chapter 1.10.  
  
**Note:** This method attempts to avoid overshooting the target value. When
deltaTime is 0.0f, this yields NaN for the currentVelocity. If you call back
with a currentVelocity of NaN, this method returns a NaN.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        //A simple smooth follow camera,
        // that follows the targets forward direction  
      
        [Transform](Transform.html) target;
        float smooth = 0.3f;
        float distance = 5.0f;
        float yVelocity = 0.0f;  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            // Damp angle from current y-angle towards target y-angle
            float yAngle = [Mathf.SmoothDampAngle](Mathf.SmoothDampAngle.html)(transform.eulerAngles.y, target.eulerAngles.y, ref yVelocity, smooth);
            // [Position](UIElements.Position.html) at the target
            [Vector3](Vector3.html) position = target.position;
            // Then offset by distance behind the new angle
            position += [Quaternion.Euler](Quaternion.Euler.html)(0, yAngle, 0) * new [Vector3](Vector3.html)(0, 0, -distance);
            // Apply the position
            transform.position = position;  
      
            // Look at the target
            transform.LookAt(target);
        }
    }
