### Description

This context encapsulate all the datas needed to evaluate a
[SearchExpression](Search.SearchExpression.html) and it allows user to
interact with the evaluation runtime of an expression. A
SearchExpressionContext is created automatically with a
[SearchExpressionRuntime](Search.SearchExpressionRuntime.html) anytime
[SearchExpression.Execute](Search.SearchExpression.Execute.html) is called.

Here is an example showing ow the SearchExpressionContext is used during
evaluation:

    
    
    [SearchExpressionEvaluator([SearchExpressionType.Iterable](Search.SearchExpressionType.Iterable.html) | [SearchExpressionType.Variadic](Search.SearchExpressionType.Variadic.html))]
    [SearchExpressionEvaluatorSignatureOverload([SearchExpressionType.Number](Search.SearchExpressionType.Number.html), [SearchExpressionType.Iterable](Search.SearchExpressionType.Iterable.html) | [SearchExpressionType.Variadic](Search.SearchExpressionType.Variadic.html))]
    [Description("Extract and returns the X first results for each expression.")]
    public static IEnumerable<[SearchItem](Search.SearchItem.html)> TakeXFirst([SearchExpressionContext](Search.SearchExpressionContext.html) c)
    {
        var argIndex = 0;
        var takeNumber = 1;
        if (c.args[0].types.HasFlag([SearchExpressionType.Number](Search.SearchExpressionType.Number.html)))
        {
            ++argIndex;
            takeNumber = Math.Max((int)(c.args[0].GetNumberValue(takeNumber)), 0);
        }
    
        for ( ; argIndex < c.args.Length; ++argIndex)
        {
            var iterable = c.args[argIndex].Execute(c);
            var taken = 0;
            foreach (var item in iterable)
            {
                if (item == null)
                    yield return null;
                else
                {
                    yield return item;
                    ++taken;
                    if (taken == takeNumber)
                    {
                        c.Break();
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    

### Properties

[args](Search.SearchExpressionContext-args.html)| Arguments of passed to the
SearchExpression being evaluated.  
---|---  
[expression](Search.SearchExpressionContext-expression.html)|
[[]SearchExpression] being evaluated.  
[items](Search.SearchExpressionContext-items.html)|  SearchItems yielded by
the evaluation of a searchExpression.  
[runtime](Search.SearchExpressionContext-runtime.html)|
SearchExpressionRuntime associated with this context. The runtime stores all
runtime data (stack frames, stack of contex and items) necessary for
evaluation of a SearchExpression.  
[search](Search.SearchExpressionContext-search.html)| SearchContex containing
the search query that was parsed to create the SearchExpression.  
[valid](Search.SearchExpressionContext-valid.html)| Is the current context
valid or not. If invalid it means the associated SearchExpression is null or
the SearchExiressionRuntime is invalid.  
  
### Public Methods

[Break](Search.SearchExpressionContext.Break.html)| Break the evaluation of a
SearchExpression meaning items won't be yielded anymore.  
---|---  
[Continue](Search.SearchExpressionContext.Continue.html)| Tell
SearchExpression evaluation to continue.  
[IsBreaking](Search.SearchExpressionContext.IsBreaking.html)| Has the current
context being flagged to break execution?  
[IsContinuing](Search.SearchExpressionContext.IsContinuing.html)| Has the
current context being flagged to continue execution?  
[ResetIterationControl](Search.SearchExpressionContext.ResetIterationControl.html)|
Restart evaluation and iteration of SearchExpression.  
[ResolveAlias](Search.SearchExpressionContext.ResolveAlias.html)| Try to
resolve an alias value using the SearchExpressionRuntime attached to this
context. Each frame if asked to resolve a SearchExpression.alias.  
[ThrowError](Search.SearchExpressionContext.ThrowError.html)| Stop a
SearchExpression evaluation by throwing a SearchExceptionEvaluatorException.
User writing an evaluator can decide to throw thse exceptions if the
parameters passed to evaluation are not valid or if a problem happens during
