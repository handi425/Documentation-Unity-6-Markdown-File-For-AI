## Declaration

public static void ApplyRemovedGameObject([GameObject](GameObject.html)
gameObjectInInstance, [GameObject](GameObject.html) assetGameObject,
[InteractionMode](InteractionMode.html) action);

### Parameters

gameObjectInInstance | A GameObject in the Prefab instance containing the removed GameObject.  
---|---  
assetGameObject | The GameObject in the Prefab Asset corresponding to the removed GameObject on the instance.  
action | The interaction mode for this action.  
  
### Description

Removes the GameObject from the source Prefab Asset.

When a GameObject is removed from a Prefab instance, that modification is a
type of [Instance Override](../Manual/PrefabInstanceOverrides.html). The act
of applying the change (the removal of the GameObject) to the Prefab means the
GameObject is removed from the Prefab Asset itself, along with its components
and GameObject children, and is no longer an override on the Prefab instance.  
  
When applying a removed GameObject to a Prefab Asset, you must supply the
asset path as a parameter. This is because there are some situations where
there are multiple possible targets to apply the change to. For example, if
the GameObject was removed from a GameObject that is part of a [nested
Prefab](../Manual/NestedPrefabs.html) instance, you may have the choice of
applying the change to the inner nested Prefab Asset, or to the outer root
Prefab Asset. Therefore, by specifying the asset path, you make it clear to
Unity which Prefab Asset the change must be applied to. It mirrors the
functionality in the editor, described in [the user manual
here](../Manual/PrefabOverridesMultiLevel.html).  
  
You can read more in the user manual about the [choice of apply
targets](../Manual/PrefabOverridesMultiLevel.html).
