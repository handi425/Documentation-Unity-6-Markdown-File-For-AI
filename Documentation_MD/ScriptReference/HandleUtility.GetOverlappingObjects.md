## Declaration

public static void GetOverlappingObjects([Vector2](Vector2.html) position,
List<Object> outObjectList);

### Parameters

position | The mouse position to test.  
---|---  
outObjectList | The list to hold the returned objects.  
  
### Description

Gets an ordered list of objects that would be picked under the give mouse
position.

The `position` argument specifies the test location in GUI coordinates.  
  
This function returns an unprocessed list of objects that could be either
GameObjects or Components. This list also doesn't take the [SelectionBase
attribute](UnityEngine.SelectionBaseAttribute.html) or prefab roots into
account.  
  
This function must be called during a Scene GUI event that is not
[Repaint](UnityEngine.EventType.Repaint.html). It only works with the current
[SceneView](SceneView.html).
