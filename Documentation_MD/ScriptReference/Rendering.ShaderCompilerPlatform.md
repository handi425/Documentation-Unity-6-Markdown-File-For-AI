### Description

Shader compiler used to generate player data shader variants.

In Unity, [shader programs](../Manual/SL-ShaderPrograms.html) are written in a
variant of [HLSL](../Manual/SL-ShadingLanguage.html) language.  
  
Each [platform](../Manual/PlatformSpecific.html) supports one or multiple
graphics APIs. For example, Vulkan and Direct3D 12 are both supported in
Windows. When building a standalone player, for each supported graphics API,
Unity runs a corresponding shader compiler which generates the shader variants
and cross-compiles the shader snippet into the shading language natively
supported by the graphics API.  
  
Additional resources:
[IPreprocessShaders.OnProcessShader](Build.IPreprocessShaders.OnProcessShader.html),
[Shader language](../Manual/SL-ShadingLanguage.html).
