## Declaration

public static EditorCurveBinding[]
GetCurveBindings([AnimationClip](AnimationClip.html) clip);

### Description

Retrieves the float curve bindings in an animation clip.

Unity has two types of animation: float curve and object reference curve. A
float curve is a classic curve that animates a float property over time. An
object reference curve is a construct that animates an object reference
property over time.  
  
This method returns the float curve bindings. See
[AnimationUtility.GetObjectReferenceCurveBindings](AnimationUtility.GetObjectReferenceCurveBindings.html)
for object reference curves.

    
    
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    // [Editor](Editor.html) window for listing all float curves in an animation clip
    public class ClipInfo : [EditorWindow](EditorWindow.html)
    {
        private [AnimationClip](AnimationClip.html) clip;  
      
        [[MenuItem](MenuItem.html)("Window/Clip Info")]
        static void Init()
        {
            GetWindow(typeof(ClipInfo));
        }  
      
        public void OnGUI()
        {
            clip = [EditorGUILayout.ObjectField](EditorGUILayout.ObjectField.html)("Clip", clip, typeof([AnimationClip](AnimationClip.html)), false) as [AnimationClip](AnimationClip.html);  
      
            [EditorGUILayout.LabelField](EditorGUILayout.LabelField.html)("Curves:");
            if (clip != null)
            {
                foreach (var binding in [AnimationUtility.GetCurveBindings](AnimationUtility.GetCurveBindings.html)(clip))
                {
                    [AnimationCurve](AnimationCurve.html) curve = [AnimationUtility.GetEditorCurve](AnimationUtility.GetEditorCurve.html)(clip, binding);
                    [EditorGUILayout.LabelField](EditorGUILayout.LabelField.html)(binding.path + "/" + binding.propertyName + ", Keys: " + curve.keys.Length);
                }
            }
        }
    }
