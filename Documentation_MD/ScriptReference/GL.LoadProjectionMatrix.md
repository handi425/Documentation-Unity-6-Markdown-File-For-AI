## Declaration

public static void LoadProjectionMatrix([Matrix4x4](Matrix4x4.html) mat);

### Description

Load an arbitrary matrix to the current projection matrix.

This function overrides current camera's projection parameters, so most often
you want to save and restore projection matrix using
[GL.PushMatrix](GL.PushMatrix.html) and [GL.PopMatrix](GL.PopMatrix.html). The
model and view matrix remain unchanged. Beware that the view matrix of the
camera typically performs a scaling of -1 along the z axis, which might have
to be taken into account depending on your use case.  
  
The loaded projection matrix is expected to project into the API-agnostic clip
volume defined by the following boundaries:  
**1.** x = -1..1 (left..right)  
**2.** y = -1..1 (bottom..top)  
**3.** z = -1..1 (near..far)  
  
Unity might combine the matrix with an additional transformation to map to the
convention of the actual graphics API. The resulting matrix can be obtained
through [GL.GetGPUProjectionMatrix](GL.GetGPUProjectionMatrix.html).

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        [Matrix4x4](Matrix4x4.html) projMtrx = [Matrix4x4.identity](Matrix4x4-identity.html);  
      
        void OnPostRender()
        {
            [GL.PushMatrix](GL.PushMatrix.html)();
            [GL.LoadProjectionMatrix](GL.LoadProjectionMatrix.html)(projMtrx);
            // Do your drawing here...
            [GL.PopMatrix](GL.PopMatrix.html)();
        }
    }
