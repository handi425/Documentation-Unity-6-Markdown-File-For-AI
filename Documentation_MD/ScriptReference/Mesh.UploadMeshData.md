## Declaration

public void UploadMeshData(bool markNoLongerReadable);

### Parameters

markNoLongerReadable | Frees up system memory copy of mesh data when set to `true`.  
---|---  
  
### Description

Upload previously done Mesh modifications to the graphics API.

When creating or modifying a Mesh from code (using [vertices](Mesh-
vertices.html), [normals](Mesh-normals.html), [triangles](Mesh-triangles.html)
etc. properties), the Mesh data is internally marked as "modified" and is sent
to the graphics API next time the Mesh is rendered.  
  
Call UploadMeshData to immediately send the modified data to the graphics API,
to avoid a possible problem later. Passing `true` in a `markNoLongerReadable`
argument makes Mesh data not be readable from the script anymore, and frees up
system memory copy of the data.

normals.html), [triangles](Mesh-triangles.html),
