public float angularDamping;

### Description

The angular damping of the Rigidbody2D angular velocity.

Damping can be used to reduce the
[Rigidbody2D.angularVelocity](Rigidbody2D-angularVelocity.html) (angular
speed) of a [Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) over time.  
  
Zero indicates that no damping should be used whereas higher values increase
the damping, effectively slowing down the rotational movement faster. Unlike
contact friction, angular damping is always applied.  
  
**Note:** The following formula is how the angular damping is applied
`angularVelocity *= 1.0f / ( 1.0f + simulation-time-step * angularDamping )`

    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        private [Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) rb;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            rb = GetComponent<[Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html)>();  
      
            // Start the object spining fast.
            rb.angularVelocity = 45f;  
      
            // Turn-off the angular damping.
            rb.angularDamping = 0f;
        }  
      
     
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            // Set a large angular damping to slow down the spin fast.
            if ([Input.GetKeyDown](Input.GetKeyDown.html)("space"))
                rb.angularDamping = 0.8f;
        }
    }
