rootMotionTransformName);

### Parameters

go | Root object of your transform hierarchy.

rootMotionTransformName | Transform name of the root motion transform. If empty no root motion is defined and you must take care of avatar movement yourself.

        {
            [GameObject](GameObject.html) activeGameObject = [Selection.activeGameObject](Selection-activeGameObject.html);  
      
            if (activeGameObject != null &&
                activeGameObject.GetComponent<[Animator](Animator.html)>() != null)
            {
                [Avatar](Avatar.html) avatar = [AvatarBuilder.BuildGenericAvatar](AvatarBuilder.BuildGenericAvatar.html)(activeGameObject, "");
                avatar.name = "InsertYourName";
                [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)(avatar.isHuman ? "is human" : "is generic");  
      
                [Animator](Animator.html) animator = activeGameObject.GetComponent<[Animator](Animator.html)>() as [Animator](Animator.html);
                animator.avatar = avatar;
            }
        }
    }
