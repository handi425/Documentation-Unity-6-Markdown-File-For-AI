Component in the Manual")

## Declaration

public void SetPosition(int index, [Vector3](Vector3.html) position);

### Parameters

index | Which position to set.  
---|---  
position | The new position.  
  
### Description

Set the position of a vertex in the trail.

You can only use this method to modify existing positions in the Trail. You
cannot use it to add new positions.  
  
When setting multiple positions, consider using
[SetPositions](TrailRenderer.SetPositions.html) instead because it is much
faster than making individual function calls for each position.  
  
Additional resources: [positionCount](TrailRenderer-positionCount.html)
property.
