## Declaration

public static void DrawRect([Rect](Rect.html) rect, [Color](Color.html)
color);

### Parameters

rect | The position and size of the rectangle to draw.  
---|---  
color | The color of the rectange.  
  
### Description

Draws a filled rectangle of color at the specified position and size within
the current editor window.

Use this to give blocks of Color to areas you want to highlight in the
Inspector window of a GameObject in the Editor. You can also use them to
simulate statistics in the Editor, for example, an in-Editor health bar.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);  
      
    public class EditorGUIDrawRectExample : [EditorWindow](EditorWindow.html)
    {
        //This is the value of the [Slider](UIElements.Slider.html)
        float m_Value = 50;  
      
        [[MenuItem](MenuItem.html)("Example/Draw [Rect](Rect.html)")]
        static void Init()
        {
            var window = (EditorGUIDrawRectExample)GetWindow(typeof(EditorGUIDrawRectExample));
            window.position = new [Rect](Rect.html)(0, 0, 350, 300);
        }  
      
        void OnGUI()
        {
            //This is the [Label](UIElements.Label.html) for the [Slider](UIElements.Slider.html)
            [GUI.Label](GUI.Label.html)(new [Rect](Rect.html)(0, 0, 100, 30), "Rectangle Width");
            //This is the [Slider](UIElements.Slider.html) that changes the size of the Rectangle drawn
            m_Value = [GUI.HorizontalSlider](GUI.HorizontalSlider.html)(new [Rect](Rect.html)(100, 0, 100, 30), m_Value, 1.0f, 250.0f);  
      
            //The rectangle is drawn in the [Editor](Editor.html) (when MyScript is attached) with the width depending on the value of the [Slider](UIElements.Slider.html)
            [EditorGUI.DrawRect](EditorGUI.DrawRect.html)(new [Rect](Rect.html)(50, 50, m_Value, 70), [Color.green](Color-green.html));
        }
    }
