## Declaration

public UxmlObjectReferenceAttribute(string uxmlName, params Type[]

### Parameters

uxmlName | The name of the nested UXML element that the UXML Objects are serialized to. **Note** : A null or empty value will result in the objects being serialized into the root.  
---|---  
acceptedTypes | In UI Builder, when adding a UXML Object to a field that has multiple derived types, a dropdown list appears with a selection of available types that can be added to the field. By default, this list comprises all types that inherit from the UXML object type. You can use a parameter to specify a list of accepted types to be displayed, rather than showing all available types.
