### Description

Base class for authoring data on a grid with grid painting tools like paint,
erase, pick, select and fill.

Inheriting this class and/or creating brush asset instances from your
inherited class, you can create custom brushes which react to high level grid
events like paint, erase, pick, select and fill.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    // Paints two Prefabs in checkerboard pattern
    [CreateAssetMenu]
    public class CheckerboardBrush : [GridBrushBase](GridBrushBase.html)
    {
        public [GameObject](GameObject.html) prefabA;
        public [GameObject](GameObject.html) prefabB;  
      
        public override void Paint([GridLayout](GridLayout.html) grid, [GameObject](GameObject.html) brushTarget, [Vector3Int](Vector3Int.html) position)
        {
            bool evenCell = [Mathf.Abs](Mathf.Abs.html)(position.y + position.x) % 2 > 0;
            [GameObject](GameObject.html) toBeInstantiated = evenCell ? prefabA : prefabB;  
      
            if (toBeInstantiated != null)
            {
                [GameObject](GameObject.html) newInstance = Instantiate(toBeInstantiated, grid.CellToWorld(position), [Quaternion.identity](Quaternion-identity.html));
                newInstance.transform.SetParent(brushTarget.transform);
            }
        }
    }
