public uint visibleCount;

### Description

The number of instances to draw with this draw command. This must be a value
greater than `1`.

If
[BatchDrawCommandFlags.HasSortingPosition](Rendering.BatchDrawCommandFlags.HasSortingPosition.html)
is set, you must set this to `1`. This is because Unity doesn't sort instances
within a draw command, it only sorts draw commands. This means that you must
place depth-sorted instances in separate draw commands.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
**Known Issue**. Please check with the Issue Tracker at
