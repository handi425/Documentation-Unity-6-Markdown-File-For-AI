## Declaration

public void SetAllVertices(Vertex[] vertices);

### Parameters

vertices | The array of vertices to copy from. The length of the array must match the allocated vertex count.  
---|---  
  
### Description

Fills the values of the allocated vertices with values copied directly from an
array. When this method is called, it is not possible to use SetNextVertex to
fill the allocated vertices array.

When this method is called, it is not possible to use SetNextVertex to fill
the vertices.

         void MyGenerateVisualContent([MeshGenerationContext](UIElements.MeshGenerationContext.html) mgc)
         {
             var meshWriteData = mgc.Allocate(4, 6);
             // meshWriteData has been allocated with 6 indices for 2 triangles  
      
             // ... set the vertices  
      
             // Set indices for the first triangle
             meshWriteData.SetNextIndex(0);
             meshWriteData.SetNextIndex(1);
             meshWriteData.SetNextIndex(2);  
      
             // Set indices for the second triangle
             meshWriteData.SetNextIndex(2);
             meshWriteData.SetNextIndex(1);
             meshWriteData.SetNextIndex(3);
