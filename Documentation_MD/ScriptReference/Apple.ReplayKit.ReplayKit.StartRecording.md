### Parameters

enableMicrophone | Enable or disable the microphone while making a recording. Enabling the microphone allows you to include user commentary while recording. The default value is false.  
---|---  
enableCamera | Enable or disable the camera while making a recording. Enabling camera allows you to include user camera footage while recording. The default value is false. To actually include camera footage in your recording, you also have to call ShowCameraPreviewAt as well to position the preview view.  
  
### Returns

**bool** A boolean value of True if recording started successfully or False if
an error occurred.

### Description

Start a new recording.

When StartRecording() is first called, an alert window displays asking the
user to confirm recording. The alert window displays again if 8 minutes or
more have passed since the last time StartRecording() was called.  
  
If ReplayKit.APIAvailable is false, this method does nothing and returns
false.
