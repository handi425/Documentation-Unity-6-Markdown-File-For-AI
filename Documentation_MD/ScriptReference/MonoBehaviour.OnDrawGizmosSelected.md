Component in the Manual")

### Description

Implement [OnDrawGizmosSelected](MonoBehaviour.OnDrawGizmosSelected.html) to
draw a gizmo if the object is selected.

[Gizmos](Gizmos.html) are drawn only when the object is selected. Gizmos are
not pickable. This is used to ease setup. For example an explosion script
could draw a sphere showing the explosion radius.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class GizmoTest : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public float explosionRadius = 5.0f;  
      
        void OnDrawGizmosSelected()
        {
            // [Display](Display.html) the explosion radius when selected
            [Gizmos.color](Gizmos-color.html) = new [Color](Color.html)(1, 1, 0, 0.75F);
            [Gizmos.DrawSphere](Gizmos.DrawSphere.html)(transform.position, explosionRadius);
        }
    }
