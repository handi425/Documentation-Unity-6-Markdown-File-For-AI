    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class SwapWeapon : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        protected [Animator](Animator.html) animator;
        protected [AnimatorOverrideController](AnimatorOverrideController.html) animatorOverrideController;  
      
        public void Start()
        {
            animator = GetComponent<[Animator](Animator.html)>();  
      
            animatorOverrideController = new [AnimatorOverrideController](AnimatorOverrideController.html)(animator.runtimeAnimatorController);
            animator.runtimeAnimatorController = animatorOverrideController;
        }
    }
