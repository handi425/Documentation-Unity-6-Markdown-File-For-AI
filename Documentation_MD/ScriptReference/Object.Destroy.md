[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-Object.html "Go to Object Component in the
Manual")

## Declaration

public static void Destroy([Object](Object.html) obj, float t = 0.0F);

### Parameters

obj | The object to destroy.  
---|---  
t | The optional amount of time to delay before destroying the object.  
  
### Description

Removes a GameObject, component or asset.

The object `obj` is destroyed immediately after the current Update loop, or
`t` seconds from now if a time is specified. If `obj` is a
[Component](Component.html), this method removes the component from the
[GameObject](GameObject.html) and destroys it. If `obj` is a
[GameObject](GameObject.html), it destroys the [GameObject](GameObject.html),
all its components and all transform children of the
[GameObject](GameObject.html). Actual object destruction is always delayed
until after the current Update loop, but is always done before rendering.  
  
Note: When destroying MonoBehaviour scripts, Unity calls OnDisable and
OnDestroy before the script is removed.

        void DestroyComponent()
        {
            // Removes the rigidbody from the game object
            Destroy(GetComponent<[Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html)>());
        }  
      
        void DestroyObjectDelayed()
        {
            // Kills the game object in 5 seconds after loading the object
            Destroy(gameObject, 5);
        }  
      
        // When the user presses Ctrl, it will remove the
        // [BoxCollider](BoxCollider.html) component from the game object
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            if ([Input.GetButton](Input.GetButton.html)("Fire1") && GetComponent<[BoxCollider](BoxCollider.html)>())
            {
                Destroy(GetComponent<[BoxCollider](BoxCollider.html)>());
            }
        }
    }
