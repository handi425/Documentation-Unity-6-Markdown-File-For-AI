[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-Camera.html "Go to Camera Component in the
Manual")

public static [Camera](Camera.html) main;

### Description

The first enabled Camera component that is tagged "MainCamera" (Read Only).

If there is no enabled Camera component with the "MainCamera" tag, this
property is null.  
  
Internally, Unity caches all GameObjects with the "MainCamera" tag. When you
access this property, Unity returns the first valid result from its cache.
Accessing this property has a small CPU overhead, comparable to calling
[GameObject.GetComponent](GameObject.GetComponent.html). Where CPU performance
is important, consider caching this property.
