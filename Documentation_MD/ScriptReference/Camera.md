### Description

A Camera is a device through which the player views the world.

A screen space point is defined in pixels. The bottom-left of the screen is
(0,0); the right-top is ([pixelWidth](Camera-
pixelWidth.html),[pixelHeight](Camera-pixelHeight.html)). The z position is in
world units from the Camera.  
  
A viewport space point is normalized and relative to the Camera. The bottom-
left of the Camera is (0,0); the top-right is (1,1). The z position is in
world units from the Camera.  
  
A world space point is defined in global coordinates (for example,
[Transform.position](Transform-position.html)).  
  
Additional resources: [camera component](../Manual/class-Camera.html).
