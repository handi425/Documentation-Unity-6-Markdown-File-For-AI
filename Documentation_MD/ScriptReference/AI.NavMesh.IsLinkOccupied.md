## Declaration

public static bool
IsLinkOccupied([AI.NavMeshLinkInstance](AI.NavMeshLinkInstance.html) handle);

### Parameters

handle | The link instance whose state to query.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**bool** True if an agent is currently traversing the link, otherwise false.

### Description

Determines whether or not a NavMesh agent is currently using this link.

Use this method to determine if your NavMesh agent can move onto the specified
NavMesh link instance. Only one NavMesh agent can traverse a NavMesh link
instance at any one time, so your agent can't move onto a NavMesh link
instance that is already occupied. A NavMesh link instance is occupied when
any NavMesh agent moves onto the link as part of the path the agent has
calculated to the [destination](AI.NavMeshAgent-destination.html). When the
agent moves off of the link, either automatically or through a call to
[NavMeshAgent.CompleteOffMeshLink](AI.NavMeshAgent.CompleteOffMeshLink.html),
the link instance is no longer occupied.  
  
This method is available as of 2023.2.
