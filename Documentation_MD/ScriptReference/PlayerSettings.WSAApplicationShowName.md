### Description

Options for which [tile types](PlayerSettings.WSAImageType.html) to display
the application name on.

Tiles you exclude using the property do not display the application name and
only display the logo image. There are no options that include the
[small](PlayerSettings.WSAImageType.UWPSquare71x71Logo.html) tile size because
this size can't display the application name.  
**Note:** If you do not set logo images for the corresponding tiles
([medium](PlayerSettings.WSAImageType.UWPSquare150x150Logo.html),
[large](PlayerSettings.WSAImageType.UWPSquare310x310Logo.html), and
[wide](PlayerSettings.WSAImageType.UWPWide310x150Logo.html)), the platform
ignores the tiles and does not display the application name. **Important:**
Unity writes these settings to the package manifest when it builds Universal
Windows Platform for the first time. Building into an existing Universal
Windows Platform build folder does not update the package manifest and does
not apply any changes. Additional resources:
[tileShowName](PlayerSettings.WSA-tileShowName.html)

### Properties

[NotSet](PlayerSettings.WSAApplicationShowName.NotSet.html)| Indicates that
you have not set the application name and to use the default Universal Windows
Platform behavior.  
---|---  
[AllLogos](PlayerSettings.WSAApplicationShowName.AllLogos.html)| Displays the
application name on all tile sizes.  
[NoLogos](PlayerSettings.WSAApplicationShowName.NoLogos.html)| Doesn't display
the application name on any tile size.  
[StandardLogoOnly](PlayerSettings.WSAApplicationShowName.StandardLogoOnly.html)|
Displays the application name for medium and large tiles.  
[WideLogoOnly](PlayerSettings.WSAApplicationShowName.WideLogoOnly.html)|
Displays the application name for the wide tiles.
