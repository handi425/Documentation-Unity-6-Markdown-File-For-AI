public [Collider2D.CompositeOperation](Collider2D.CompositeOperation.html)
compositeOperation;

### Description

The composite operation to be used by a
[CompositeCollider2D](CompositeCollider2D.html).

A [CompositeCollider2D](CompositeCollider2D.html) is used when the composite
operation is anything other than
[Collider2D.CompositeOperation.None](Collider2D.CompositeOperation.None.html).  
  
When a [CompositeCollider2D](CompositeCollider2D.html) is used, the Collider
geometry is merged together using this composite operation with any other
Colliders using the same [CompositeCollider2D](CompositeCollider2D.html). The
composite operation order is controlled with
[Collider2D.compositeOrder](Collider2D-compositeOrder.html).  
  
**NOTE:** When a [CompositeCollider2D](CompositeCollider2D.html) is used, the
Editor will ignore and not show the
[Collider2D.sharedMaterial](Collider2D-sharedMaterial.html),
[Collider2D.isTrigger](Collider2D-isTrigger.html) &
[Collider2D.usedByEffector](Collider2D-usedByEffector.html) properties. The
same properties on the [CompositeCollider2D](CompositeCollider2D.html) will be
used instead. You should set these properties on the
[CompositeCollider2D](CompositeCollider2D.html) instead. Also, this property
is only available with the [BoxCollider2D](BoxCollider2D.html),
[PolygonCollider2D](PolygonCollider2D.html),
[CircleCollider2D](CircleCollider2D.html) and
[CapsuleCollider2D](CapsuleCollider2D.html).  
  
Additional resources:
[Collider2D.compositeOperation](Collider2D-compositeOperation.html),
[Collider2D.compositeOrder](Collider2D-compositeOrder.html) and
[CompositeCollider2D](CompositeCollider2D.html).
