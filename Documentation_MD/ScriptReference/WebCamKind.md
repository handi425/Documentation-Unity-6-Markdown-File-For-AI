### Description

Enum representing the different types of web camera device.

On iOS devices, the [WebCamDevice.kind](WebCamDevice-kind.html) is reported
directly by the hardware. On Android devices, the hardware does not report
this value, so Unity determines the [WebCamDevice.kind](WebCamDevice-
kind.html) by calculating the [Equivalent Focal
Length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/35_mm_equivalent_focal_length) from a
calculation based on the reported focal length and matrix size. Therefore, on
some Android devices, the default camera may be detected as
[WebCamKind.UltraWideAngle](WebCamKind.UltraWideAngle.html) or
[WebCamKind.Telephoto](WebCamKind.Telephoto.html). As there is currently no
web API that returns the focal length of a webcam device, the WebGL
applications always return [WebCamDevice.kind](WebCamDevice-kind.html) as
WideAngle.  
  
Additional resources: [WebCamDevice.kind](WebCamDevice-kind.html).

### Properties

[Unknown](WebCamKind.Unknown.html)| The camera type is unknown.  
---|---  
[WideAngle](WebCamKind.WideAngle.html)| Wide angle (default) camera.  
[Telephoto](WebCamKind.Telephoto.html)| A Telephoto camera device. These
devices have a longer focal length than a wide-angle camera.  
[ColorAndDepth](WebCamKind.ColorAndDepth.html)| Camera which supports
synchronized color and depth data (currently these are only dual back and true
depth cameras on latest iOS devices).  
[UltraWideAngle](WebCamKind.UltraWideAngle.html)| Ultra wide angle camera.
These devices have a shorter focal length than a wide-angle camera.
