public float maxTorque;

### Description

The maximum torque that can be generated when trying to maintain the friction
joint constraint.

The joint constantly tries to reduce the ::Rigidbody2D::angularVelocity using
the maximum torque. Because you can use very high torque limit, you can
essentially reduce an objects rotation to almost zero.  
  
Additional resources: [maxForce](FrictionJoint2D-maxForce.html),
::Rigidbody2D::angularVelocity.
