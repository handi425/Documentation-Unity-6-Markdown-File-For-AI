## Declaration

public static bool GetKeyDown(string name);

### Description

Returns true during the frame the user starts pressing down the key identified
by `name`.

**Note: This API is part of the legacy** `Input` **class, and not recommended
for new projects. The documentation is provided here to support legacy
projects that use the old Input Manager and Input class. For new projects you
should use the newer and Input System Package**. ([read
more](../Manual/Input.html)).  
  
Call this function from the [Update](MonoBehaviour.Update.html) function,
since the state gets reset each frame. It will not return true until the user
has released the key and pressed it again.  
  
For the list of key identifiers see [Conventional Game
Input](../Manual/ConventionalGameInput.html). When dealing with input it is
recommended to use [Input.GetAxis](Input.GetAxis.html) and
[Input.GetButton](Input.GetButton.html) instead since it allows end-users to
configure the keys.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            if ([Input.GetKeyDown](Input.GetKeyDown.html)("space"))
            {
                [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("space key was pressed");
            }
        }
    }

## Declaration

public static bool GetKeyDown([KeyCode](KeyCode.html) key);

### Description

Returns true during the frame the user starts pressing down the key identified
by the `key` [KeyCode](KeyCode.html) enum parameter.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            if ([Input.GetKeyDown](Input.GetKeyDown.html)([KeyCode.Space](KeyCode.Space.html)))
            {
                [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("space key was pressed");
            }
        }
    }
