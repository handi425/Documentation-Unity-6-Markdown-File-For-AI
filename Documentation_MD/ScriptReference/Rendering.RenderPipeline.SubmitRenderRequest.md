## Declaration

public static void SubmitRenderRequest([Camera](Camera.html) camera,
RequestData data);

### Description

Submit a renderRequest.

This triggers a pipeline render determined by the RequestData type. Use
ScriptableRenderer.SupportsRenderRequest to check if the active RenderPipeline
supports this RequestData type.  
  
The UniversalRenderPipeline supports:

  * ScriptableRenderer.StandardRequest, which renders a full URP camera stack and outputs the result to the given target. Can only be called on Base Cameras.
  * UniversalRenderPipeline.SingleCameraRequest, which renders a single URP camera and outputs the result to the given target.

The HDRenderPipeline supports ScriptableRenderer.StandardRequest, which
renders a single HDRP camera without [Arbitrary Output
Variables](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-
definition@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/AOVs.html) (AOVs) and outputs
the result to the given target. It uses a separate camera history from the
render loop, to ensure temporal effects are consistent.  
  
Refer to [Render requests](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-
pipelines.core@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/User-Render-Requests.html)
for more information about render requests in scriptable render pipelines
(SRPs).
