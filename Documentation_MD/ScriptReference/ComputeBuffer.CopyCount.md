## Declaration

public static void CopyCount([ComputeBuffer](ComputeBuffer.html) src,
[ComputeBuffer](ComputeBuffer.html) dst, int dstOffsetBytes);

### Parameters

src | Append/consume buffer to copy the counter from.  
---|---  
dst | A buffer to copy the counter to.  
dstOffsetBytes | Target byte offset in `dst`.  
  
### Description

Copy counter value of append/consume buffer into another buffer.

Append/consume and counter buffers (see
[ComputeBufferType.Append](ComputeBufferType.Append.html),
[ComputeBufferType.Counter](ComputeBufferType.Counter.html)) keep track of the
number of elements in them with a special counter variable. CopyCount takes a
buffer as `src`, and copies its counter value into `dst` buffer at given byte
offset.  
  
This is most commonly used in conjunction with
[Graphics.DrawProceduralIndirect](Graphics.DrawProceduralIndirect.html), to
render arbitrary number of primitives without reading their count back to the
CPU.  
  
On DX11 there is a restriction on the `dst` buffer - it must have been created
with [ComputeBufferType.Raw](ComputeBufferType.Raw.html) or
[ComputeBufferType.IndirectArguments](ComputeBufferType.IndirectArguments.html)
type. On other platforms `dst` can be any type.  
  
Additional resources: [SetCounterValue](ComputeBuffer.SetCounterValue.html).
