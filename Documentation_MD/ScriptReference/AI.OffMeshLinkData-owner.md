public Object owner;

### Description

Get the object used to create the NavMesh link represented by the data in this
struct.

If the link has been instantiated by a call to
[NavMesh.AddLink](AI.NavMesh.AddLink.html) then this property returns the
object that might have been associated to that instance with a call to
[NavMesh.SetLinkOwner](AI.NavMesh.SetLinkOwner.html). If that link instance
has no owner assigned to it then this property returns null.  
If the link was instantiated by an OffMeshLink component then the owner
returns a reference to that component.  
To effectively use this property in your scripts you need to determine the
exact type of the returned object. To do that cast the object to the types
that you use in your project to create NavMesh links.  
For automatically-generated Jump or Drop links, this property returns null.
