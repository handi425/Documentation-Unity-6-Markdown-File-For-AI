## Declaration

public static bool GenerateSecondaryUVSet([Mesh](Mesh.html) src);

## Declaration

public static bool GenerateSecondaryUVSet([Mesh](Mesh.html) src,
[UnwrapParam](UnwrapParam.html) settings);

### Parameters

src | The Mesh to update.  
---|---  
settings | Settings that configure the calculation.  
  
### Returns

**bool** Returns true if the calculation succeeded. Otherwise, returns false.

### Description

Compute a unique UV layout for a Mesh, and store it in [Mesh.uv2](Mesh-
uv2.html).

When you import a model asset, you can instruct Unity to compute a lightmap UV
layout for it using [[ModelImporter-generateSecondaryUV]] or the [Model Import
Settings Inspector](../Manual/class-FBXImporter.html). This function allows
you to do the same to procedurally generated meshes.  
  
If this process requires multiple UV charts to flatten the the mesh, the mesh
might contain more vertices than before. If the mesh uses 16-bit indices (see
[Mesh.indexFormat](Mesh-indexFormat.html)) and the process would result in
more vertices than are possible to use with 16-bit indices, this function
fails and returns `false`.  
  
Additional resources: [Mesh](Mesh.html) class,
[ModelImporter](ModelImporter.html) class, [Generating Lightmap
UVs](../Manual/LightingGiUvs-GeneratingLightmappingUVs.html).
