## Declaration

public static bool IsNativeAsset(int instanceID);

### Description

Determines whether the Asset is a native Asset.

A native Asset is a file produced directly by Unity's serialization system
(for example, a .mat Material file is a native Asset)  
  
Note that scenes, prefabs and assembly definitions are not considered to be
native assets.

        static void ListNativeFiles()
        {
            //List all native assets in the project

                var asset = [AssetDatabase.LoadMainAssetAtPath](AssetDatabase.LoadMainAssetAtPath.html)(path);
