Manual")

public [Camera.MonoOrStereoscopicEye](Camera.MonoOrStereoscopicEye.html)
stereoActiveEye;

### Description

Returns the eye that is currently rendering. If called when stereo is not
enabled it will return
[Camera.MonoOrStereoscopicEye.Mono](Camera.MonoOrStereoscopicEye.Mono.html).  
If called during a camera rendering callback such as
[OnRenderImage](Camera.OnRenderImage.html) it will return the currently
rendering eye.  
If called outside of a rendering callback and stereo is enabled, it will
return the default eye which is
[Camera.MonoOrStereoscopicEye.Left](Camera.MonoOrStereoscopicEye.Left.html).
