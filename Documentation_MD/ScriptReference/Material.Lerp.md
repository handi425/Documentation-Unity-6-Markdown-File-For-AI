## Declaration

public void Lerp([Material](Material.html) start, [Material](Material.html)
end, float t);

### Description

Interpolate properties between two materials.

Makes all color and float values of a material be interpolated from `start` to
`end`, based on `t`.  
When `t` is 0, all values are taken from `start`.  
When `t` is 1, all values are taken from `end`.  
  
Most often you want the materials that are interpolated between to be the same
(use the same shaders and textures) except for colors and floats. Then you use
`Lerp` to blend between them.

    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        // Blends between two materials  
      
        [Material](Material.html) material1;
        [Material](Material.html) material2;
        float duration = 2.0f;
        [Renderer](Renderer.html) rend;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            rend = GetComponent<[Renderer](Renderer.html)> ();  
      
            // At start, use the first material
            rend.material = material1;
        }  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            // ping-pong between the materials over the duration
            float lerp = [Mathf.PingPong](Mathf.PingPong.html)([Time.time](Time-time.html), duration) / duration;
            rend.material.Lerp(material1, material2, lerp);
        }
    }
