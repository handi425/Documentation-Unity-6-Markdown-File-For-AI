## Declaration

public [Vector3](Vector3.html) WorldToViewportPoint([Vector3](Vector3.html)
position);

## Declaration

public [Vector3](Vector3.html) WorldToViewportPoint([Vector3](Vector3.html)
position, [Camera.MonoOrStereoscopicEye](Camera.MonoOrStereoscopicEye.html)
eye);

### Parameters

position | A 3D point in world space.  
---|---  
eye | Optional argument that can be used to specify which eye transform to use. Default is Mono.  
  
### Description

Transforms `position` from world space into viewport space.

Viewport space is normalized and relative to the camera. The bottom-left of
the camera is (0,0); the top-right is (1,1). The z position is in world units
from the camera.

    
    
    // Finds out whether target is on the left or right side of the screen
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public [Transform](Transform.html) target;
        [Camera](Camera.html) cam;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            cam = GetComponent<[Camera](Camera.html)>();
        }  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            [Vector3](Vector3.html) viewPos = cam.WorldToViewportPoint(target.position);
            if (viewPos.x > 0.5F)
                print("target is on the right side!");
            else
                print("target is on the left side!");
        }
    }
