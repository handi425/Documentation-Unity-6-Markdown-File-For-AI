fileTypeAssociations;

### Description

The [file types](PlayerSettings.WSAFileTypeAssociations.html) to register the
application as a default handler for.

If you set file associations, Windows can automatically launch your
application when the user opens an associated file type.  
If you register the application as a file type handle, then it also [handles
file activation events](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/launch-
resume/handle-file-activation#step-3-handle-the-activated-event).  
In the Editor, Unity displays this under **File and Protocol Associations** in
[UWP Player Settings](../Manual/class-PlayerSettingsWSA.html). For information
on Windows file type association, see [Microsoft's
documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/shell/fa-intro).
