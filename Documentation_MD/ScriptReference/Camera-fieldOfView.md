[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-Camera.html "Go to Camera Component in the
Manual")

public float fieldOfView;

### Description

The vertical field of view of the Camera, in degrees.

This is the vertical field of view; horizontal field of view depends on the
viewport's aspect ratio. For for more information, see
[VerticalToHorizontalFieldOfView](Camera.VerticalToHorizontalFieldOfView.html).  
  
If [Camera.orthographic](Camera-orthographic.html) is `true`, the Camera
ignores `fieldOfView`.  
  
Some VR SDKs have fixed field of view values that are used for VR cameras.
When VR is enabled with those SDKs, this property will always return the value
from the SDK. You will see a warning logged if you attempt to set the property
and the value will be ignored.  
  
If you make changes to [Camera.projectionMatrix](Camera-
projectionMatrix.html), the Camera ignores `fieldOfView`. This lasts until you
call [Camera.ResetProjectionMatrix](Camera.ResetProjectionMatrix.html).  
  
In the Unity Editor, this corresponds to the **Clipping Planes: Near**
property in the Camera component Inspector.  
  
Additional resources: [Camera Inspector reference](../Manual/class-
Camera.html).

    
    
    //Attach this script to an empty [GameObject](GameObject.html).
    //This script creates a [Slider](UIElements.Slider.html) that allows you to manipulate the [Camera](Camera.html)'s field of view. Place GameObjects in the [Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html) to show the full effect.  
      
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class CameraFieldOfViewExample : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        //This is the field of view that the [Camera](Camera.html) has
        float m_FieldOfView;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            //Start the [Camera](Camera.html) field of view at 60
            m_FieldOfView = 60.0f;
        }  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            //[Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html) the camera's field of view to be the variable returning from the [Slider](UIElements.Slider.html)
            Camera.main.fieldOfView = m_FieldOfView;
        }  
      
        void OnGUI()
        {
            //Set up the maximum and minimum values the [Slider](UIElements.Slider.html) can return (you can change these)
            float max, min;
            max = 150.0f;
            min = 20.0f;
            //This [Slider](UIElements.Slider.html) changes the field of view of the [Camera](Camera.html) between the minimum and maximum values
            m_FieldOfView = [GUI.HorizontalSlider](GUI.HorizontalSlider.html)(new [Rect](Rect.html)(20, 20, 100, 40), m_FieldOfView, min, max);
        }
    }
