## Declaration

public T As();

### Returns

**T** Returns the basic geometric shape which is stored in the GeometryHolder.

### Description

Return the specified geometric shape stored inside this Geometry Holder
object.

This function throws an InvalidOperationException if you try to request a
geometric shape that is not stored in the GeometryHolder.  
  
In the case of [CapsuleGeometry](LowLevelPhysics.CapsuleGeometry.html), when
Unity retrieves the shape from a [CapsuleCollider](CapsuleCollider.html)
component, the [CapsuleCollider.direction](CapsuleCollider-direction.html) is
not included. For this reason, you should assume the direction is always along
the X axis.
