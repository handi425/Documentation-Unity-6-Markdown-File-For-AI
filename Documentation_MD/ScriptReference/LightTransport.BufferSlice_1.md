### Description

Unity uses the BufferSlice struct to split one large buffer allocation into
one or more smaller buffers, each with explicit types.

### Properties

[Id](LightTransport.BufferSlice_1.Id.html)| Buffer ID.  
---|---  
[Offset](LightTransport.BufferSlice_1.Offset.html)| The number of elements to
offset, measured from the beginning of the buffer. The value must not exceed
the end of the buffer allocation.  
  
### Constructors

[BufferSlice_1](LightTransport.BufferSlice_1-ctor.html)| Construct a new
BufferSlice struct by defining an offset from the beginning of a buffer. The
buffer is defined by the BufferID.  
---|---  
  
### Public Methods

[SafeReinterpret](LightTransport.BufferSlice_1.SafeReinterpret.html)|
Reinterpret the slice as having a different data type (type punning),
performing checks to ensure the reinterpret is valid.  
---|---  
[UnsafeReinterpret](LightTransport.BufferSlice_1.UnsafeReinterpret.html)|
Reinterpret the slice as having a different data type (type punning), but does
not check if the reinterpret is valid.
