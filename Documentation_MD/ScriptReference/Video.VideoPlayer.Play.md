## Declaration

public void Play();

### Description

Starts or resumes the playback of a video.

If the video isn't prepared, this method will prepare the video before it
starts playback, but playback won't be instant. To make playback instant, use
[VideoPlayer.Prepare](Video.VideoPlayer.Prepare.html) and wait for preparation
to finish (when [VideoPlayer.prepareCompleted](Video.VideoPlayer-
prepareCompleted.html) fires), before you use this method.  
  
If you use [VideoPlayer.Prepare](Video.VideoPlayer.Prepare.html) and then play
the video before preparation finishes, the VideoPlayer will finish preparation
and then play the video.

isPlaying.html), [VideoPlayer.Pause](Video.VideoPlayer.Pause.html),
[VideoPlayer.started](Video.VideoPlayer-started.html).
