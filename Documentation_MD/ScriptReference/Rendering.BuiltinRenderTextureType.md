### Description

Built-in temporary render textures produced during camera's rendering.

When camera is rendering the Scene, in some cases it can produce temporary
render textures in the process (e.g. depth textures, deferred G-buffer etc.).
This enum indicates these temporary render textures.  
  
BuiltinRenderTextureType can be used as a
[RenderTargetIdentifier](Rendering.RenderTargetIdentifier.html) in some
functions of [CommandBuffer](Rendering.CommandBuffer.html).  
  
Additional resources: [CommandBuffer](Rendering.CommandBuffer.html),
[RenderTargetIdentifier](Rendering.RenderTargetIdentifier.html).

### Properties

[PropertyName](Rendering.BuiltinRenderTextureType.PropertyName.html)| A
globally set property name.  
---|---  
[BufferPtr](Rendering.BuiltinRenderTextureType.BufferPtr.html)| The raw
RenderBuffer pointer to be used.  
[RenderTexture](Rendering.BuiltinRenderTextureType.RenderTexture.html)| The
given RenderTexture.  
[CurrentActive](Rendering.BuiltinRenderTextureType.CurrentActive.html)|
Currently active render target.  
[CameraTarget](Rendering.BuiltinRenderTextureType.CameraTarget.html)| Target
texture of currently rendering camera.  
[Depth](Rendering.BuiltinRenderTextureType.Depth.html)| Camera's depth
texture.  
[DepthNormals](Rendering.BuiltinRenderTextureType.DepthNormals.html)| Camera's
depth+normals texture.  
[ResolvedDepth](Rendering.BuiltinRenderTextureType.ResolvedDepth.html)|
Resolved depth buffer from deferred.  
[GBuffer0](Rendering.BuiltinRenderTextureType.GBuffer0.html)| Deferred shading
G-buffer #0 (typically diffuse color).  
[GBuffer1](Rendering.BuiltinRenderTextureType.GBuffer1.html)| Deferred shading
G-buffer #1 (typically specular + roughness).  
[GBuffer2](Rendering.BuiltinRenderTextureType.GBuffer2.html)| Deferred shading
G-buffer #2 (typically normals).  
[GBuffer3](Rendering.BuiltinRenderTextureType.GBuffer3.html)| Deferred shading
G-buffer #3 (typically emission/lighting).  
[Reflections](Rendering.BuiltinRenderTextureType.Reflections.html)|
Reflections gathered from default reflection and reflections probes.  
[MotionVectors](Rendering.BuiltinRenderTextureType.MotionVectors.html)| Motion
Vectors generated when the camera has motion vectors enabled.  
[GBuffer4](Rendering.BuiltinRenderTextureType.GBuffer4.html)| Deferred shading
G-buffer #4 (typically occlusion mask for static lights if any).  
[GBuffer5](Rendering.BuiltinRenderTextureType.GBuffer5.html)| G-buffer #5
Available.  
[GBuffer6](Rendering.BuiltinRenderTextureType.GBuffer6.html)| G-buffer #6
Available.  
[GBuffer7](Rendering.BuiltinRenderTextureType.GBuffer7.html)| G-buffer #7
Available.
