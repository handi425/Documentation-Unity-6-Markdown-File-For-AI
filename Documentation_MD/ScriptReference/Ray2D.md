### Description

A ray in 2D space.

A _ray_ is a line segment that extends from a point in space in a specified
direction. Rays have a number of uses in Unity but the most common is probably
_raycasting_. This technique involves tracing along the path of a ray from its
origin to determine if it intersects with any objects. This is useful for
plotting the paths of projectiles, determining lines of sight and implementing
many common game mechanics.
