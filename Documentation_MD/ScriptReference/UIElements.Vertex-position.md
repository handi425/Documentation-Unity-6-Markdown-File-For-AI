public [Vector3](Vector3.html) position;

### Description

Describes the vertex's position.

Note this value is a [Vector3](Vector3.html). If the vertex represents flat UI
geometry, set the z component of this position field to
[Vertex.nearZ](UIElements.Vertex-nearZ.html). The position value is relative
to the [VisualElement](UIElements.VisualElement.html)'s local rectangle top-
left corner. The coordinate system is X+ to the right, and Y+ goes down. The
unit of position is [VisualElement](UIElements.VisualElement.html) points.
When the vertices are indexed, the triangles described must follow clock-wise
winding order given that Y+ goes down.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
**Known Issue**. Please check with the Issue Tracker at
