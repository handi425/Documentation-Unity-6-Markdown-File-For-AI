[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-ScriptableObject.html "Go to
ScriptableObject Component in the Manual")

### Description

Called when an instance of `ScriptableObject` is created.

`Awake` is called when a new instance of a `ScriptableObject` is created.
Scenarios in which this happens include:

  * A new `ScriptableObject` is created as an asset via the [Create Asset menu](CreateAssetMenuAttribute.html) in the Editor
  * A new `ScriptableObject` is created programmatically using [ScriptableObject.CreateInstance](ScriptableObject.CreateInstance.html)
  * A `ScriptableObject` is loaded from an [AssetBundle](AssetBundle.html) at runtime
  * A scene which contains a reference to the `ScriptableObject` asset is loaded in the [Hierarchy window](../Manual/Hierarchy.html) for the first time, or on subsequent loads if the original instance has since been cleaned up by [Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets](Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets.html)
  * The `ScriptableObject` asset is selected in the [Project window](../Manual/ProjectView.html) for the first time, or on subsequent selections if the original instance has since been cleaned up by [Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets](Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets.html)

**Note** : ScriptableObjects created as assets in Edit mode are not recreated
on entering Play mode. To perform initialization work in a `ScriptableObject`
on entering Play mode, use
[ScriptableObject.OnEnable](ScriptableObject.OnEnable.html) instead.  
  
An example is given below. This example has two scripts. The first shown is
the [ScriptableObject](ScriptableObject.html) script. This implements code
which is separate from [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html). The second is a
small [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html) related script which accesses values
from the ScriptableObject script.

    
    
    // A [ScriptableObject](ScriptableObject.html) example script.
    // The A and B members implement features which
    // are unrelated to [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html).  
      
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class ScriptObj : [ScriptableObject](ScriptableObject.html)
    {
        int a = 10;
        int[] b = new int[5] {0, 17, 34, 42, 67};  
      
        public int A
        {
            get {return a; }
        }  
      
        // return value in b array, or -1 if x is out-of-range
        public int B(int x)
        {
            if (x >= 0 && x < 5)
                return b[x];
            else
                return -1;
        }  
      
        public void Awake()
        {
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("Awake");
        }  
      
        public void OnDestroy()
        {
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("OnDestroy");
        }
    }
    

The following script makes use of the above ScriptableObject script.

    
    
    // create and access the ScriptObj  
      
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class ScriptObjExample : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        ScriptObj test;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            test = (ScriptObj)[ScriptableObject.CreateInstance](ScriptableObject.CreateInstance.html)(typeof(ScriptObj));  
      
            print(test.A);
            print(test.B(3));
            print(test.B(-3));
        }
    }
