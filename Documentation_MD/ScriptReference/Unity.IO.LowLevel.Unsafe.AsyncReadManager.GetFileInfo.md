## Declaration

public static
[Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.ReadHandle](Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.ReadHandle.html)
GetFileInfo(string filename, FileInfoResult* result);

### Parameters

filename | The name of the file to query.  
---|---  
result | A struct that this function fills in with information about the file upon completion of this asynchronous request.  
  
### Returns

**ReadHandle** A read handle that you can use to monitor the progress and
status of this GetFileInfo command.

### Description

Gets information about a file.

This function gets information about the specified file asynchronously without
opening the file. On completion of the asynchronous operation, the `result`
parameter's
[FileInfoResult.FileState](Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.FileInfoResult.FileState.html)
member reports whether the file exists
([FileState.Exists](Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.FileState.Exists.html)) or not
([FileState.Absent](Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.FileState.Absent.html)). If the
file exists, the `result` parameter's
[FileInfoResult.FileSize](Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.FileInfoResult.FileSize.html)
member reports the size of the file in bytes. If the file is absent, the size
is reported as zero.
