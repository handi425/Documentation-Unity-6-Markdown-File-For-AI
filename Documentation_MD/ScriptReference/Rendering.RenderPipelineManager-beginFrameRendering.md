### Description

Delegate that you can use to invoke custom code at the start of
[RenderPipeline.Render](Rendering.RenderPipeline.Render.html).

This delegate is replaced by
[RenderPipelineManager.beginContextRendering](Rendering.RenderPipelineManager-
beginContextRendering.html). It is supported and documented for backwards
compatibility only.  
  
When Unity calls
[RenderPipeline.BeginFrameRendering](Rendering.RenderPipeline.BeginFrameRendering.html),
it executes the methods in this delegate's invocation list. If you are writing
a custom Scriptable Render Pipeline, you can call this method at the start of
[RenderPipeline.Render](Rendering.RenderPipeline.Render.html).  
  
Using this delegate causes heap allocations. Using
[RenderPipeline.BeginContextRendering](Rendering.RenderPipeline.BeginContextRendering.html)
and the
[RenderPipelineManager.beginContextRendering](Rendering.RenderPipelineManager-
beginContextRendering.html) delegate provide the same functionality, but
without unnecessary heap allocations. You should use them instead.
