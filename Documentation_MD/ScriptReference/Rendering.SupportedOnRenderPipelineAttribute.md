### Description

Set which render pipelines make a class active.

Add `[SupportedOnRenderPipeline]` above a class to set which [Render Pipeline
Assets](Rendering.RenderPipelineAsset.html) make a class active. For example,
`[SupportedOnRenderPipeline(typeof(HDRenderPipelineAsset))`.  
  
`[SupportedOnRenderPipeline]` works only with some attributes - for example,
[CustomEditor](CustomEditor.html). You can use `[SupportedOnRenderPipeline]`
without an argument if you want all [Scriptable Render
Pipeline](../Manual/ScriptableRenderPipeline.html) Assets to make the class
active. The following example makes the `BehaviourEditor` class active when
any Scriptable Render Pipeline asset is active.

    
    
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.Rendering;  
      
    [[CustomEditor](CustomEditor.html)(typeof([Behaviour](Behaviour.html)))]
    [SupportedOnRenderPipeline]
    public class BehaviourEditor : [Editor](Editor.html)
    {
        public override void OnInspectorGUI()
        {
            [EditorGUILayout.LabelField](EditorGUILayout.LabelField.html)($"{nameof(BehaviourEditor)} is supported on the currently active render pipeline.");
        }
    }  
      
    public class [Behaviour](Behaviour.html) : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
    }
