public [ColorSpace](ColorSpace.html) colorSpace;

### Description

Indicates the color space that the gradient color keys are using.

Color space setting is automatically set up by the gradient editor, based on
[GradientUsageAttribute.colorSpace](GradientUsageAttribute-colorSpace.html)
value.  
  
If you are creating gradients from C# code, this value needs to be set
manually. Default value assumes that [colorKeys](Gradient-colorKeys.html) are
expressed in [Gamma](ColorSpace.Gamma.html) sRGB. Set this to
[Linear](ColorSpace.Linear.html) if color keys are expressed as linear values.  
  
Currently only the
[GradientMode.PerceptualBlend](GradientMode.PerceptualBlend.html) mode needs
to know the color space; the value is ignored for other modes.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
