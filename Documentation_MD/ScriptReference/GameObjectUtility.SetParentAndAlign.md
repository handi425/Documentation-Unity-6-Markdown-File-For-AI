## Declaration

public static void SetParentAndAlign([GameObject](GameObject.html) child,
[GameObject](GameObject.html) parent);

### Parameters

child | The GameObject that should have a new parent set.  
---|---  
parent | The GameObject that the child should get as a parent and have position and layer copied from. If null, this function does nothing.  
  
### Description

Sets the parent and gives the child the same layer and position.

This is intended as a utility function when creating custom GameObjects with a
[MenuItem](MenuItem.html) in the "GameObject/" menu. When using the context
click menu to create new GameObjects in the Scene hierarchy, the newly created
GameObjects should be parented to the clicked GameObject, which is passed in
as [MenuCommand.context](MenuCommand-context.html). Calling this method
ensures this behavior in the case of a context click while doing nothing if
the context is null (see example on the [MenuItem](MenuItem.html) docs).
