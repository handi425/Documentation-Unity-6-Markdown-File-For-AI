## Declaration

public static [Unity.Jobs.JobHandle](Unity.Jobs.JobHandle.html)
ScheduleReadOnly(T jobData,
[Jobs.TransformAccessArray](Jobs.TransformAccessArray.html) transforms, int
batchSize, [Unity.Jobs.JobHandle](Unity.Jobs.JobHandle.html) dependsOn);

### Parameters

jobData | The job to schedule.  
---|---  
transforms | The [TransformAccessArray](Jobs.TransformAccessArray.html) to run the job on.  
batchSize | Granularity in which workstealing is performed. For example, a value of 32 means the job queue will steal 32 iterations and then perform them in an efficient inner loop.  
dependsOn | A JobHandle containing any jobs that must finish executing before this job begins. You can combine multiple jobs with [JobHandle.CombineDependencies](Unity.Jobs.JobHandle.CombineDependencies.html). Use dependencies to ensure that two jobs that read or write to the same data don't run in parallel.  
  
### Returns

**JobHandle** The handle identifying the scheduled job, which you can use as a
dependency for a later job or to ensure completion on the main thread.

### Description

Schedules an [IJobParallelForTransform](Jobs.IJobParallelForTransform.html)
job with read-only access to the transform data.

This method provides better parallelization because it can read all transforms
in parallel instead of just parallelizing over different hierarchies.
Transforms aren't guaranteed to be valid when this scheduling mode is used.
Invalid transform references in the input array are still processed. Use
[TransformAccess.isValid](Jobs.TransformAccess-isValid.html) to check whether
a specific instance is valid.
