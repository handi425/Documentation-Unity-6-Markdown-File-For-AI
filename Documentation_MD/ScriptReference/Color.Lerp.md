## Declaration

public static [Color](Color.html) Lerp([Color](Color.html) a,
[Color](Color.html) b, float t);

### Parameters

a | Color a.  
---|---  
b | Color b.  
t | Float for combining a and b.  
  
### Description

Linearly interpolates between colors `a` and `b` by `t`.

`t` is clamped between 0 and 1. When `t` is 0 returns `a`. When `t` is 1
returns `b`.  
  
The code sample sets the color of a GameObject's material to a value between
white and black, based on the amount of time that has elapsed.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class ColorLerp : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        [Color](Color.html) lerpedColor = [Color.white](Color-white.html);
        [Renderer](Renderer.html) renderer;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            renderer = GetComponent<[Renderer](Renderer.html)>();
        }  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            lerpedColor = [Color.Lerp](Color.Lerp.html)([Color.white](Color-white.html), [Color.black](Color-black.html), [Mathf.PingPong](Mathf.PingPong.html)([Time.time](Time-time.html), 1));
            renderer.material.color = lerpedColor;
        }
    }
