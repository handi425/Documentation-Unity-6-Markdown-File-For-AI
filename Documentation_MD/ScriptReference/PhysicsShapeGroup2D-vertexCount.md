public int vertexCount;

### Description

The total number of vertices in the shape group used to represent all
[PhysicsShape2D](PhysicsShape2D.html) within it. (Read Only)

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.Assertions;

        void Start()
        {
            // Create a shape group.
            // NOTE: We can hint to the shape group the capacity for shapes so that it's quicker when adding them.
            var shapeGroup = new [PhysicsShapeGroup2D](PhysicsShapeGroup2D.html)(shapeCapacity: ShapeCount);  
      
            // Add Boxes to the shape group.
            for (var n = 0; n < ShapeCount; ++n)
            {

            // Validate that we created the correct number of vertices.
            // NOTE: Each [Box](UIElements.Box.html) has 4 vertices so we multiply this constant by the number of shapes.
            [Assert.AreEqual](Assertions.Assert.AreEqual.html)(ShapeCount * 4, shapeGroup.vertexCount);  
      
            // Validate each shape.

                var physicsShape = shapeGroup.GetShape(n);  
      
                // Validate the shape.
                [Assert.AreEqual](Assertions.Assert.AreEqual.html)([PhysicsShapeType2D.Polygon](PhysicsShapeType2D.Polygon.html), physicsShape.shapeType);
