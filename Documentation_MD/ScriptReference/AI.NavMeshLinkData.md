### Description

Used for runtime manipulation of links connecting polygons of the NavMesh.

A typical use case is to connect different navigation meshes. Use the
[NavMesh.AddLink](AI.NavMesh.AddLink.html) method to instantiate a link with
these properties in the navigation system. The [NavMesh
Link](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ai.navigation@2.0/manual/NavMeshLink.html)
component creates its runtime data in this way.

### Properties

[agentTypeID](AI.NavMeshLinkData-agentTypeID.html)| Specifies which agent type
this link is available for.  
---|---  
[area](AI.NavMeshLinkData-area.html)| Area type of the link.  
[bidirectional](AI.NavMeshLinkData-bidirectional.html)| If true, the link can
be traversed in both directions, otherwise only from start to end position.  
[costModifier](AI.NavMeshLinkData-costModifier.html)| If positive, overrides
the pathfinder cost to traverse the link.  
[endPosition](AI.NavMeshLinkData-endPosition.html)| End position of the link.  
[startPosition](AI.NavMeshLinkData-startPosition.html)| Start position of the
link.  
[width](AI.NavMeshLinkData-width.html)| If positive, the link will be
rectangle aligned along the line from start to end.
