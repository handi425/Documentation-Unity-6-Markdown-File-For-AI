## Declaration

public void SetGenericBinding([Object](Object.html) key, [Object](Object.html)
value);

### Parameters

key | The source object in the [PlayableBinding](Playables.PlayableBinding.html).  
---|---  
value | The object to bind to the key.  
  
### Description

Sets the binding of a reference object from a
[PlayableBinding](Playables.PlayableBinding.html).

Use this method to associate assets to objects loaded in the scene. For
example, use SetGenericBinding to bind a Timeline track to a GameObject or
Component.  
  
If the value is set to null, the source object is bound to null and the
dependency between the PlayableDirector and the source object is kept.
