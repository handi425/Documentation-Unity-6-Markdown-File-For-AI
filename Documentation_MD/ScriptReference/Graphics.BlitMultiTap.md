## Declaration

public static void BlitMultiTap([Texture](Texture.html) source,
[Rendering.GraphicsTexture](Rendering.GraphicsTexture.html) dest,
[Material](Material.html) mat, int destDepthSlice, params Vector2[] offsets);

### Parameters

source | Source texture.  
---|---  
dest | Destination [RenderTexture](RenderTexture.html), [GraphicsTexture](Rendering.GraphicsTexture.html), or `null` to blit directly to screen.  
mat | Material to use for copying. Material's shader should do some post-processing effect.  
offsets | Variable number of filtering offsets. Offsets are given in pixels.  
destDepthSlice | The texture array destination slice to blit to.  
  
### Description

Copies source texture into destination, for multi-tap shader.

This is mostly used for implementing some [post-processing
effects](../Manual/PostProcessingOverview.html). For example, Gaussian or
iterative Cone blurring samples source texture at multiple different
locations.  
  
BlitMultiTap sets `dest` to be the active render target (changing
[RenderTexture.active](RenderTexture-active.html) and
[GraphicsTexture.active](Rendering.GraphicsTexture-active.html)), sets
`source` as `_MainTex` property on the material, and draws a full-screen quad.
Each vertex of the quad has multiple texture coordinates set up, offset by
`offsets` pixels.  
  
BlitMultiTap has the same limitations as [Graphics.Blit](Graphics.Blit.html).

effects](../Manual/PostProcessingOverview.html).
