## Declaration

public void SetShaderPass(string passName);

### Parameters

passName | The Shader Pass to use when executing ray tracing shaders.  
---|---  
  
### Description

Selects which Shader Pass to use when executing ray/geometry intersection
shaders.

This name is specified in the ShaderLab shaders used by Materials applied to
Renderers used in ray tracing. If a shader doesn't have a Shader Pass with the
specified name, then no ray/geometry intersection code is executed. This
method must be called before calling RayTracingShader.DispatchRays.  
  
The Shader Pass code can include optional closest hit or any hit shaders.  
  
For procedural ray-traced geometries, an intersection shader must be authored.
The engine code will automatically enable a keywork named
`RAY_TRACING_PROCEDURAL_GEOMETRY` if the geometry is proceduraly ray-traced.  
  
The following example shader code returns the color red.

    
    
    SubShader
    {
        [Pass](ShaderData.Pass.html)
        {
            // [RayTracingShader.SetShaderPass](Rendering.RayTracingShader.SetShaderPass.html) must use this name in order to execute the ray tracing shaders from this [Pass](ShaderData.Pass.html).
            Name "Test"  
      
            // Add tags to identify the shaders to use for ray tracing.
            Tags{ "[LightMode](Experimental.GlobalIllumination.LightMode.html)" = "RayTracing" }  
      
            HLSLPROGRAM  
      
            #pragma multi_compile_local RAY_TRACING_PROCEDURAL_GEOMETRY  
      
            // Specify this shader is a raytracing shader.
            #pragma raytracing test  
      
            struct AttributeData
            {
                float2 barycentrics;
            };  
      
            struct RayPayload
            {
                float4 color;
            };  
      
    #if RAY_TRACING_PROCEDURAL_GEOMETRY
            [shader("intersection")]
            void IntersectionMain()
            {
                AttributeData attr;
                attr.barycentrics = float2(0, 0);
                ReportHit(0, 0, attr);
            }
    #endif  
      
            [shader("closesthit")]
            void ClosestHitMain(inout RayPayload payload : SV_RayPayload, AttributeData attribs : SV_IntersectionAttributes)
            {
                payload.color = float4(1, 0, 0, 1);
            }  
      
            ENDHLSL
        }
    }
