            [Event](Event.html) e = [Event.current](Event-current.html);
            if (e.button == 0 && e.isMouse)
            {
                [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("Left Click");
            }
            else if (e.button == 1)
            {
                [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("Right Click");
            }
            else if (e.button == 2)
            {
                [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("Middle Click");
            }
            else if (e.button > 2)
            {
                [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("Another button in the mouse clicked");
            }
