## Declaration

public static [AssetBundleCreateRequest](AssetBundleCreateRequest.html)
LoadFromMemoryAsync(byte[] binary);

## Declaration

public static [AssetBundleCreateRequest](AssetBundleCreateRequest.html)
LoadFromMemoryAsync(byte[] binary, uint crc);

### Parameters

binary | Array of bytes with the AssetBundle data.  
---|---  
crc | An optional CRC-32 checksum of the uncompressed content. If this is non-zero, then the content will be compared against the checksum before loading it, and give an error if it does not match.  
  
### Returns

**AssetBundleCreateRequest** Asynchronous load request for an AssetBundle. Use
[assetBundle](AssetBundleCreateRequest-assetBundle.html) property to get an
AssetBundle once it is loaded.

### Description

Asynchronously load an AssetBundle from a memory region.

Use this method to load an AssetBundle from an array of bytes asynchronously.
This is useful when you have downloaded the data with encryption using
UnityWebRequest and have the unencrypted bytes in memory instead of stored in
a file.  
  
Compared to [LoadFromMemory](AssetBundle.LoadFromMemory.html), this version
will perform AssetBundle decompression on a background thread, and will not
create the AssetBundle object immediately.  
  
The content of the provided byte array is copied to create a temporary
AssetBundle file in Memory, and that file is then loaded. Depending on the
compression of the original AssetBundle, and the setting for
[Caching.compressionEnabled](Caching-compressionEnabled.html), this may also
involve converting the content to LZ4 or uncompressed format. See
[AssetBundles compression](../Manual/AssetBundles-Cache.html) for more
details.  
  
The following example shows how to use this method. Note, for the sake of
keeping the example simple it reads the bytes from disk, which means it has no
advantage over calling AssetBundle.LoadFromFileAsync directly.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;
    using System.IO;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        IEnumerator LoadFromMemoryAsync(string path)
        {
            [AssetBundleCreateRequest](AssetBundleCreateRequest.html) createRequest = [AssetBundle.LoadFromMemoryAsync](AssetBundle.LoadFromMemoryAsync.html)([File.ReadAllBytes](Windows.File.ReadAllBytes.html)(path));
            yield return createRequest;
            [AssetBundle](AssetBundle.html) bundle = createRequest.assetBundle;
            var prefab = bundle.LoadAsset<[GameObject](GameObject.html)>("MyObject");
            Instantiate(prefab);  
      
            bundle.Unload(true);
        }
    }
