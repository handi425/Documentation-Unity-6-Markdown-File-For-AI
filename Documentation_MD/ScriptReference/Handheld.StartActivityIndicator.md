## Declaration

public static void StartActivityIndicator();

### Description

Starts os activity indicator.

Please be warned that this informs os ui system to start. For actual animation
to take effect you usually need to wait till the end of this frame. So if you
want activity indicator to be animated during synced operation, please use
coroutines. Note: You can't move the activity indicator invoked by this
method.
