in the Manual")

## Declaration

public [Vector3](Vector3.html) InverseTransformPoint([Vector3](Vector3.html)
position);

### Description

Transforms `position` from world space to local space.

This function is essentially the opposite of
[Transform.TransformPoint](Transform.TransformPoint.html) which is used to
convert from local to world space.  
  
Note that the returned position is affected by scale. Use
[Transform.InverseTransformDirection](Transform.InverseTransformDirection.html)
if you are dealing with direction vectors rather than positions.  
  
If you need to transform many points at once consider using
[Transform.InverseTransformPoints](Transform.InverseTransformPoints.html)
instead as it is much faster than repeatedly calling this function.

    
    
    // Calculate the transform's position relative to the camera.
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public [Transform](Transform.html) cam;
        public [Vector3](Vector3.html) cameraRelative;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            cam = Camera.main.transform;
            [Vector3](Vector3.html) cameraRelative = cam.InverseTransformPoint(transform.position);  
      
            if (cameraRelative.z > 0)
                print("The object is in front of the camera");
            else
                print("The object is behind the camera");
        }
    }

## Declaration

public [Vector3](Vector3.html) InverseTransformPoint(float x, float y, float

Transforms the position `x`, `y`, `z` from world space to local space.

This function is essentially the opposite of
[Transform.TransformPoint](Transform.TransformPoint.html) which is used to
convert from local to world space.  
  
Note that the returned position is affected by scale. Use

            if (relativePoint.z > 0)
                print("The world origin is in front of this object");
