## Declaration

public static [Vector3](Vector3.html) SmoothDamp([Vector3](Vector3.html)
current, [Vector3](Vector3.html) target, ref [Vector3](Vector3.html)
currentVelocity, float smoothTime, float maxSpeed = Mathf.Infinity, float
deltaTime = Time.deltaTime);

### Parameters

current | The current position.  
---|---  
target | The position we are trying to reach.  
currentVelocity | The current velocity, this value is modified by the function every time you call it.  
smoothTime | Approximately the time it will take to reach the target. A smaller value will reach the target faster.  
maxSpeed | Optionally allows you to clamp the maximum speed.  
deltaTime | The time since the last call to this function. By default Time.deltaTime.  
  
### Description

Gradually changes a vector towards a desired goal over time.

The vector is smoothed by some spring-damper like function, which will never
overshoot. The most common use is for smoothing a follow camera.

    
    
    // Smooth towards the target  
      
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public [Transform](Transform.html) target;
        public float smoothTime = 0.3F;
        private [Vector3](Vector3.html) velocity = [Vector3.zero](Vector3-zero.html);  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            // Define a target position above and behind the target transform
            [Vector3](Vector3.html) targetPosition = target.TransformPoint(new [Vector3](Vector3.html)(0, 5, -10));  
      
            // Smoothly move the camera towards that target position
            transform.position = [Vector3.SmoothDamp](Vector3.SmoothDamp.html)(transform.position, targetPosition, ref velocity, smoothTime);
        }
    }
