### Parameters

other | The other Collider involved in this collision.  
---|---  
  
### Description

OnTriggerExit is called when the [Collider](Collider.html) `other` has stopped
touching the trigger.

This message is sent to the trigger and the Collider that touches the trigger.  
  
**Notes:** Trigger events are only sent if one of the Colliders also has a
Rigidbody attached. Trigger events will be sent to disabled MonoBehaviours, to
allow enabling Behaviours in response to collisions.
[OnTriggerExit](Collider.OnTriggerExit.html) occurs on the FixedUpdate after
the Colliders have stopped touching. The Colliders involved are not guaranteed
to be at the point of initial separation. Deactivating or destroying a
Collider while it is inside a trigger volume will not register an on exit
event.  
  
Additional resources: [Collider.OnTriggerEnter](Collider.OnTriggerEnter.html)
which contains a useful example.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void OnTriggerExit([Collider](Collider.html) other)
        {
            // Destroy everything that leaves the trigger
            Destroy(other.gameObject);
        }
    }
