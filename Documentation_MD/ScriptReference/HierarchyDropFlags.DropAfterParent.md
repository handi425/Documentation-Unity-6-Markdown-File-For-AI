### Description

Drop a dragged object into the first child position after the parent of the
Hierarchy item when the mouse is hovering between the parent and the first
child. The dropTargetInstanceID is the first child under a parent and the
dropped object is inserted between the parent and the first child. When using
DropAfterParent, DropBetween and DropAbove are also used to provide
information to locate the dropped object.
