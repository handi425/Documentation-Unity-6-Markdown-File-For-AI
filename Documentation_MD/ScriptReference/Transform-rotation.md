[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-Transform.html "Go to Transform Component
in the Manual")

public [Quaternion](Quaternion.html) rotation;

### Description

A [Quaternion](Quaternion.html) that stores the rotation of the Transform in
world space.

[Transform.rotation](Transform-rotation.html) stores a
[Quaternion](Quaternion.html). You can use [rotation](Transform-rotation.html)
to rotate a GameObject or provide the current rotation. Do not attempt to
edit/modify [rotation](Transform-rotation.html).
[Transform.rotation](Transform-rotation.html) is less than 180 degrees.  
  
[Transform.rotation](Transform-rotation.html) has no gimbal lock.  
  
To rotate a [Transform](Transform.html), use
[Transform.Rotate](Transform.Rotate.html), which uses Euler Angles.  
  
If you want to match values you see in the Inspector, use the
[Quaternion.eulerAngles](Quaternion-eulerAngles.html) property on the returned
[Quaternion](Quaternion.html).

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    // [Transform.rotation](Transform-rotation.html) example.  
      
    // [Rotate](UIElements.Rotate.html) a [GameObject](GameObject.html) using a [Quaternion](Quaternion.html).
    // Tilt the cube using the arrow keys. When the arrow keys are released
    // the cube will be rotated back to the center using Slerp.  
      
    public class ExampleScript : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        float smooth = 5.0f;
        float tiltAngle = 60.0f;  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            // Smoothly tilts a transform towards a target rotation.
            float tiltAroundZ = [Input.GetAxis](Input.GetAxis.html)("Horizontal") * tiltAngle;
            float tiltAroundX = [Input.GetAxis](Input.GetAxis.html)("Vertical") * tiltAngle;  
      
            // [Rotate](UIElements.Rotate.html) the cube by converting the angles into a quaternion.
            [Quaternion](Quaternion.html) target = [Quaternion.Euler](Quaternion.Euler.html)(tiltAroundX, 0, tiltAroundZ);  
      
            // Dampen towards the target rotation
            transform.rotation = [Quaternion.Slerp](Quaternion.Slerp.html)(transform.rotation, target,  [Time.deltaTime](Time-deltaTime.html) * smooth);
        }
    }
    

In the above example, the [rotation](Transform-rotation.html) is described by
a quaternion. For more advice, see [Rotation and Orientation in
Unity](../Manual/QuaternionAndEulerRotationsInUnity.html).
