behavior. Unity will only recompile scripts that have changed, or that need
recompiling due to changes in settings that affect script compilation.

[CleanBuildCache](Compilation.RequestScriptCompilationOptions.CleanBuildCache.html)|
Clear all cached build results, resulting in a full rebuild of all scripts.
