**Obsolete** The experimental NavMeshQuery struct has been deprecated without
replacement.

## Declaration

public PathQueryStatus BeginFindPath(NavMeshLocation start, NavMeshLocation
end, int areaMask, NativeArray<float> costs);

### Parameters

costs | Array of custom cost values for all of the 32 possible area types. Each value must be at least `1.0f`. This parameter is optional and defaults to the area costs configured in the project settings. Additional resources: [NavMesh.GetAreaCost](AI.NavMesh.GetAreaCost.html).  
---|---  
areaMask | Bitmask with values of 1 set at the indices for areas that can be traversed, and values of 0 for areas that are not traversable. This parameter is optional and defaults to [NavMesh.AllAreas](AI.NavMesh.AllAreas.html), if omitted. Additional resources: [Areas and Costs](../Manual/nav-AreasAndCosts.html).  
start | The start location on the NavMesh for the path.  
end | The location on the NavMesh where the path ends.  
  
### Returns

**PathQueryStatus** `InProgress` if the operation was successful and the query
is ready to search for a path.  
`Failure` if the query's NavMeshWorld or any of the received parameters are no
longer valid.

### Description

Initiates a pathfinding operation between two locations on the NavMesh.

The path always begins at the specified location. If the desired end location
is not directly accessible, the search algorithm tries to find a valid
location nearby.  
Calling this method overrides the progress made by this NavMeshQuery in the
previous pathfinding operation.  
  
NavMeshQuery.UpdateFindPath should be called after this method to process the
path search.
