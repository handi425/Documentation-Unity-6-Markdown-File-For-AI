public void Focus();

### Description

Moves keyboard focus to another EditorWindow.

The [Focus](EditorWindow.Focus.html) public method controls which window is
active for use of the keyboard. In the examples below the active EditorWindow
keyboard is changed to a different EditorWindow keyboard. Additional
resources: [focusedWindow](EditorWindow-focusedWindow.html).
