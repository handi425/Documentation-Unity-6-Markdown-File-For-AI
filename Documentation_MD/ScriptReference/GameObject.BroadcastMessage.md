## Declaration

public void BroadcastMessage(string methodName, object parameter = null,
[SendMessageOptions](SendMessageOptions.html) options =
SendMessageOptions.RequireReceiver);

### Parameters

methodName | The name of the MonoBehaviour method to call.  
---|---  
parameter | An optional parameter value to pass to the called method.  
options | Whether an error should be raised if the method doesn't exist on the target object.  
  
### Description

Calls the specified method on every MonoBehaviour attached to the GameObject
or any of its children.

A `parameter` specified for a method that doesn't accept parameters is

an error is printed when the message is not picked up by any component.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            /// Calls the function ApplyDamage with a value of 5
            /// // Every script attached to the [GameObject](GameObject.html) and all its children
            // that has a ApplyDamage function will be called.
            gameObject.BroadcastMessage("ApplyDamage", 5.0);
        }
    }  
      
    
    public class Example2 : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
