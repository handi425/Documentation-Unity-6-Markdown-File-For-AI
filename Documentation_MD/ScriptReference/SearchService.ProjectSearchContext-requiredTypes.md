public IEnumerable<Type> requiredTypes;

### Description

An IEnumerable of types that contains the type constraints for this search.

This IEnumerable can be null or empty. If it is not empty, but contains null
values, you can find the required type for the search in the
SearchService.Project.SearchContext.requiredTypeNames IEnumerable instead.
Both IEnumerables contain the same number of elements, and map to each other
one-to-one.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
