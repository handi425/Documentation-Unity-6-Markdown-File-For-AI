### Description

Sets the [Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) to have static behaviour.

Static behaviour stops the [Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) from reacting to
gravity or applied forces including contacts with any other
[Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html).  
  
This type of [Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) should never repositioned
explicitly. It is designed to never move.  
  
A static [Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) will only collide with a dynamic
[Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) body type. The exception to this is if
[Rigidbody2D.useFullKinematicContacts](Rigidbody2D-useFullKinematicContacts.html)
is set to true in which case it will also collide with any
[[[Kinematic](RigidbodyType2D.Kinematic.html)]] body types.  
  
When an attached [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) is set to trigger, it will
always produce a trigger for any [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) attached to
[[[Dynamic](RigidbodyType2D.Dynamic.html)]] or
[[[Kinematic](RigidbodyType2D.Kinematic.html)]] body types.  
  
Additional resources: [Rigidbody2D.bodyType](Rigidbody2D-bodyType.html),
[Rigidbody2D.useFullKinematicContacts](Rigidbody2D-useFullKinematicContacts.html).
