## Declaration

public void SetColumn(int index, [Vector4](Vector4.html) column);

### Description

Sets a column of the matrix.

You use this to build transformation matrices using right, up and forward
vectors:

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class ExampleScript : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        // build a matrix from a transform.
        [Matrix4x4](Matrix4x4.html) matrix = new [Matrix4x4](Matrix4x4.html)();  
      
        /// Build a matrix from a transform.
        void Start()
        {
            matrix.SetColumn(0, transform.right);
            matrix.SetColumn(1, transform.up);
            matrix.SetColumn(2, transform.forward);
            var p = transform.position;
            matrix.SetColumn(3, new [Vector4](Vector4.html)(p.x, p.y, p.z, 1));
        }
    }
    

The i-th column is set from `v`. `i` must be from 0 to 3 inclusive.
