## Declaration

public static int RaycastNonAlloc([Ray](Ray.html) ray, RaycastHit[] results,
float maxDistance = Mathf.Infinity, int layerMask = DefaultRaycastLayers,
[QueryTriggerInteraction](QueryTriggerInteraction.html)
queryTriggerInteraction = QueryTriggerInteraction.UseGlobal);

### Parameters

ray | The starting point and direction of the ray.  
---|---  
results | The buffer to store the hits into.  
maxDistance | The max distance the rayhit is allowed to be from the start of the ray.  
layerMask | A [Layer mask](../Manual/Layers.html) that is used to selectively ignore colliders when casting a ray.  
queryTriggerInteraction | Specifies whether this query should hit Triggers.  
  
### Returns

**int** The amount of hits stored into the `results` buffer.

### Description

Cast a ray through the Scene and store the hits into the buffer.

Like [Physics.RaycastAll](Physics.RaycastAll.html), but generates no garbage.  
  
The raycast query ends when there are no more hits and/or the results buffer
is full. The order of the results is undefined. When a full buffer is returned
it is not guaranteed that the results are the closest hits and the length of
the buffer is returned. If a null buffer is passed in, no results are returned
and no errors or exceptions are thrown.

## Declaration

public static int RaycastNonAlloc([Vector3](Vector3.html) origin,
[Vector3](Vector3.html) direction, RaycastHit[] results, float maxDistance =
Mathf.Infinity, int layerMask = DefaultRaycastLayers,
[QueryTriggerInteraction](QueryTriggerInteraction.html)
queryTriggerInteraction = QueryTriggerInteraction.UseGlobal);

### Parameters

origin | The starting point and direction of the ray.  
---|---  
results | The buffer to store the hits into.  
direction | The direction of the ray.  
maxDistance | The max distance the rayhit is allowed to be from the start of the ray.  
queryTriggerInteraction | Specifies whether this query should hit Triggers.  
layerMask | A [Layer mask](../Manual/Layers.html) that is used to selectively ignore colliders when casting a ray.  
  
### Returns

**int** The amount of hits stored into the `results` buffer.

### Description

Cast a ray through the Scene and store the hits into the buffer.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        // The size of the array determines how many raycasts will occur
        [RaycastHit](RaycastHit.html)[] m_Results = new [RaycastHit](RaycastHit.html)[5];  
      
        // See [Order of Execution for Event Functions](../Manual/ExecutionOrder.html) for information on [FixedUpdate](PlayerLoop.FixedUpdate.html)() and [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)() related to physics queries
        void [FixedUpdate](PlayerLoop.FixedUpdate.html)()
        {
            // Set the layer mask to all layers
            var layerMask = ~0;  
      
            int hits = [Physics.RaycastNonAlloc](Physics.RaycastNonAlloc.html)(transform.position, transform.forward, m_Results, [Mathf.Infinity](Mathf.Infinity.html), layerMask);
            for (int i = 0; i < hits; i++)
            {
                [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("Hit " + m_Results[i].collider.gameObject.name);
            }
            if (hits == 0)
            {
                [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("Did not hit");
            }
        }
    }
