public static bool supportsIndirectDispatchRays;

### Description

Returns `true` if the graphics system supports indirect ray tracing dispatch.
(Read Only)

This feature enables scenarios where shaders generate ray tracing data (for
example ray buffers) and call arguments for the `DispatchRays` method directly
into a GPU buffer allowing a GPU-driven execution flow.  
  
In DirectX 12, this feature is part of DirectX Raytracing (DXR) Tier 1.1.
