## Declaration

public static string AssetPathToGUID(string path);

## Declaration

public static string AssetPathToGUID(string path,
[AssetPathToGUIDOptions](AssetPathToGUIDOptions.html) options =
AssetPathToGUIDOptions.IncludeRecentlyDeletedAssets);

### Parameters

path | Filesystem path for the asset.  
---|---  
options | Specifies whether this method should return a GUID for recently deleted assets. The default value is [AssetPathToGUIDOptions.IncludeRecentlyDeletedAssets](AssetPathToGUIDOptions.IncludeRecentlyDeletedAssets.html).  
  
### Returns

**string** GUID.

### Description

Get the GUID for the asset at `path`.

All paths are relative to the project folder, for example:
"Assets/MyTextures/hello.png".  
  
When you delete an asset, the GUID for that asset remains in Unity's asset
database until you close the Editor. As a result, by default this method will
still return GUIDs for assets that were deleted in the current session of the
Unity Editor.  
  
For assets that do not exist, and were not deleted in the current Editor
session, this method returns an empty string.  
  
If you need it to return an empty string for assets that were deleted in the
current Editor session, pass the value
[AssetPathToGUIDOptions.OnlyExistingAssets](AssetPathToGUIDOptions.OnlyExistingAssets.html)
as the "options" parameter.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        [[MenuItem](MenuItem.html)("[AssetDatabase](AssetDatabase.html)/AssetPathToGUID")]
        static void Doit()
        {
            // texture.jpg exists or was recently deleted
            string t = [AssetDatabase.AssetPathToGUID](AssetDatabase.AssetPathToGUID.html)("Assets/texture.jpg");
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)(t); // t will be not null
        }  
      
        [[MenuItem](MenuItem.html)("[AssetDatabase](AssetDatabase.html)/AssetPathToGUID Existing Assets Only")]
        static void DoitExistingAssetsOnly()
        {
            // texture.jpg does not exist on disk
            string t = [AssetDatabase.AssetPathToGUID](AssetDatabase.AssetPathToGUID.html)("Assets/texture.jpg", [AssetPathToGUIDOptions.OnlyExistingAssets](AssetPathToGUIDOptions.OnlyExistingAssets.html));
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)(t); // t will be null
        }
    }
    

See [AssetDatabase.GUIDFromAssetPath](AssetDatabase.GUIDFromAssetPath.html)
for a version that returns a UnityEditor.GUID instead of a string.
