public float* instanceSortingPositions;

### Description

If
[BatchDrawCommandFlags.HasSortingPosition](Rendering.BatchDrawCommandFlags.HasSortingPosition.html)
is set for one or more draw commands, the `instanceSortingPositions` array
contains explicit `float3` world space positions that Unity uses for depth
sorting.  
The culling callback must allocate the memory for the
`instanceSortingPositions` using the `UnsafeUtility.Malloc` method and the
`Allocator.TempJob` parameter. The memory is released by Unity when the
rendering is complete.  
If the length of the array is 0, set its value to null.

The culling callback must allocate the memory for this using
[UnsafeUtility.Malloc](Unity.Collections.LowLevel.Unsafe.UnsafeUtility.Malloc.html)
with the [Allocator.TempJob](Unity.Collections.Allocator.TempJob.html)
parameter. Unity releases this memory when it finishes rendering the draw
commands.  
  
If no draw commands contain depth-sorted instances, set this to `null`.
