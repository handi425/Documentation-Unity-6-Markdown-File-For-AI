public byte[] data;

### Description

(Read Only) The raw data to pass as the POST request body when sending the
form.

Usually, you just pass the WWWForm object directly to the WWW constructor, but
you will need this variable if you want to change the request headers sent to
the web server.  
  
Additional resources: [headers](WWWForm-headers.html) variable.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;
    using System.Collections.Generic;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        IEnumerator Start()
        {
            [WWWForm](WWWForm.html) form = new [WWWForm](WWWForm.html)();
            form.AddField( "name", "value" );
            Dictionary<string, string> headers = form.headers;
            byte[] rawData = form.data;
            string url = "www.myurl.com";  
      
            // Add a custom header to the request.
            // In this case a basic authentication to access a password protected resource.
            headers["Authorization"] = "Basic " + System.Convert.ToBase64String(
                System.Text.Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes("username:password"));  
      
            // Post a request to an URL with our custom headers
            using (WWW www = new WWW(url, rawData, headers))
            {
                yield return www;
                //.. process results from WWW request here...
            }
        }
    }
