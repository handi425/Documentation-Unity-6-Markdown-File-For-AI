# Welcome to the Unity Scripting Reference!

This section of the documentation contains details of the scripting API that
Unity provides. To use this information, you should be familiar with the basic
theory and practice of scripting in Unity which is explained in the [Scripting
section](../Manual/ScriptingSection.html) of our manual.

The scripting reference is organised according to the classes available to
scripts which are described along with their methods, properties and any other
information relevant to their use.

The pages are extensively furnished with example code ("examples");
notwithstanding anything in the [Terms of Service](https://unity3d.com/legal)
to the contrary, Unity grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-
sublicensable, royalty-free license to access, to use, to modify, and to
distribute the examples without crediting Unity.

API are grouped by namespaces they belong to, and can be selected from the
sidebar to the left. For most users, the **UnityEngine** section will be the
main port of call.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
**Known Issue**. Please check with the Issue Tracker at
