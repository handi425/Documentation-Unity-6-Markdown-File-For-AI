## Declaration

public [Vector3](Vector3.html) ViewportToScreenPoint([Vector3](Vector3.html)
position);

### Description

Transforms `position` from viewport space into screen space.

Viewport space is normalized and relative to the camera. The bottom-left of
the camera is (0,0); the top-right is (1,1). The z position is in world units
from the camera.  
  
Screen space is defined in pixels. The bottom-left of the screen is (0,0); the
right-top is ([pixelWidth](Camera-pixelWidth.html),[pixelHeight](Camera-
pixelHeight.html)). The z position is in world units from the camera.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        // Draw an image based on normalized view coordinates
        // rather than pixel positions.
        [Texture2D](Texture2D.html) bottomPanel;  
      
        void VPToScreenPtExample()
        {
            var origin = Camera.main.ViewportToScreenPoint(new [Vector3](Vector3.html)(0.25f, 0.1f, 0));
            var extent = Camera.main.ViewportToScreenPoint(new [Vector3](Vector3.html)(0.5f, 0.2f, 0));  
      
            [GUI.DrawTexture](GUI.DrawTexture.html)(new [Rect](Rect.html)(origin.x, origin.y, extent.x, extent.y), bottomPanel);
        }
    }
