[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-TextureImporter.html "Go to TextureImporter
Component in the Manual")

public bool isReadable;

### Description

Whether Unity stores an additional copy of the imported texture's pixel data
in CPU-addressable memory.

By default, this is `false`. Set this to `true` only if you want to use the
texture with methods that read, write, and manipulate the pixel data on the
CPU, such as [Texture2D.GetPixels](Texture2D.GetPixels.html) or
[ImageConversion.EncodeToPNG](ImageConversion.EncodeToPNG.html).  
  
For more information, see [Texture.isReadable](Texture-isReadable.html).  
  
This corresponds to the **Read/Write Enabled** setting in the [Texture Import
Settings](../Manual/class-TextureImporter.html).

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
**Known Issue**. Please check with the Issue Tracker at
