### Description

GPU graphics data buffer, for working with geometry or compute shader data.

[ComputeShader](ComputeShader.html) programs often need to read or write
arbitrary data from or to memory buffers, and some rendering algorithms need a
lower level access or control over geometry data than what is provided by the
[Mesh](Mesh.html) class. You can use `GraphicsBuffer` for these cases. You
create the buffers from C# scripts, and then fill them with data using either
C# scripts or compute shader programs.  
  
A graphics buffer is similar to an array in C#, in that it has a number of
elements ([count](GraphicsBuffer-count.html)) of the same size
([stride](GraphicsBuffer-stride.html)). You must supply the intended buffer
usage ([target](GraphicsBuffer-target.html)) when you create a GraphicsBuffer;
for example, you must pass
[GraphicsBuffer.Target.Index](GraphicsBuffer.Target.Index.html) for the buffer
to be usable as a geometry index buffer.  
  
When you have finished working with the buffer, you must manually release the
GPU memory. You can do this using C# dispose pattern, or by calling
[Release](GraphicsBuffer.Release.html).

### Properties

[bufferHandle](GraphicsBuffer-bufferHandle.html)| The internal handle of this
GraphicsBuffer. Only valid until the buffer is disposed of. (Read Only)  
---|---  
[count](GraphicsBuffer-count.html)| Number of elements in the buffer (Read
Only).  
[name](GraphicsBuffer-name.html)| The debug label for the graphics buffer
(setter only).  
[stride](GraphicsBuffer-stride.html)| Size of one element in the buffer. For
index buffers, this must be either 2 or 4 bytes (Read Only).  
[target](GraphicsBuffer-target.html)| Target, which specifies the intended
target(s) of this GraphicsBuffer (Read Only).  
[usageFlags](GraphicsBuffer-usageFlags.html)| The flags that specify how this
GraphicsBuffer can be used or updated (Read Only).  
  
### Constructors

[GraphicsBuffer](GraphicsBuffer-ctor.html)| Create a Graphics Buffer.  
---|---  
  
### Public Methods

[GetData](GraphicsBuffer.GetData.html)| Read data values from the buffer into
an array. The array can only use blittable types.  
---|---  
[GetNativeBufferPtr](GraphicsBuffer.GetNativeBufferPtr.html)| Retrieve a
native (underlying graphics API) pointer to the buffer.  
[IsValid](GraphicsBuffer.IsValid.html)| Returns true if this graphics buffer
is valid, or false otherwise.  
[LockBufferForWrite](GraphicsBuffer.LockBufferForWrite.html)| Begins a write
operation to the buffer  
[Release](GraphicsBuffer.Release.html)| Release a Graphics Buffer.  
[SetCounterValue](GraphicsBuffer.SetCounterValue.html)| Sets counter value of
append/consume buffer.  
[SetData](GraphicsBuffer.SetData.html)| Set the buffer with values from an
array.  
[UnlockBufferAfterWrite](GraphicsBuffer.UnlockBufferAfterWrite.html)| Ends a
write operation to the buffer  
  
### Static Methods

[CopyCount](GraphicsBuffer.CopyCount.html)| Copy the counter value of a
GraphicsBuffer into another buffer.
