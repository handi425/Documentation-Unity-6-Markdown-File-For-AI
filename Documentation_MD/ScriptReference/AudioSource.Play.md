[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-AudioSource.html "Go to AudioSource
Component in the Manual")

## Declaration

public void Play(ulong delay = 0);

### Parameters

delay | Deprecated. Delay in number of samples, assuming a 44100Hz sample rate (meaning that Play(44100) will delay the playing by exactly 1 sec).  
---|---  
  
### Description

Plays the [clip](AudioSource-clip.html).

The delay parameter is deprecated, please use the newer
[AudioSource.PlayDelayed](AudioSource.PlayDelayed.html) function instead which
specifies the delay in seconds.  
  
If [AudioSource.clip](AudioSource-clip.html) is set to the same clip that is
playing then the clip will sound like it is re-started.
[AudioSource](AudioSource.html) will assume any [Play](AudioSource.Play.html)
call will have a new audio clip to play.  
  
**Note:** The [AudioSource.PlayScheduled](AudioSource.PlayScheduled.html) API
will give you more accurate control over when the audio clip is played.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    // The Audio Source component has an [AudioClip](AudioClip.html) option.  The audio
    // played in this example comes from [AudioClip](AudioClip.html) and is called audioData.  
      
    [[RequireComponent](RequireComponent.html)(typeof([AudioSource](AudioSource.html)))]
    public class ExampleScript : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        [AudioSource](AudioSource.html) audioData;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            audioData = GetComponent<[AudioSource](AudioSource.html)>();
            audioData.Play(0);
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("started");
        }  
      
        void OnGUI()
        {
            if ([GUI.Button](GUI.Button.html)(new [Rect](Rect.html)(10, 70, 150, 30), "Pause"))
            {
                audioData.Pause();
                [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("Pause: " + audioData.time);
            }  
      
            if ([GUI.Button](GUI.Button.html)(new [Rect](Rect.html)(10, 170, 150, 30), "Continue"))
            {
                audioData.UnPause();
            }
        }
    }
