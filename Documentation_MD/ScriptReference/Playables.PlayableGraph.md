### Description

Use the PlayableGraph to manage [Playable](Playables.Playable.html) creations
and destructions.

The PlayableGraph is also the link to different systems, through structs that
implement [IPlayableOutput](Playables.IPlayableOutput.html). For example,
[AnimationPlayableOutput](Animations.AnimationPlayableOutput.html) or
[AudioPlayableOutput](Audio.AudioPlayableOutput.html).

### Public Methods

[Connect](Playables.PlayableGraph.Connect.html)| Connects two Playable
instances.  
---|---  
[Destroy](Playables.PlayableGraph.Destroy.html)| Destroys the graph.  
[DestroyOutput](Playables.PlayableGraph.DestroyOutput.html)| Destroys the
PlayableOutput.  
[DestroyPlayable](Playables.PlayableGraph.DestroyPlayable.html)| Destroys the
Playable.  
[DestroySubgraph](Playables.PlayableGraph.DestroySubgraph.html)| Destroys the
Playable and all its inputs, recursively.  
[Disconnect](Playables.PlayableGraph.Disconnect.html)| Disconnects the
Playable. The connections determine the topology of the PlayableGraph and how
it is evaluated.  
[Evaluate](Playables.PlayableGraph.Evaluate.html)| Evaluates all the
PlayableOutputs in the graph, and updates all the connected Playables in the
graph.  
[GetEditorName](Playables.PlayableGraph.GetEditorName.html)| Returns the name
of the PlayableGraph.  
[GetOutput](Playables.PlayableGraph.GetOutput.html)| Get PlayableOutput at the
given index in the graph.  
[GetOutputByType](Playables.PlayableGraph.GetOutputByType.html)| Get
PlayableOutput of the requested type at the given index in the graph.  
[GetOutputCount](Playables.PlayableGraph.GetOutputCount.html)| Returns the
number of PlayableOutput in the graph.  
[GetOutputCountByType](Playables.PlayableGraph.GetOutputCountByType.html)| Get
the number of PlayableOutput of the requested type in the graph.  
[GetPlayableCount](Playables.PlayableGraph.GetPlayableCount.html)| Returns the
number of Playable owned by the Graph.  
[GetResolver](Playables.PlayableGraph.GetResolver.html)| Returns the table
used by the graph to resolve ExposedReferences.  
[GetRootPlayable](Playables.PlayableGraph.GetRootPlayable.html)| Returns the
Playable with no output connections at the given index.  
[GetRootPlayableCount](Playables.PlayableGraph.GetRootPlayableCount.html)|
Returns the number of Playable owned by the Graph that have no connected
outputs.  
[GetTimeUpdateMode](Playables.PlayableGraph.GetTimeUpdateMode.html)| Returns
how time is incremented when playing back.  
[IsDone](Playables.PlayableGraph.IsDone.html)| Indicates that a graph has
completed its operations.  
[IsPlaying](Playables.PlayableGraph.IsPlaying.html)| Indicates that a graph is
presently running.  
[IsValid](Playables.PlayableGraph.IsValid.html)| Returns true if the
PlayableGraph has been properly constructed using PlayableGraph.CreateGraph
and is not deleted.  
[Play](Playables.PlayableGraph.Play.html)| Plays the graph.  
[SetResolver](Playables.PlayableGraph.SetResolver.html)| Changes the table
used by the graph to resolve ExposedReferences.  
[SetTimeUpdateMode](Playables.PlayableGraph.SetTimeUpdateMode.html)| Changes
how time is incremented when playing back.  
[Stop](Playables.PlayableGraph.Stop.html)| Stops the graph, if it is playing.
