## Declaration

public static RaycastHit[] SphereCastAll([Vector3](Vector3.html) origin, float
radius, [Vector3](Vector3.html) direction, float maxDistance = Mathf.Infinity,
int layerMask = DefaultRaycastLayers,
[QueryTriggerInteraction](QueryTriggerInteraction.html)
queryTriggerInteraction = QueryTriggerInteraction.UseGlobal);

### Parameters

origin | The center of the sphere at the start of the sweep.  
---|---  
radius | The radius of the sphere.  
direction | The direction in which to sweep the sphere.  
maxDistance | The max length of the sweep.  
layerMask | A [Layer mask](../Manual/Layers.html) that is used to selectively ignore colliders when casting a sphere.  
queryTriggerInteraction | Specifies whether this query should hit Triggers.  
  
### Returns

**RaycastHit[]** An array of all colliders hit in the sweep.

### Description

Like [Physics.SphereCast](Physics.SphereCast.html), but this function will
return all hits the sphere sweep intersects.

Casts a sphere against all colliders in the Scene and returns detailed
information on each collider which was hit. This is useful when a Raycast does
not give enough precision, because you want to find out if an object of a
specific size, such as a character, will be able to move somewhere without
colliding with anything on the way.  
  
**Notes:** For colliders that overlap the sphere at the start of the sweep,
[RaycastHit.normal](RaycastHit-normal.html) is set opposite to the direction
of the sweep, [RaycastHit.distance](RaycastHit-distance.html) is set to zero,
and the zero vector gets returned in [RaycastHit.point](RaycastHit-
point.html). You might want to check whether this is the case in your
particular query and perform additional queries to refine the result. Passing
a zero radius results in undefined output and doesn't always behave the same
as [Physics.Raycast](Physics.Raycast.html).

## Declaration

public static RaycastHit[] SphereCastAll([Ray](Ray.html) ray, float radius,
float maxDistance = Mathf.Infinity, int layerMask = DefaultRaycastLayers,
[QueryTriggerInteraction](QueryTriggerInteraction.html)
queryTriggerInteraction = QueryTriggerInteraction.UseGlobal);

### Parameters

ray | The starting point and direction of the ray into which the sphere sweep is cast.  
---|---  
radius | The radius of the sphere.  
maxDistance | The max length of the sweep.  
layerMask | A [Layer mask](../Manual/Layers.html) that is used to selectively ignore colliders when casting a sphere.  
queryTriggerInteraction | Specifies whether this query should hit Triggers.  
  
### Description

Like [Physics.SphereCast](Physics.SphereCast.html), but this function will
return all hits the sphere sweep intersects.
