### Description

Representation of 3D vectors and points using integers.

This structure is used in some places to represent 3D positions and vectors
that don't require the precision of floating-point.

### Static Properties

[back](Vector3Int-back.html)| Shorthand for writing Vector3Int(0, 0, -1).  
---|---  
[down](Vector3Int-down.html)| Shorthand for writing Vector3Int(0, -1, 0).  
[forward](Vector3Int-forward.html)| Shorthand for writing Vector3Int(0, 0, 1).  
[left](Vector3Int-left.html)| Shorthand for writing Vector3Int(-1, 0, 0).  
[one](Vector3Int-one.html)| Shorthand for writing Vector3Int(1, 1, 1).  
[right](Vector3Int-right.html)| Shorthand for writing Vector3Int(1, 0, 0).  
[up](Vector3Int-up.html)| Shorthand for writing Vector3Int(0, 1, 0).  
[zero](Vector3Int-zero.html)| Shorthand for writing Vector3Int(0, 0, 0).  
  
### Properties

this vector (Read Only).  
[this[int]](Vector3Int.Index_operator.html)| Access the x, y or z component
using [0], [1] or [2] respectively.  
[x](Vector3Int-x.html)| X component of the vector.  
[y](Vector3Int-y.html)| Y component of the vector.  
[z](Vector3Int-z.html)| Z component of the vector.  
  
### Constructors

[Vector3Int](Vector3Int-ctor.html)| Initializes and returns an instance of a
new Vector3Int with x, y, z components.  
---|---  
  
### Public Methods

Vector3Int.  
[Set](Vector3Int.Set.html)| Set x, y and z components of an existing
Vector3Int.  
[ToString](Vector3Int.ToString.html)| Returns a formatted string for this
vector.  
  
### Static Methods

[CeilToInt](Vector3Int.CeilToInt.html)| Converts a Vector3 to a Vector3Int by
doing a Ceiling to each value.  
---|---  
[Distance](Vector3Int.Distance.html)| Returns the distance between a and b.

another.  
---|---
