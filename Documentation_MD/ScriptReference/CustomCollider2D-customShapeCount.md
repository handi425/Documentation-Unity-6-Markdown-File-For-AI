public int customShapeCount;

### Description

The total number of custom [PhysicsShape2D](PhysicsShape2D.html) assigned to
the Collider. (Read Only)

All the shapes represented here contain a total vertex count of
[customVertexCount](CustomCollider2D-customVertexCount.html).  
  
**NOTE** : This property should not be confused with
[Collider2D.shapeCount](Collider2D-shapeCount.html) which is a count of active
shapes on the [Collider2D](Collider2D.html). The
[CustomCollider2D](CustomCollider2D.html) has this property too. If a
[Collider2D](Collider2D.html) is disabled, inactive or in
[error](Collider2D-errorState.html) then the
[Collider2D.shapeCount](Collider2D-shapeCount.html) will be zero whereas the
[customShapeCount](CustomCollider2D-customShapeCount.html) will always be a
count of assigned custom [PhysicsShape2D](PhysicsShape2D.html).

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.Assertions;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            // Fetch the custom collider.
            var customCollider = GetComponent<[CustomCollider2D](CustomCollider2D.html)>();  
      
            // Create a shape group.
            var shapeGroup = new [PhysicsShapeGroup2D](PhysicsShapeGroup2D.html)();  
      
            // Add a Circle to the shape group.
            shapeGroup.AddCircle
                (
                    center: new [Vector2](Vector2.html)(-1f, 0f),
                    radius: 0.5f
                );  
      
            // Add a box to the shape group.
            shapeGroup.AddBox
                (
                    center: new [Vector2](Vector2.html)(1f, 0f),
                    size: new [Vector2](Vector2.html)(1f, 1f)
                );  
      
            // Assign our shapes.
            customCollider.SetCustomShapes(shapeGroup);  
      
            // Validate the custom shape count.
            [Assert.AreApproximatelyEqual](Assertions.Assert.AreApproximatelyEqual.html)(shapeGroup.shapeCount, customCollider.customShapeCount);
        }
    }
