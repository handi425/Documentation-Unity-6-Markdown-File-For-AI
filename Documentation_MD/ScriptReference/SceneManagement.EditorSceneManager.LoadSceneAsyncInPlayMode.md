## Declaration

public static [AsyncOperation](AsyncOperation.html)
LoadSceneAsyncInPlayMode(string path,
[SceneManagement.LoadSceneParameters](SceneManagement.LoadSceneParameters.html)
parameters);

### Parameters

path | Path to Scene to load.  
---|---  
parameters | Parameters to apply to loading. See [LoadSceneParameters](SceneManagement.LoadSceneParameters.html).  
  
### Returns

**AsyncOperation** Use the [AsyncOperation](AsyncOperation.html) to determine
if the operation has completed.

### Description

This method allows you to load a Scene during playmode in the editor, without
requiring the Scene to be included in the [Build
Settings](../Manual/BuildSettings.html) Scene list.

The use case for this is to emulate Asset bundles while loading scenes in play
mode in the editor. When including a Scene in an asset bundle, you don't add
the Scene to build settings. This means you can't load the Scene during play
mode using the normal
[LoadSceneAsync](SceneManagement.SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync.html) method.
Using this method instead of
[LoadSceneAsync](SceneManagement.SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync.html) allows you
to load the Scene during play mode without requiring it to be in the Build
Settings Scene list. This means your code needs to detect whether the game is
[running in the editor](Application-isEditor.html) or not, and use this method
(LoadSceneAsyncInPlayMode) when in the editor, and
[LoadSceneAsync](SceneManagement.SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync.html) when in the
built version.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
