public int layerMask;

### Description

A 32-bit mask that controls which layers a [GameObject](GameObject.html) must
be on to add it to the RayTracingAccelerationStructure.

Unity interprets the mask as binary. So a mask value of -1 allows you to add
renderers from all layers to the structure, a value of 1 only allows objects
on layer 0, and a value of 2 only allows objects on layer 1, for example.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
