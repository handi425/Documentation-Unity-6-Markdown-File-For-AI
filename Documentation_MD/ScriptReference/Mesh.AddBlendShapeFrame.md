## Declaration

public void AddBlendShapeFrame(string shapeName, float frameWeight, Vector3[]
deltaVertices, Vector3[] deltaNormals, Vector3[] deltaTangents);

### Parameters

shapeName | Name of the blend shape to add a frame to.  
---|---  
frameWeight | Weight for the frame being added.  
deltaVertices | Delta vertices for the frame being added.  
deltaNormals | Delta normals for the frame being added.  
deltaTangents | Delta tangents for the frame being added.  
  
### Description

Adds a new blend shape frame.

If blend shape name does not exist, then a new blend shape is created. Blend
shape frames can only be added to a new blend shape, or the last blend shape.
Usually there will be a single frame for a blend shape, but the range of
blending [0-100%] may be split into multiple frames. Weight is assumed to be
100% when a shape only has one frame. Frame must be added in an increasing
weight order for blend shapes having multiple frames. `deltaVertices`,
`deltaNormals` and `deltaTangents` arrays must be of size =
[Mesh.vertexCount](Mesh-vertexCount.html). Subtract Mesh vertices, normals or
tangents to convert from frame full vectors to get deltas. `deltaNormals` or
`deltaTangents` may be set to null if there are no normals or tangents for a
frame.
