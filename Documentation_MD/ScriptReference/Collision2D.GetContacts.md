## Declaration

public int GetContacts(ContactPoint2D[] contacts);

### Parameters

contacts | An array of [ContactPoint2D](ContactPoint2D.html) used to receive the results.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**int** Returns the number of contacts placed in the `contacts` array.

### Description

Retrieves all contact points for contacts between
[collider](Collision2D-collider.html) and
[otherCollider](Collision2D-otherCollider.html).

When retrieving contacts, you should ensure that the provided array is large
enough to contain all the contacts you are interested in. The array is usually
reused, so it should be large enough to return a reasonable quantity of
contacts. This function also means that no allocations occur, which means no
work is produced for the garbage collector.  
  
You can check how many contacts are available using
[contactCount](Collision2D-contactCount.html).

## Declaration

public int GetContacts(List<ContactPoint2D> contacts);

### Parameters

contacts | A list of [ContactPoint2D](ContactPoint2D.html) used to receive the results.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**int** Returns the number of contacts placed in the `contacts` list.

### Description

Retrieves all contact points for contacts between
[collider](Collision2D-collider.html) and
[otherCollider](Collision2D-otherCollider.html).

When retrieving contacts, try to make the provided list large enough to
contain all the contacts you need. If the list is not large enough, Unity will
automatically increase its size so that it can contain all the contacts. The
list is usually reused, so it should be large enough to return a reasonable
quantity of contacts. If the list does not have to be increased in size then
this function will not allocate any memory, which means no work is produced
for the garbage collector.  
  
You can check how many contacts are available using
[contactCount](Collision2D-contactCount.html).
