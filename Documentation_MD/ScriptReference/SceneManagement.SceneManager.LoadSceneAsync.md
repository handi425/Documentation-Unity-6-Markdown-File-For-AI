## Declaration

public static [AsyncOperation](AsyncOperation.html) LoadSceneAsync(int
sceneBuildIndex,
[SceneManagement.LoadSceneParameters](SceneManagement.LoadSceneParameters.html)
parameters);

### Parameters

sceneName | Name or path of the Scene to load.  
---|---  
sceneBuildIndex | Index of the Scene in the Build Settings to load.  
mode | If LoadSceneMode.Single then all current Scenes will be unloaded before loading.  
parameters | Struct that collects the various parameters into a single place except for the name and index.  
  
### Returns

**AsyncOperation** Use the [AsyncOperation](AsyncOperation.html) to determine
if the operation has completed.

### Description

Loads the Scene asynchronously in the background.

You can provide the full Scene path, the path shown in the Build Settings
window, or just the Scene name. If you only provide the Scene name, Unity
loads the first Scene in the list that matches. If you have multiple Scenes
with the same name but different paths, you should use the full Scene path in
the Build Settings.  
  
Examples of supported formats:  
`"Scene1"`  
`"Scenes/Scene1"`  
`"Scenes/Others/Scene1"`  
`"Assets/scenes/others/scene1.unity"`  
  
**Note:** Scene name input is not case-sensitive.  
If you call this method with an invalid **sceneName** or **sceneBuildIndex** ,
Unity throws an exception.  
  
**Note:** The name of the Scene to load can be case insensitive.  
  
If a single mode scene is loaded, Unity calls Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets
automatically.

    
    
    using System.Collections;
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            // Press the space key to start coroutine
            if ([Input.GetKeyDown](Input.GetKeyDown.html)([KeyCode.Space](KeyCode.Space.html)))
            {
                // Use a coroutine to load the [Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html) in the background
                StartCoroutine(LoadYourAsyncScene());
            }
        }  
      
        IEnumerator LoadYourAsyncScene()
        {
            // The [Application](Application.html) loads the [Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html) in the background as the current [Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html) runs.
            // This is particularly good for creating loading screens.
            // You could also load the [Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html) by using sceneBuildIndex. In this case Scene2 has
            // a sceneBuildIndex of 1 as shown in Build [Settings](Rendering.RayTracingAccelerationStructure.Settings.html).  
      
            [AsyncOperation](AsyncOperation.html) asyncLoad = [SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync](SceneManagement.SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync.html)("Scene2");  
      
            // Wait until the asynchronous scene fully loads
            while (!asyncLoad.isDone)
            {
                yield return null;
            }
        }
    }
