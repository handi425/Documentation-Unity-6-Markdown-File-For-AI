## Declaration

public bool Raycast([Ray](Ray.html) ray, out float enter);

### Description

Intersects a ray with the plane.

This function sets `enter` to the distance along the ray, where it intersects
the plane. If the ray is parallel to the plane, function returns `false` and
sets `enter` to zero. If the ray is pointing in the opposite direction than
the plane, function returns `false` and sets `enter` to the distance along the
ray (negative value).

    
    
    //This script detects mouse clicks on a plane using [Plane.Raycast](Plane.Raycast.html).
    //In this example, the plane is set to the [Camera](Camera.html)'s x and y position, but you can set the z position so the plane is in front of your [Camera](Camera.html).
    //The normal of the plane is set to facing forward so it is facing the [Camera](Camera.html), but you can change this to suit your own needs.  
      
    //In your [GameObject](GameObject.html)'s Inspector, set your clickable distance and attach a cube [GameObject](GameObject.html) in the appropriate fields
