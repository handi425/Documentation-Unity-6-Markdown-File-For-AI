public float bounciness;

### Description

The effective bounciness used for the [ContactPoint2D](ContactPoint2D.html).

When two [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) come into contact, both their
[Collider2D.bounciness](Collider2D-bounciness.html) values are combined.  
  
This property provides the result of that combination and is used by the
physics solver when calculating a collision response.
