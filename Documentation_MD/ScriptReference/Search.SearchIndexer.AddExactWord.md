            si.Start();
            var di = si.AddDocument("document1");
    
            // AddExactWord is used to add exact word match on queries using !"exact_match"
            si.AddExactWord("unity2020", score: 0, di);
    
            si.Finish(new string[0]);
            [Debug.Assert](Debug.Assert.html)(si.Search("unity").Count() == 0, "You need to search using !\"unity2020\"");
