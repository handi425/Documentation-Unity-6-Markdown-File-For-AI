LightingSettings Component in the Manual")

**Obsolete** Bake with the Progressive Lightmapper. The backend that uses
Enlighten to bake is obsolete. public bool finalGather;

### Description

Specifies whether the final light bounce of the global illumination
calculation is calculated at the same resolution as the baked lightmap.
(Editor only).

Final gather fires additional rays from the position of final lightmap texels
before compositing with Enlighten Realtime Global Illumination’s lower
resolution indirect lightmap. This can improve the appearance of effects such
as indirect shadowing and mitigate potential light leaks. However, this also
increases the amount of time needed to bake lighting.  
  
Setting for LightingSettings.Lightmapper.Enlighten.
