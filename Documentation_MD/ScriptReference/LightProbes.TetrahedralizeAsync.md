## Declaration

public static void TetrahedralizeAsync();

### Description

Asynchronously tetrahedralize all currently loaded LightProbe positions.

Call this function to asynchronously calculate a Delaunay tetrahedralization
of all currently loaded LightProbe positions, and update the
[LightProbes](LightProbes.html) object with the result. Note that Unity does
not raise an event when this asynchronous method completes.  
  
Call this method after you load a Scene with
[LoadSceneMode.Additive](SceneManagement.LoadSceneMode.Additive.html), or
unload a Scene with
[SceneManager.UnloadSceneAsync](SceneManagement.SceneManager.UnloadSceneAsync.html).
Note that updating the tetrahedral tessellation is CPU-intensive. For more
information, see [Light Probes and Scene loading](../Manual/light-probes-and-
scene-loading.html).

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;  
      
    public class TetrahedralizeAsyncExample : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            // Additively load a [Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html) containing light probes
            [SceneManager.LoadScene](SceneManagement.SceneManager.LoadScene.html)("ExampleScene", [LoadSceneMode.Additive](SceneManagement.LoadSceneMode.Additive.html));  
      
            // Force Unity to asynchronously regenerate the tetrahedral tesselation for all loaded Scenes
            [LightProbes.TetrahedralizeAsync](LightProbes.TetrahedralizeAsync.html)();
        }
    }
