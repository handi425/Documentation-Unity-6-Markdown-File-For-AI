## Declaration

public bool SetDestination([Vector3](Vector3.html) target);

### Parameters

target | The target point to navigate to.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**bool** True if the destination was requested successfully, otherwise false.

### Description

Sets or updates the destination thus triggering the calculation for a new
path.

Note that the path may not become available until after a few frames later.
While the path is being computed, [pathPending](AI.NavMeshAgent-
pathPending.html) will be true. If a valid path becomes available then the
agent will resume movement.

            myNavMeshAgent = GetComponent<[NavMeshAgent](AI.NavMeshAgent.html)>();
        }

            }

        {
            [RaycastHit](RaycastHit.html) hit;
            [Ray](Ray.html) ray = Camera.main.ScreenPointToRay([Input.mousePosition](Input-mousePosition.html));
            if ([Physics.Raycast](Physics.Raycast.html)(ray, out hit))
            {
                myNavMeshAgent.SetDestination(hit.point);
            }
        }
    }
