### Description

Delegate that you can use to invoke custom code before Unity renders an
individual Camera.

When Unity calls
[RenderPipeline.BeginCameraRendering](Rendering.RenderPipeline.BeginCameraRendering.html),
it executes the methods in this delegate's invocation list.  
  
In the Universal Render Pipeline (URP) and the High Definition Render Pipeline
(HDRP), Unity calls
[RenderPipeline.BeginCameraRendering](Rendering.RenderPipeline.BeginCameraRendering.html)
automatically. If you are writing a custom Scriptable Render Pipeline and you
want to use this delegate, you must add a call to
[RenderPipeline.BeginCameraRendering](Rendering.RenderPipeline.BeginCameraRendering.html).  
  
The following code example demonstrates how to add a method to this delegate's
invocation list, and later remove it.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.Rendering;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            [RenderPipelineManager.beginCameraRendering](Rendering.RenderPipelineManager-beginCameraRendering.html) += OnBeginCameraRendering;
        }  
      
        void OnBeginCameraRendering([ScriptableRenderContext](Rendering.ScriptableRenderContext.html) context, [Camera](Camera.html) camera)
        {
            // Put the code that you want to execute before the camera renders here
            // If you are using URP or HDRP, Unity calls this method automatically
            // If you are writing a custom SRP, you must call [RenderPipeline.BeginCameraRendering](Rendering.RenderPipeline.BeginCameraRendering.html)
        }  
      
        void OnDestroy()
        {
            [RenderPipelineManager.beginCameraRendering](Rendering.RenderPipelineManager-beginCameraRendering.html) -= OnBeginCameraRendering;
        }
    }
