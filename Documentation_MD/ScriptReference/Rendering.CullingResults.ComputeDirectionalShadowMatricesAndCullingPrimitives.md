## Declaration

public bool ComputeDirectionalShadowMatricesAndCullingPrimitives(int
activeLightIndex, int splitIndex, int splitCount, [Vector3](Vector3.html)
splitRatio, int shadowResolution, float shadowNearPlaneOffset, out
[Matrix4x4](Matrix4x4.html) viewMatrix, out [Matrix4x4](Matrix4x4.html)
projMatrix, out [Rendering.ShadowSplitData](Rendering.ShadowSplitData.html)
shadowSplitData);

### Parameters

activeLightIndex | The index into the active light array.  
---|---  
splitIndex | The cascade index.  
splitCount | The number of cascades.  
splitRatio | The cascade ratios.  
shadowResolution | The resolution of the shadowmap.  
shadowNearPlaneOffset | The near plane offset for the light.  
viewMatrix | The computed view matrix.  
projMatrix | The computed projection matrix.  
shadowSplitData | The computed cascade data.  
  
### Returns

**bool** If false, the shadow map for this cascade does not need to be
rendered this frame.

### Description

Calculates the view and projection matrices and shadow split data for a
directional light.
