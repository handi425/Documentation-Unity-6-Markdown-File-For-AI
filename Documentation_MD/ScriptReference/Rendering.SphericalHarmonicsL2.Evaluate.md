## Declaration

public void Evaluate(Vector3[] directions, Color[] results);

### Parameters

directions | Array of normalized directions in which to evaluate the spherical harmonics.  
---|---  
results | Output array for the evaluated values. The order of the results is the same as the directions array.  
  
### Description

Evaluates the spherical harmonics for each given direction. The `directions`
and `results` arrays must have the same size.

    
    
    using System.Collections;
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            UnityEngine.Rendering.SphericalHarmonicsL2 sh2;
            [LightProbes.GetInterpolatedProbe](LightProbes.GetInterpolatedProbe.html)(new [Vector3](Vector3.html)(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f), null, out sh2);  
      
            [Vector3](Vector3.html)[] directions = new [Vector3](Vector3.html)[]
            {
                new [Vector3](Vector3.html)(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f),
                new [Vector3](Vector3.html)(0.0f, -1.0f, 0.0f)
            };
            [Color](Color.html)[] results = new [Color](Color.html)[2];  
      
            sh2.Evaluate(directions, results);
        }
    }
