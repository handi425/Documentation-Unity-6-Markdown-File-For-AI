public ContactPoint2D[] contacts;

### Description

The specific points of contact with the incoming Collider2D. You should avoid
using this as it produces memory garbage. Use
[GetContact](Collision2D.GetContact.html) or
[GetContacts](Collision2D.GetContacts.html) instead.

Additional resources: [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) class.
