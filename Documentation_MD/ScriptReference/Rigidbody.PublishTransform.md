[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-Rigidbody.html "Go to Rigidbody Component
in the Manual")

## Declaration

public void PublishTransform();

### Description

Applies the [position](Rigidbody-position.html) and [rotation](Rigidbody-
rotation.html) of the Rigidbody to the corresponding
[Transform](Transform.html) component.

This is more efficient than setting [Transform.position](Transform-
position.html) and [Transform.rotation](Transform-rotation.html) manually.  
  
Note: This method doesn't update the child Transforms. It should be called
from the topmost Transform, down the hierarchy.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class PositionTracker : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        private [PhysicsScene](PhysicsScene.html) m_SomeScene;
        private [Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html) m_Rigidbody;  
      
        public void SimulateTrajectory(float totalTime)
        {
            m_SomeScene.RunSimulationStages(0f, [SimulationStage.PrepareSimulation](SimulationStage.PrepareSimulation.html));  
      
            for (int i = 0; i < totalTime / [Time.fixedDeltaTime](Time-fixedDeltaTime.html); i++)
                m_SomeScene.RunSimulationStages([Time.fixedDeltaTime](Time-fixedDeltaTime.html), [SimulationStage.RunSimulation](SimulationStage.RunSimulation.html));  
      
            // [Transform](Transform.html) of the m_Rigidbody is still like it was at the start of the method
            m_Rigidbody.PublishTransform();
            // [Transform](Transform.html) of the m_Rigidbody is now up to date and can be accessed to see where the body ended up after simulating for "totalTime" seconds
        }
    }
    

Simulate a [PhysicsScene](PhysicsScene.html) with a
[Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html) and use
[PublishTransform](Rigidbody.PublishTransform.html) to read the information
from the physics system to the [Transform](Transform.html) component.
