## Declaration

public int GetPath(int index, Vector2[] points);

### Parameters

index | The index of the path from 0 to [pathCount](CompositeCollider2D-pathCount.html) minus 1.  
---|---  
points | An ordered array of the vertices (points) in the selected path.  
  
### Returns

**int** Returns the number of points placed in the `points` array.

### Description

Gets a path from the Collider by its index.

A _path_ is a cyclic sequence of line segments between points that define the
outline of the Collider. Since the Collider can have holes and discontinuous
parts, its shape is not necessarily defined by a single path.  
  
Returns the number of points placed in the `points` array.

## Declaration

public int GetPath(int index, List<Vector2> points);

### Parameters

index | The index of the path from 0 to [pathCount](CompositeCollider2D-pathCount.html) minus 1.  
---|---  
points | An ordered list of the vertices (points) in the selected path.  
  
### Returns

**int** Returns the number of points placed in the `points` list.

### Description

Gets a path from the Collider by its index.

A _path_ is a cyclic sequence of line segments between points that define the
outline of the Collider. Since the Collider can have holes and discontinuous
parts, its shape is not necessarily defined by a single path.  
  
The integer return value is the number of results written into the `results`
list. The results list will be resized if it doesn't contain enough elements
to report all the results. This prevents memory from being allocated for
results when the `results` list does not need to be resized, and improves
garbage collection performance when the query is performed frequently.
