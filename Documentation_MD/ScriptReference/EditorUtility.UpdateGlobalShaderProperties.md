## Declaration

public static void UpdateGlobalShaderProperties(float time);

### Parameters

time | Time to use. -1 to disable.  
---|---  
  
### Description

Updates the global shader properties to use when rendering.

If the Editor is not in Play Mode, [Graphics.Blit](Graphics.Blit.html) will
not normally take time into consideration. Setting the internal time and
updating the global shader properties before doing a Blit will use the custom
time value when performing the Blit operation.
