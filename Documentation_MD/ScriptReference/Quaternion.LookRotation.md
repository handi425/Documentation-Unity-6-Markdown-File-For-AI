in the Manual")

## Declaration

public static [Quaternion](Quaternion.html)
LookRotation([Vector3](Vector3.html) forward, [Vector3](Vector3.html) upwards
= Vector3.up);

### Parameters

forward | The direction to look in.  
---|---  
upwards | The vector that defines in which direction up is.  
  
### Description

Creates a rotation with the specified `forward` and `upwards` directions.

Z axis will be aligned with `forward`, X axis aligned with cross product
between `forward` and `upwards`, and Y axis aligned with cross product between
Z and X.  
  
Returns identity if the magnitude of `forward` is zero.  
If `forward` and `upwards` are colinear, or if the magnitude of `upwards` is
zero, the result is the same as
[Quaternion.FromToRotation](Quaternion.FromToRotation.html) with
`fromDirection` set to the positive Z-axis (0, 0, 1) and `toDirection` set to
the normalized `forward` direction.

    
    
    // You can also use transform.LookAt  
      
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public [Transform](Transform.html) target;  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            [Vector3](Vector3.html) relativePos = target.position - transform.position;  
      
            // the second argument, upwards, defaults to [Vector3.up](Vector3-up.html)
            [Quaternion](Quaternion.html) rotation = [Quaternion.LookRotation](Quaternion.LookRotation.html)(relativePos, [Vector3.up](Vector3-up.html));
            transform.rotation = rotation;
        }
    }
