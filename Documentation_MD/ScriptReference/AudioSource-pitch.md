[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-AudioSource.html "Go to AudioSource
Component in the Manual")

public float pitch;

### Description

The pitch of the audio source.

Pitch makes a melody go higher or lower. For example, if you play an audio
clip with pitch set to one, increasing the pitch as the clip plays will make
the clip sound higher. Similarly, decreasing the pitch to less than one makes
the clip sound lower. When [resource](AudioSource-resource.html) is an
[AudioClip](AudioClip.html), the pitch property is clamped to the range
[-3..3]. When [resource](AudioSource-resource.html) is an
AudioRandomContainer, the pitch property is ignored, and if it is not in the
range [0.0001..3.0], a warning appears in the console. This is due to
AudioRandomContainer not supporting reverse/pause playback from the pitch. Any
values outside this range are clamped when changing from an
[AudioClip](AudioClip.html) to an AudioRandomContainer.

    
    
    //Attach this script to a [GameObject](GameObject.html).
    //Attach an [AudioSource](AudioSource.html) to your [GameObject](GameObject.html) (Click **Add Component** and go to **Audio** >**Audio Source**). Choose an audio clip in the **AudioClip** field.
    //This script sets the pitch of the audio at the start, and then gradually turns it down to 0 as time passes.  
      
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    //Make sure there is an Audio Source component on the [GameObject](GameObject.html)
    [[RequireComponent](RequireComponent.html)(typeof([AudioSource](AudioSource.html)))]  
      
    public class ExampleScript : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public int startingPitch = 4;
        public int timeToDecrease = 5;
        [AudioSource](AudioSource.html) audioSource;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            //Fetch the [AudioSource](AudioSource.html) from the [GameObject](GameObject.html)
            audioSource = GetComponent<[AudioSource](AudioSource.html)>();  
      
            //Initialize the pitch
            audioSource.pitch = startingPitch;
        }  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            //While the pitch is over 0, decrease it as time passes.
            if (audioSource.pitch > 0)
            {
                audioSource.pitch -= [Time.deltaTime](Time-deltaTime.html) * startingPitch / timeToDecrease;
            }
        }
    }
    

Another example:

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    // A script that plays your chosen song.  The pitch starts at 1.0.
    // You can increase and decrease the pitch and hear the change
    // that is made.  
      
    public class AudioExample : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public float pitchValue = 1.0f;
        public [AudioClip](AudioClip.html) mySong;  
      
        private [AudioSource](AudioSource.html) audioSource;
        private float low = 0.75f;
        private float high = 1.25f;  
      
        void Awake()
        {
            audioSource = GetComponent<[AudioSource](AudioSource.html)>();
            audioSource.clip = mySong;
            audioSource.loop = true;
        }  
      
        void OnGUI()
        {
            pitchValue = [GUI.HorizontalSlider](GUI.HorizontalSlider.html)(new [Rect](Rect.html)(25, 75, 100, 30), pitchValue, low, high);
            audioSource.pitch = pitchValue;
        }
    }
