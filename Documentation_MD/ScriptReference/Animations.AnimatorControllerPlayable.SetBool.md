## Declaration

public void SetBool(int id, bool value);

### Parameters

name | The parameter name.  
---|---  
id | The parameter ID.  
value | The new parameter value.  
  
### Description

Sets the value of the given boolean parameter.

Use AnimatorControllerPlayable.SetBool to pass Boolean values to an [Animator
Controller](../Manual/class-AnimatorController.html) via script.  
  
Use this to trigger transitions between states. For example, triggering a
death animation by setting an “alive” boolean to false. See documentation on
[Animation](../Manual/AnimatorControllerCreation.html) for more information on
setting up Animators.  
  
Note: You can identify the parameter by name or by ID number, but the name or
ID number must be the same as the parameter you want to change in the
AnimatorController.
