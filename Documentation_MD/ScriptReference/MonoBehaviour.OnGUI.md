Component in the Manual")

### Description

OnGUI is called for rendering and handling GUI events.

OnGUI is the only function that can implement the ["Immediate Mode" GUI
(IMGUI)](../Manual/GUIScriptingGuide.html) system for rendering and handling
GUI events. Your OnGUI implementation might be called several times per frame
(one call per event). For more information on GUI events see the
[Event](Event.html) reference. If the MonoBehaviour's enabled property is set
to false, OnGUI() will not be called.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void OnGUI()
        {
            if ([GUI.Button](GUI.Button.html)(new [Rect](Rect.html)(10, 10, 150, 100), "I am a button"))
            {
                print("You clicked the button!");
            }
        }
    }

Guide](../Manual/GUIScriptingGuide.html).
