## Declaration

public static void DrawMeshNow([Mesh](Mesh.html) mesh,
[Matrix4x4](Matrix4x4.html) matrix, int materialIndex);

### Parameters

mesh | The [Mesh](Mesh.html) to draw.  
---|---  
position | Position of the mesh.  
rotation | Rotation of the mesh.  
matrix | The transformation matrix of the mesh (combines position, rotation and other transformations).  
materialIndex | Subset of the mesh to draw.  
  
### Description

Draw a mesh immediately.

This function will draw a given mesh immediately. Currently set shader and
material (see [Material.SetPass](Material.SetPass.html)) will be used.  
  
The mesh will be just drawn once, it won't be per-pixel lit and will not cast
or receive real-time shadows. If you want full integration with lighting and
shadowing, use [Graphics.DrawMesh](Graphics.DrawMesh.html) instead.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    // Attach this script to a [Camera](Camera.html)
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html) {
        public [Mesh](Mesh.html) mesh;
        public [Material](Material.html) mat;
        public void OnPostRender() {
            // set first shader pass of the material
            mat.SetPass(0);
            // draw mesh at the origin
            [Graphics.DrawMeshNow](Graphics.DrawMeshNow.html)(mesh, [Vector3.zero](Vector3-zero.html), [Quaternion.identity](Quaternion-identity.html));
        }
    }
