### Description

The GrammarRecognizer is a complement to the KeywordRecognizer. In many cases
developers will find the KeywordRecognizer fills all their development needs.
However, in some cases, more complex grammars will be better expressed in the
form of an xml file on disk. The GrammarRecognizer uses Extensible Markup
Language (XML) elements and attributes, as specified in the World Wide Web
Consortium (W3C) Speech Recognition Grammar Specification (SRGS) Version 1.0.
These XML elements and attributes represent the rule structures that define
the words or phrases (commands) recognized by speech recognition engines.

For more information on this format, refer to [www.w3.org/TR/speech-
grammar](http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-grammar/) or on MSDN.  
  
There can be many grammar recognizers active at any given point in time, but
no two grammar recognizers may use the same grammar file.  
  
Grammar recognizer is currently functional only on Windows 10.
