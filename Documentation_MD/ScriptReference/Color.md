### Description

Representation of RGBA colors.

This structure is used throughout Unity to pass colors around. Each color
component is a floating point value with a range from 0 to 1.  
  
Components ([r](Color-r.html),[g](Color-g.html),[b](Color-b.html)) define a
color in RGB color space. Alpha component ([a](Color-a.html)) defines
transparency - alpha of one is completely opaque, alpha of zero is completely
transparent.

### Static Properties

[black](Color-black.html)| Solid black. RGBA is (0, 0, 0, 1).  
---|---  
[blue](Color-blue.html)| Solid blue. RGBA is (0, 0, 1, 1).  
[clear](Color-clear.html)| Completely transparent. RGBA is (0, 0, 0, 0).  
[cyan](Color-cyan.html)| Cyan. RGBA is (0, 1, 1, 1).  
[gray](Color-gray.html)| Gray. RGBA is (0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1).  
[green](Color-green.html)| Solid green. RGBA is (0, 1, 0, 1).  
[grey](Color-grey.html)| English spelling for gray. RGBA is the same (0.5,
0.5, 0.5, 1).  
[magenta](Color-magenta.html)| Magenta. RGBA is (1, 0, 1, 1).  
[red](Color-red.html)| Solid red. RGBA is (1, 0, 0, 1).  
[white](Color-white.html)| Solid white. RGBA is (1, 1, 1, 1).  
[yellow](Color-yellow.html)| Yellow. RGBA is (1, 0.92, 0.016, 1), but the
color is nice to look at!  
  
### Properties

[a](Color-a.html)| Alpha component of the color (0 is transparent, 1 is
opaque).  
---|---  
[b](Color-b.html)| Blue component of the color.  
[g](Color-g.html)| Green component of the color.  
[gamma](Color-gamma.html)| A version of the color that has had the gamma curve
applied.  
[grayscale](Color-grayscale.html)| The grayscale value of the color. (Read
Only)  
[linear](Color-linear.html)| A linear value of an sRGB color.  
[maxColorComponent](Color-maxColorComponent.html)| Returns the maximum color
component value: Max(r,g,b).  
[r](Color-r.html)| Red component of the color.  
[this[int]](Color.Index_operator.html)| Access the r, g, b,a components using
[0], [1], [2], [3] respectively.  
  
### Constructors

[Color](Color-ctor.html)| Constructs a new Color with given r,g,b,a
components.  
---|---  
  
### Public Methods

[ToString](Color.ToString.html)| Returns a formatted string of this color.  
---|---  
  
### Static Methods

[HSVToRGB](Color.HSVToRGB.html)| Creates an RGB colour from HSV input.  
---|---  
[Lerp](Color.Lerp.html)| Linearly interpolates between colors a and b by t.  
[LerpUnclamped](Color.LerpUnclamped.html)| Linearly interpolates between
colors a and b by t.  
[RGBToHSV](Color.RGBToHSV.html)| Calculates the hue, saturation and value of
an RGB input color.  
  
### Operators

[Color](Color-operator_Vector4.html)| Colors can be implicitly converted to
and from Vector4.  
---|---  
[operator -](Color-operator_subtract.html)| Subtracts color b from color a.
Each component is subtracted separately.  
[operator *](Color-operator_multiply.html)| Multiplies two colors together.
Each component is multiplied separately.  
[operator /](Color-operator_divide.html)| Divides color a by the float b. Each
color component is scaled separately.  
[operator +](Color-operator_add.html)| Adds two colors together. Each
component is added separately.  
[Vector4](Color-operator_Color.html)| Colors can be implicitly converted to
and from Vector4.
