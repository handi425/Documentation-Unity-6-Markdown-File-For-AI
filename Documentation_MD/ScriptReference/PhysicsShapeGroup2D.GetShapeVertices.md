## Declaration

public void GetShapeVertices(int shapeIndex, List<Vector2> vertices);

### Parameters

shapeIndex | The index of the shape stored in the [PhysicsShapeGroup2D](PhysicsShapeGroup2D.html). The shape index is zero-based with the shape group having a quantity of shapes specified by [shapeCount](PhysicsShapeGroup2D-shapeCount.html).  
---|---  
vertices | A list that will be populated with a copy of all the shape vertices in the [PhysicsShapeGroup2D](PhysicsShapeGroup2D.html).  
  
### Description

Gets a copy of the shape vertices in the
[PhysicsShapeGroup2D](PhysicsShapeGroup2D.html).

**NOTE** : Because this is a copy, changing the specified shape `vertices`
list afterwards will not change the
[PhysicsShapeGroup2D](PhysicsShapeGroup2D.html).

    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            // Create a shape group.
            var shapeGroup = new [PhysicsShapeGroup2D](PhysicsShapeGroup2D.html)();  
      
            // Add a Capsule to the shape group.
            var shapeIndex = shapeGroup.AddCapsule
                (
                    vertex0: [Vector2.down](Vector2-down.html),
                    vertex1: [Vector2.up](Vector2-up.html),
                    radius: 0.5f
                );  
      
    
            // Fetch the shape vertices from the shape group.
            var vertices = new List<[Vector2](Vector2.html)>();
            shapeGroup.GetShapeVertices(shapeIndex, vertices);  
      
            // validate the Capsule vertices (2).
            [Assert.AreEqual](Assertions.Assert.AreEqual.html)([Vector2.down](Vector2-down.html), vertices[0]);
            [Assert.AreEqual](Assertions.Assert.AreEqual.html)([Vector2.up](Vector2-up.html), vertices[1]);
        }
    }
