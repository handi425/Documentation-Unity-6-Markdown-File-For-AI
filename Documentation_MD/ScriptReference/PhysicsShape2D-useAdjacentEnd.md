public bool useAdjacentEnd;

### Description

When the value is true, then the shape will use the
[adjacentEnd](PhysicsShape2D-adjacentEnd.html) feature. When the value is
false, then the shape will not use the
[adjacentEnd](PhysicsShape2D-adjacentEnd.html) feature.

This property is identical to
[EdgeCollider2D.useAdjacentEndPoint](EdgeCollider2D-useAdjacentEndPoint.html).  
  
**NOTE** : This property is only used when the
[shapeType](PhysicsShape2D-shapeType.html) is
[PhysicsShapeType2D.Edges](PhysicsShapeType2D.Edges.html).

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
**Known Issue**. Please check with the Issue Tracker at
