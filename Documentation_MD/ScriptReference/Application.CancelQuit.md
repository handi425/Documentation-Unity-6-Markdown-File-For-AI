### Description

Cancels quitting the application. This is used for showing a splash screen at
the end of a game.

This function only works in the Player.  
  
**Note:** [CancelQuit](Application.CancelQuit.html) is deprecated. Use
[Application.wantsToQuit](Application-wantsToQuit.html) instead.  
  
**Note:** This function has no effect on iPhone. Application cannot prevent
termination under iPhone OS.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        // Delays quitting for 2 seconds and
        // loads the finalsplash level during that time.  
      
        float showSplashTimeout = 2.0f;
        bool  allowQuitting = false;  
      
        void Awake()
        {
            // This game object needs to survive multiple levels
            Application.DontDestroyOnLoad(this.gameObject);
        }  
      
        void OnApplicationQuit()
        {
            // If we haven't already load up the final splash screen level
            if (Application.loadedLevelName.ToLower() != "finalsplash")
            {
                StartCoroutine("DelayedQuit");
            }  
      
            // Don't allow the user to exit until we got permission in
            if (!allowQuitting)
            {
                Application.CancelQuit();
            }
        }  
      
        IEnumerator DelayedQuit()
        {
            Application.LoadLevel("finalsplash");  
      
            // Wait for showSplashTimeout
            yield return new [WaitForSeconds](WaitForSeconds.html)(showSplashTimeout);  
      
            // then quit for real
            allowQuitting = true;
            [Application.Quit](Application.Quit.html)();
        }
    }
