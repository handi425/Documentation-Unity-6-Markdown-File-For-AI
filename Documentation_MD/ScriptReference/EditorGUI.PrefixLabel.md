## Declaration

public static [Rect](Rect.html) PrefixLabel([Rect](Rect.html) totalPosition,
int id, [GUIContent](GUIContent.html) label, [GUIStyle](GUIStyle.html) style);

### Parameters

totalPosition | Rectangle on the screen to use in total for both the label and the control.  
---|---  
id | The unique ID of the control. If none specified, the ID of the following control is used.  
label | Label to show in front of the control.  
style | Style to use for the label.  
  
### Returns

**Rect** Rectangle on the screen to use just for the control itself.

### Description

Makes a label in front of some control.

![](../StaticFiles/ScriptRefImages/EditorGUIPrefixLabel.png)  
_Prefix Label in an Editor Window._  
  
Note that most editor controls already have built-in optional labels that can
be specified as one of the parameters. PrefixLabel can be used when there is
no such built-in label available, or when you're creating your own editor
control from scratch.  
  
PrefixLabel takes a rect that's the rect for the entire control, including the
label, and returns a rect that's for just the control itself, without the
label.  
  
PrefixLabel also ensures that when the label is clicked, the linked control
will get keyboard focus (if the control supports keyboard focus). The ID of
the linked control can optionally be specified, or if no ID is given, the
label is automatically linked to the following control coming after it.
