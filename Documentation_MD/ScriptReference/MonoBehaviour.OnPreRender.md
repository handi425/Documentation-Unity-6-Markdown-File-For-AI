[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-MonoBehaviour.html "Go to MonoBehaviour
Component in the Manual")

### Description

[Event function](../Manual/event-functions.html) that Unity calls before a
[Camera](Camera.html) renders the scene.

In the Built-in Render Pipeline, Unity calls `OnPreRender` on MonoBehaviours
that are attached to the same GameObject as an enabled [Camera](Camera.html)
component, just before that Camera renders the scene. Use `OnPreRender` to
execute your own code at this point in the render loop; for example, you could
change visual settings to affect the scene while a given Camera is rendering.
`OnPreRender` can be a coroutine.  
  
For similar functionality that does not require the script to be on the same
GameObject as a Camera component, see [Camera.onPreRender](Camera-
onPreRender.html). For similar functionality in the Scriptable Render
Pipeline, see [RenderPipelineManager](Rendering.RenderPipelineManager.html).  
  
Unity calls `OnPreRender` after the Camera performs its culling operation.
This means that if you make a change that affects what the Camera sees, the
change will take effect from the next frame. To make a change to what the
Camera sees in the current frame, use
[MonoBehaviour.OnPreCull](MonoBehaviour.OnPreCull.html).  
  
When Unity calls `OnPreRender`, the Camera's render target and depth textures
are not yet set up. If you need to access these, you can execute code later in
the render loop using a [CommandBuffer](Rendering.CommandBuffer.html).

    
    
    // This script lets you enable/disable fog per camera.
    // by enabling or disabling the script in the title of the Inspector
    // you can turn fog on or off per camera.  
      
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        private bool revertFogState = false;  
      
        void OnPreRender()
        {
            revertFogState = [RenderSettings.fog](RenderSettings-fog.html);
            [RenderSettings.fog](RenderSettings-fog.html) = enabled;
        }  
      
        void OnPostRender()
        {
            [RenderSettings.fog](RenderSettings-fog.html) = revertFogState;
        }
    }
