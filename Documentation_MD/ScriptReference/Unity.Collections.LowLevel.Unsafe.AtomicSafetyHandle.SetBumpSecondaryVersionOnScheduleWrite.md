## Declaration

public static void
SetBumpSecondaryVersionOnScheduleWrite([Unity.Collections.LowLevel.Unsafe.AtomicSafetyHandle](Unity.Collections.LowLevel.Unsafe.AtomicSafetyHandle.html)
handle, bool value);

### Parameters

handle | The AtomicSafetyHandle to check.  
---|---  
value | Use `true` to bump the secondary version number on schedule.  
  
### Description

Sets whether to automatically bump the secondary version when scheduling a job
that has write access to the AtomicSafetyHandle.

For example, NativeList sets this on its AtomicSafetyHandle, which cause any
aliased NativeArrays (created using `AsArray()`) to be invalidated whenever a
job is scheduled that uses this NativeList without the `[ReadOnly]` attribute.  
  
For more information about container version numbers, refer to [Copying
NativeContainer structures](../Manual/job-system-copy-nativecontainer.html).
