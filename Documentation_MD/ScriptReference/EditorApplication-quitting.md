### Description

Unity raises this event when the editor application is quitting.

Add an event handler to this event to receive a notification that the
application is quitting.  
  
Note that this will not fire if the Editor is forced to quit or if there is a
crash. This event is raised when the quitting process cannot be cancelled.  
  
To prevent the EditorApplication from quitting look at the
[EditorApplication.wantsToQuit](EditorApplication-wantsToQuit.html) event.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);  
      
    // Ensure class initializer is called whenever scripts recompile
    [InitializeOnLoad]
    public class EditorQuitExample
    {
        static void Quit()
        {
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("Quitting the [Editor](Editor.html)");
        }  
      
        static EditorQuitExample()
        {
            [EditorApplication.quitting](EditorApplication-quitting.html) += Quit;
        }
    }
