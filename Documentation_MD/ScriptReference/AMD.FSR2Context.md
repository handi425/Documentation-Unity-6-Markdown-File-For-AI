### Description

Represents the state of FSR2.

This class must be persistent, since internally it keeps track of history
buffers and other important implementation details. To modify the results of
FSR2, alter values in the ExecuteData property and then run
[GraphicsDevice.ExecuteFSR2](AMD.GraphicsDevice.ExecuteFSR2.html).

### Properties

[executeData](AMD.FSR2Context-executeData.html)| The mutable state of the
current FSR2 object.  
---|---  
[initData](AMD.FSR2Context-initData.html)| The immutable initialization data
the DLSSContext requires.
