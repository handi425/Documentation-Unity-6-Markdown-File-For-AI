**Obsolete** PlatformEffector2D.sideAngleVariance has been deprecated. Use
PlatformEffector2D.sideArc instead.  
**Upgrade to[sideArc](PlatformEffector2D-sideArc.html)** public float
sideAngleVariance;

### Description

The angle variance centered on the sides of the platform. Zero angle only
matches sides 90-degree to the platform "top".

Increasing the`sideAngleVariance` allows the definition of what is a "side" to
be expanded beyond the surfaces perpendicular to the platform "top". For
instance, if the [Effector2D](Effector2D.html) source was a
[CircleCollider2D](CircleCollider2D.html) then the sides could be set to an
arc on either side of the circle.  
  
Additional resources: [sideBounce](PlatformEffector2D-sideBounce.html),
[sideFriction](PlatformEffector2D-sideFriction.html).
