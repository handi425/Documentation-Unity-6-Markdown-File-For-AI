## Declaration

public static RaycastHit[] CapsuleCastAll([Vector3](Vector3.html) point1,
[Vector3](Vector3.html) point2, float radius, [Vector3](Vector3.html)
direction, float maxDistance = Mathf.Infinity, int layerMask =
DefaultRaycastLayers, [QueryTriggerInteraction](QueryTriggerInteraction.html)
queryTriggerInteraction = QueryTriggerInteraction.UseGlobal);

### Parameters

point1 | The center of the sphere at the `start` of the capsule.  
---|---  
point2 | The center of the sphere at the `end` of the capsule.  
radius | The radius of the capsule.  
direction | The direction into which to sweep the capsule.  
maxDistance | The max length of the sweep.  
layermask | A [Layer mask](../Manual/Layers.html) that is used to selectively ignore colliders when casting a capsule.  
queryTriggerInteraction | Specifies whether this query should hit Triggers.  
  
### Returns

**RaycastHit[]** An array of all colliders hit in the sweep.

### Description

Like [Physics.CapsuleCast](Physics.CapsuleCast.html), but this function will
return all hits the capsule sweep intersects.

Casts a capsule against all colliders in the Scene and returns detailed
information on each collider which was hit. The capsule is defined by the two
spheres with `radius` around `point1` and `point2`, which form the two ends of
the capsule. Hits are returned all colliders which would collide against this
capsule if the capsule was moved along `direction`. This is useful when a
Raycast does not give enough precision, because you want to find out if an
object of a specific size, such as a character, will be able to move somewhere
without colliding with anything on the way.  
  
**Notes:** For colliders that overlap the capsule at the start of the sweep,
[RaycastHit.normal](RaycastHit-normal.html) is set opposite to the direction
of the sweep, [RaycastHit.distance](RaycastHit-distance.html) is set to zero,
and the zero vector gets returned in [RaycastHit.point](RaycastHit-
point.html). You might want to check whether this is the case in your
particular query and perform additional queries to refine the result. Passing
a zero radius results in undefined output and doesn't always behave the same
as [Physics.Raycast](Physics.Raycast.html).
