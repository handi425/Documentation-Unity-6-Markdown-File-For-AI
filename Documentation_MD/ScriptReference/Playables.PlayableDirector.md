### Description

Instantiates a [PlayableGraph](Playables.PlayableGraph.html) from a
[PlayableAsset](Playables.PlayableAsset.html) and controls playback of
[Playable](Playables.Playable.html) objects.  
This API is mainly designed to provide scheduling and scene binding support
and scheduling for the Timeline package. Our users may find limited use for it
otherwise.  
Most of the functionality of this class can be replicated by using
[PlayableGraph](Playables.PlayableGraph.html).
