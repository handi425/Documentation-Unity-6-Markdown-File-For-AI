**Obsolete** This API is obsolete, and should no longer be used. Please use
the TrackedPoseDriver in the Legacy Input Helpers package for controlling a
camera in XR. public static bool disablePositionalTracking;

### Description

Disables positional tracking in XR. This takes effect the next time the head
pose is sampled. If set to true the camera only tracks headset rotation state.

This will disable the neck model in seated XR experiences. The only positional
component remaining is the space between the eyes.  
  
This functionality is most useful for 360 video use case where you don't want
to allow the head to translate at all.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
