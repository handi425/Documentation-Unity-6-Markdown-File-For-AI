### Description

Called as the new window is opened.

[Awake](EditorWindow.Awake.html)() message is called as a new editor window
starts. This is similar to how an [Awake](EditorWindow.Awake.html)() is called
as an GameObject starts.

    
    
    // Show how Awake is called as an [Editor](Editor.html) Window starts
    // In the script, the Awake message changes the string variable.
    
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.UIElements;
    
    public class AwakeExample : [EditorWindow](EditorWindow.html)
    {
        static string s_Text = "hello";
    
        [[MenuItem](MenuItem.html)("Examples/Awake Example")]
    
        public static void ShowExample()
        {
            AwakeExample wnd = GetWindow<AwakeExample>();
            wnd.titleContent = new [GUIContent](GUIContent.html)("AwakeExample");
        }
    
        public void CreateGUI()
        {
            var label = new [Label](UIElements.Label.html)("Text: " + s_Text);
            rootVisualElement.Add(label);
        }
    
        public void Awake()
        {
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("Awake");
            s_Text = "demo";
        }
    
        public void OnDestroy()
        {
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("OnDestroy");
        }
    }
