### Description

Automatically deallocates a native container when a job is finished.

Use this attribute on native container fields marked with
[NativeContainerSupportsDeallocateOnJobCompletionAttribute](Unity.Collections.LowLevel.Unsafe.NativeContainerSupportsDeallocateOnJobCompletionAttribute.html)
in a job struct. In particular, fields of type NativeArray can be
automatically deallocated with this attribute. When the job finishes
execution, the job system automatically deallocates the native container.
