## Declaration

public static [AnimationCurve](AnimationCurve.html)
GetEditorCurve([AnimationClip](AnimationClip.html) clip, string relativePath,
Type type, string propertyName);

## Declaration

public static [AnimationCurve](AnimationCurve.html)
GetEditorCurve([AnimationClip](AnimationClip.html) clip,
[EditorCurveBinding](EditorCurveBinding.html) binding);

### Description

Retrieves the float curve that the binding points to.

Unity internally combines position curves, scale curves, and rotation curves.
When curves are combined, keyframes are set at the union of all keyframes
points. In the Editor AnimationClip, you can specify special editor curves
that are not combined and allows the user to edit curves in a more intuitive
way.
