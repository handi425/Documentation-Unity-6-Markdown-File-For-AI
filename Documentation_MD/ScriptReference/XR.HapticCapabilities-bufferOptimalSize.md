public uint bufferOptimalSize;

### Description

The optimal buffer size an [InputDevice](XR.InputDevice.html) expects to be
sent via [InputDevice.SendHapticBuffer](XR.InputDevice.SendHapticBuffer.html)
in order to provide a continuous rumble between individual frames.

Check that the device supports haptic buffers via
[InputDevice.TryGetHapticCapabilities](XR.InputDevice.TryGetHapticCapabilities.html)
and [HapticCapabilities.supportsBuffer](XR.HapticCapabilities-
supportsBuffer.html). Will be set to 0 if
[HapticCapabilities.supportsBuffer](XR.HapticCapabilities-supportsBuffer.html)
is false.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
**Known Issue**. Please check with the Issue Tracker at
