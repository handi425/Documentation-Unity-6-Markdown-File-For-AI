## Declaration

public void SetShaderPassEnabled(string passName, bool enabled);

### Parameters

passName | Shader pass name (case insensitive).  
---|---  
enabled | Flag indicating whether this Shader pass should be enabled.  
  
### Description

Enables or disables a Shader pass on a per-Material level.

By default, all Shader passes are enabled. This function allows a Material to
treat a specific Shader pass (as indicated by LightMode pass tag) as if it
does not exist in the Shader. For example, if the Shader has a "refraction"
pass but you only want to enable it on Materials that have a refraction
Texture assigned, pass "refraction" as `passName` and false for `enabled` for
Materials without a refraction Texture assigned.
