[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-GameObject.html "Go to GameObject Component
in the Manual")

## Declaration

public [Component](Component.html) GetComponentAtIndex(int index);

### Parameters

index | The index position in the array of components at which to find the requested object.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**Component** A reference to a component at the specified index. If no
component is found at the specified index, returns `null`.

### Description

Retrieves a reference to a component at a specified index of the GameObject's
array of components.

Using `GetComponentAtIndex` is a stable way to access components on a
GameObject because the index of a component stays the same unless components
are added or removed.  
  
An example use case for this is during UI development. This method throws an
exception if the index is out of bounds. Refer to
[GameObject.GetComponentCount](GameObject.GetComponentCount.html) for more
information.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class GetComponentAtIndexExample : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public [GameObject](GameObject.html) otherGameObject;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            [HingeJoint](HingeJoint.html) hinge = otherGameObject.GetComponentAtIndex(5) as [HingeJoint](HingeJoint.html);  
      
            if (hinge != null)
            {
                hinge.useSpring = false;
            }
        }
    }
