ArticulationBody Component in the Manual")

## Declaration

public int GetDenseJacobian(ref
[ArticulationJacobian](ArticulationJacobian.html) jacobian);

### Parameters

jacobian | Supplied struct to read back and store Jacobian matrix values.   
---|---  
  
### Returns

**int** Number of elements in Jacobian matrix.

### Description

Calculates and writes dense Jacobian matrix of the articulation body hierarchy
to the supplied struct.

This calculates dense Jacobian matrix of the entire articulation body
hierarchy starting from root articulation body. Number of rows
[ArticulationJacobian.rows](ArticulationJacobian-rows.html) of the matrix is
equal to the number of articulation bodies in hierarchy times 6: 3 rows of
linear/positional DOF and 3 rows of angular/rotational DOF for each body.
Number of columns [ArticulationJacobian.columns](ArticulationJacobian-
columns.html) of the matrix is equal to the total number of all joints degrees
of freedom(DOF), plus 6 if [ArticulationBody.immovable](ArticulationBody-
immovable.html) is false. Additional resources: [index](ArticulationBody-
index.html), [ArticulationJacobian](ArticulationJacobian.html),
[GetDofStartIndices](ArticulationBody.GetDofStartIndices.html).
