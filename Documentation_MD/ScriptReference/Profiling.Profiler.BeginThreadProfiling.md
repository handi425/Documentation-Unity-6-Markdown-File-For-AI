## Declaration

public static void BeginThreadProfiling(string threadGroupName, string
threadName);

### Parameters

threadGroupName | The name of the thread group to which the thread belongs.  
---|---  
threadName | The name of the thread.  
  
### Description

Enables profiling on the thread from which you call this method.

Makes the thread show up with its registered name in the Profiler Timeline
View, showing the duration of each sample on the thread. Samples which cross
frame boundaries are sliced and might contribute time to multiple frames.  
  
**Note:** Calling this method on an internal Unity thread (such as main
thread, render thread or job system threads) has no effect.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.Profiling;
    using System.Threading;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        [CustomSampler](Profiling.CustomSampler.html) sampler;
        void Start()
        {
            sampler = [CustomSampler.Create](Profiling.CustomSampler.Create.html)("MyCustomSampler");
            var thread = new Thread(MyThreadFunc) { IsBackground = true };
            thread.Start();
        }  
      
        void MyThreadFunc()
        {
            [Profiler.BeginThreadProfiling](Profiling.Profiler.BeginThreadProfiling.html)("My threads", "My thread 1");
            // Now samples will show up in the profiler timeline view
            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
            {
                sampler.Begin();
                // ...
                sampler.End();
            }  
      
            // Unregister the thread before exit
            [Profiler.EndThreadProfiling](Profiling.Profiler.EndThreadProfiling.html)();
        }
    }
    

**Note:**
[Profiler.EndThreadProfiling](Profiling.Profiler.EndThreadProfiling.html)
should always be called before thread destruction to free internal resources.
