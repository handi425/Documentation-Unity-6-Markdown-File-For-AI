### Description

Allows random write access into this
[GraphicsTexture](Rendering.GraphicsTexture.html) on Shader Model 5.0 level
shaders.

Allows Shader Model 5.0 level pixel or compute shaders to write into arbitrary
locations on this texture, called "unordered access views" in
[UsingDX11GL3Features](../Manual/UsingDX11GL3Features.html). Note that this
flag does nothing if
[GraphicsTextureDescriptorFlags.RenderTarget](Rendering.GraphicsTextureDescriptorFlags.RenderTarget.html)
is not also set.
[GraphicsTextureDescriptor.numSamples](Rendering.GraphicsTextureDescriptor-
numSamples.html) must be 1, as random write access is not compatible with
anti-aliasing.  
  
Additional resources: [RenderTexture.enableRandomWrite](RenderTexture-
enableRandomWrite.html).
