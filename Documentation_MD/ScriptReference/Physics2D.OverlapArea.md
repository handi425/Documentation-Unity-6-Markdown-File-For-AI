## Declaration

public static [Collider2D](Collider2D.html)
OverlapArea([Vector2](Vector2.html) pointA, [Vector2](Vector2.html) pointB,
int layerMask = DefaultRaycastLayers, float minDepth = -Mathf.Infinity, float
maxDepth = Mathf.Infinity);

### Parameters

pointA | One corner of the rectangle.  
---|---  
pointB | Diagonally opposite the point A corner of the rectangle.  
layerMask | Filter to check objects only on specific layers.  
minDepth | Only include objects with a Z coordinate (depth) greater than or equal to this value.  
maxDepth | Only include objects with a Z coordinate (depth) less than or equal to this value.  
  
### Returns

**Collider2D** The Collider overlapping the area.

### Description

Checks if a Collider falls within a rectangular area.

The rectangle is defined by two diagonally opposite corner coordinates in
world space. You can think of these as top-left and bottom-right but the test
will still work if the ordering of the points is reversed. The optional
_layerMask_ allows the test to check only for objects on specific layers.  
  
Although the Z axis is not relevant for rendering or collisions in 2D, you can
use the _minDepth_ and _maxDepth_ parameters to filter objects based on their
Z coordinate. If more than one Collider falls within the area then the one
returned will be the one with the lowest Z coordinate value. Null is returned
if there are no Colliders in the area.

## Declaration

public static int OverlapArea([Vector2](Vector2.html) pointA,
[Vector2](Vector2.html) pointB, [ContactFilter2D](ContactFilter2D.html)
contactFilter, Collider2D[] results);

### Parameters

pointA | One corner of the rectangle.  
---|---  
pointB | Diagonally opposite the point A corner of the rectangle.  
contactFilter | The contact filter used to filter the results differently, such as by layer mask, Z depth. Note that normal angle is not used for overlap testing.  
results | The array to receive results. The size of the array determines the maximum number of results that can be returned.  
  
### Returns

**int** Returns the number of results placed in the `results` array.

### Description

Checks if a Collider falls within a rectangular area.

This function returns the number of Colliders found and places those Colliders
in the `results` array.

## Declaration

public static int OverlapArea([Vector2](Vector2.html) pointA,
[Vector2](Vector2.html) pointB, [ContactFilter2D](ContactFilter2D.html)
contactFilter, List<Collider2D> results);

### Parameters

pointA | One corner of the rectangle.  
---|---  
pointB | Diagonally opposite the point A corner of the rectangle.  
contactFilter | The contact filter used to filter the results differently, such as by layer mask, Z depth. Note that normal angle is not used for overlap testing.  
results | The list to receive results.  
  
### Returns

**int** Returns the number of results placed in the `results` list.

### Description

Checks if a Collider falls within a rectangular area.

The integer return value is the number of results written into the `results`
list. The results list will be resized if it doesn't contain enough elements
to report all the results. This prevents memory from being allocated for
results when the `results` list does not need to be resized, and improves
garbage collection performance when the query is performed frequently.
