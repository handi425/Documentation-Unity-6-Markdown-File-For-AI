## Declaration

public static float Angle([Vector3](Vector3.html) from,
[Vector3](Vector3.html) to);

### Parameters

from | The vector from which the angular difference is measured.  
---|---  
to | The vector to which the angular difference is measured.  
  
### Returns

**float** The angle in degrees between the two vectors.

### Description

Calculates the angle between two vectors.

The angle returned is the angle of rotation from the first vector to the
second, when treating these two vector inputs as directions.  
Note: The angle returned will always be between 0 and 180 degrees, because the
method returns the smallest angle between the vectors. That is, it will never
return a reflex angle.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class AngleExample : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public [Transform](Transform.html) target;  
      
        // prints "close" if the z-axis of this transform looks
        // almost towards the target  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            [Vector3](Vector3.html) targetDir = target.position - transform.position;
            float angle = [Vector3.Angle](Vector3.Angle.html)(targetDir, transform.forward);  
      
            if (angle < 5.0f)
                print("Close");
        }
    }
