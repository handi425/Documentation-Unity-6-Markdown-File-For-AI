positions);

**Obsolete** Please use UnityEngine.LightTransport.IProbeIntegrator instead.

## Declaration

public static void SetAdditionalBakedProbes(int id, ReadOnlySpan<Vector3>
positions, bool dering);

### Parameters

id | An ID to identify the positions to be baked. This ID is used later to retrieve the result for those positions.  
---|---  
positions | An array of probe positions.  
dering | A boolean that determines if Unity should remove ringing from probes.  
  
### Description

Submit additional probe positions to be baked using an identifier.

Additional baked probes are probes that can be baked independently of any
Light Probe Groups. The baked probe data contains spherical harmonic L2
coefficients as well as a single float value to determine the validity of each
probe. By setting an array of probe positions with an identifier, a successive
bake will produce probe results for these positions, which can then be fetched
again from the API using the identifier.
