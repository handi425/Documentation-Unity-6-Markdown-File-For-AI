in the Manual")

## Declaration

public void AddForceAtPosition([Vector3](Vector3.html) force,
[Vector3](Vector3.html) position, [ForceMode](ForceMode.html) mode =
ForceMode.Force);

### Parameters

force | Force vector in world coordinates.  
---|---  
position | Position in world coordinates.  
  
### Description

Applies `force` at `position`. As a result this will apply a torque and force
on the object.

For realistic effects `position` should be approximately in the range of the
surface of the rigidbody. This is most commonly used for explosions. When
applying explosions it is best to apply forces over several frames instead of
just one. Note that when `position` is far away from the center of the
rigidbody the applied torque will be unrealistically large.  
  
Force can be applied only to an active rigidbody. If a GameObject is inactive,
AddForceAtPosition has no effect.  
  
Wakes up the Rigidbody by default. If the force size is zero then the
Rigidbody will not be woken up.  
  
For more information on how ForceMode affects velocity, see
[Rigidbody.AddForce](Rigidbody.AddForce.html).
