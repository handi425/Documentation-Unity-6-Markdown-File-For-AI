## Declaration

public void TakePhotoAsync(string filename,
[Windows.WebCam.PhotoCaptureFileOutputFormat](Windows.WebCam.PhotoCaptureFileOutputFormat.html)
fileOutputFormat,
[Windows.WebCam.PhotoCapture.OnCapturedToDiskCallback](Windows.WebCam.PhotoCapture.OnCapturedToDiskCallback.html)
onCapturedPhotoToDiskCallback);

## Declaration

public void
TakePhotoAsync([Windows.WebCam.PhotoCapture.OnCapturedToMemoryCallback](Windows.WebCam.PhotoCapture.OnCapturedToMemoryCallback.html)
onCapturedPhotoToMemoryCallback);

### Parameters

filename | The location where the photo should be saved. The filename must end with a png or jpg file extension.  
---|---  
fileOutputFormat | The encoding format that should be used.  
onCapturedPhotoToDiskCallback | Invoked once the photo has been saved to disk.  
onCapturedPhotoToMemoryCallback | Invoked once the photo has been copied to the target texture.  
  
### Description

Asynchronously captures a photo from the web camera and saves it to disk.

This method can either be used in two ways. You can use this method to capture
a photo from the web camera directly into CPU memory. You can then apply the
image data to a texture for use in Unity or pass the image data to an external
plugin. When capturing a photo directly to memory, you will also be provided
with spatial information that will allow you to know where the image was taken
spatially. You can also capture a photo directly to disk as either a png or
jpg.  
  
[EXIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchangeable_image_file_format) metadata
will be encoded into the captured image when saving the image in the JPEG
format. You may save the captured image in the JPEG format when using the
BGRA32 and NV12 pixel formats. You may only save the captured image as a PNG
when using the BGRA32 pixel format.  
  
This example will capture an Image from the Web Camera and save it to disk.
