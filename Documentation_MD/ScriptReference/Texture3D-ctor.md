## Declaration

public Texture3D(int width, int height, int depth,
[TextureFormat](TextureFormat.html) textureFormat, bool mipChain, bool
createUninitialized = false);

## Declaration

public Texture3D(int width, int height, int depth,
[TextureFormat](TextureFormat.html) textureFormat, bool mipChain, IntPtr
nativeTex = IntPtr.Zero);

## Declaration

public Texture3D(int width, int height, int depth,
[TextureFormat](TextureFormat.html) textureFormat, int mipCount, IntPtr
nativeTex = IntPtr.Zero);

## Declaration

public Texture3D(int width, int height, int depth,
[TextureFormat](TextureFormat.html) textureFormat, int mipCount, IntPtr
nativeTex = IntPtr.Zero, bool createUninitialized = false);

### Parameters

width | Width of texture in pixels.  
---|---  
height | Height of texture in pixels.  
depth | Depth of texture in pixels.  
textureFormat | Texture data format.  
mipChain | Determines whether the texture has mipmaps or not. A value of 1 (true) means the texture does have mipmaps, and a value of 0 (false) means the texture doesn't have mipmaps.  
nativeTex | External native texture pointer to use. Defaults to generating its own internal native texture.  
mipCount | Amount of mipmaps to allocate for the texture.  
createUninitialized | Use this flag to create the texture with uninitialized data. When overriding all texels anyway, this can lead to improved performance and reduced memory usage.  
  
### Description

Create a new empty 3D Texture.

3D textures can be thought of as a box of pixels, with width, height and
depth. Note that large textures can consume a lot of memory, for example a
1024x512x256 texture with [TextureFormat.ARGB32](TextureFormat.ARGB32.html)
format and no mipmaps will consume 512MB of memory.  
  
Note that this class does not support Texture3D creation with a Crunch
compression [TextureFormat](TextureFormat.html).  
  
Enable `createUninitialized` to make the texture reference uninitialized data
(both on the CPU and GPU). When overriding all texels, this can lead to
improved performance and reduced memory usage during construction. Note that
sampling an uninitialized texture gives unpredictable values.
