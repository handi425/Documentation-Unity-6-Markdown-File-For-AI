public string locationPathName;

### Description

The path where the application will be built.

The path you specify should end with the correct extension for the file format
you will build. This path won't be changed by Unity. Set the file format using
[EditorUserBuildSettings.buildAppBundle](EditorUserBuildSettings-
buildAppBundle.html).  

  * If your file is an Android Package, end `locationPathName` with `.apk`.
  * If your file is an Android App Bundle, end `locationPathName` with `.aab`.
