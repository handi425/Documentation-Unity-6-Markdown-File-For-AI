## Declaration

public static [RaycastHit2D](RaycastHit2D.html)
Raycast([Vector2](Vector2.html) origin, [Vector2](Vector2.html) direction,
float distance = Mathf.Infinity, int layerMask = DefaultRaycastLayers, float
minDepth = -Mathf.Infinity, float maxDepth = Mathf.Infinity);

### Parameters

origin | The point in 2D space where the ray originates.  
---|---  
direction | A vector representing the direction of the ray.  
distance | The maximum distance over which to cast the ray.  
layerMask | Filter to detect Colliders only on certain layers.  
minDepth | Only include objects with a Z coordinate (depth) greater than or equal to this value.  
maxDepth | Only include objects with a Z coordinate (depth) less than or equal to this value.  
  
### Returns

**RaycastHit2D** The cast results returned.

### Description

Casts a ray against Colliders in the Scene.

A _raycast_ is conceptually like a laser beam that is fired from a point in
space along a particular direction. Any object making contact with the beam
can be detected and reported.  
  
This function returns a RaycastHit2D object with a reference to the Collider
that is hit by the ray (the Collider property of the result will be NULL if
nothing was hit). The _layerMask_ can be used to detect objects selectively
only on certain layers (this allows you to apply the detection only to enemy
characters, for example).  
  
Overloads of this method that use `contactFilter` can filter the results by
the options available in [ContactFilter2D](ContactFilter2D.html).  
  
Raycasts are useful for determining lines of sight, targets hit by gunfire and
for many other purposes in gameplay.  
  
Additionally, this will also detect Collider(s) at the start of the ray. In
this case, the ray starts inside the Collider and doesn't intersect the
Collider surface. This means that the collision normal cannot be calculated,
in which case the returned collision normal is set to the inverse of the ray
vector being tested. This can easily be detected because such results are
always at a RaycastHit2D fraction of zero.

            {
                // Calculate the distance from the surface and the "error" relative
                // to the floating height.
                float distance = [Mathf.Abs](Mathf.Abs.html)(hit.point.y - transform.position.y);
                float heightError = floatHeight - distance;  
      
                // The force is proportional to the height error, but we remove a part of it
                // according to the object's speed.

## Declaration

public static int Raycast([Vector2](Vector2.html) origin,
[Vector2](Vector2.html) direction, [ContactFilter2D](ContactFilter2D.html)
contactFilter, RaycastHit2D[] results, float distance = Mathf.Infinity);

### Parameters

origin | The point in 2D space where the ray originates.  
---|---  
direction | A vector representing the direction of the ray.  
contactFilter | The contact filter used to filter the results differently, such as by layer mask, Z depth, or normal angle.  
results | The array to receive results. The size of the array determines the maximum number of results that can be returned.  
distance | The maximum distance over which to cast the ray.  
  
### Returns

**int** Returns the number of results placed in the `results` array.

### Description

Casts a ray against Colliders in the Scene.

This function returns the number of contacts found and places those contacts
in the `results` array. The results can also be filtered by the
`contactFilter`.

## Declaration

public static int Raycast([Vector2](Vector2.html) origin,
[Vector2](Vector2.html) direction, [ContactFilter2D](ContactFilter2D.html)
contactFilter, List<RaycastHit2D> results, float distance = Mathf.Infinity);

### Parameters

origin | The point in 2D space where the ray originates.  
---|---  
direction | A vector representing the direction of the ray.  
contactFilter | The contact filter used to filter the results differently, such as by layer mask, Z depth, or normal angle.  
results | The list to receive results.  
distance | The maximum distance over which to cast the ray.  
  
### Returns

**int** Returns the number of results placed in the `results` list.

### Description

Casts a ray against Colliders in the Scene.

The integer return value is the number of results written into the `results`
list. The results list will be resized if it doesn't contain enough elements
to report all the results. This prevents memory from being allocated for
results when the `results` list does not need to be resized, and improves
garbage collection performance when the query is performed frequently.  
  
The results can also be filtered by the `contactFilter`.
