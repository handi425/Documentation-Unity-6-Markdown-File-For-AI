## Declaration

public static [Vector3](Vector3.html) ScaleHandle([Vector3](Vector3.html)
scale, [Vector3](Vector3.html) position, [Quaternion](Quaternion.html)
rotation, float size);

### Parameters

scale | Scale to modify.  
---|---  
position | The position of the handle.  
rotation | The rotation of the handle.  
size | Allows you to scale the size of the handle on-screen.  
  
### Returns

**Vector3** The new value modified by the user's interaction with the handle.
If the user has not moved the handle, it will return the same value as you
passed into the function.

### Description

Make a Scene view scale handle.

This will behave like the built-in scale tool  
  
**Note:** Use [HandleUtility.GetHandleSize](HandleUtility.GetHandleSize.html)
where you might want to have constant screen-sized handles.  
  
![](../StaticFiles/ScriptRefImages/ScaleHandle.png)  
_Scale handle that will appear whenever you select the GameObject._

    
    
    // Name this script "ScaleAtPointEditor"
    using UnityEngine;
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);  
      
    [[CustomEditor](CustomEditor.html)(typeof(ScaleAtPoint))]
    [[CanEditMultipleObjects](CanEditMultipleObjects.html)]
    public class ScaleAtPointEditor : [Editor](Editor.html)
    {
        public void OnSceneGUI()
        {
            ScaleAtPoint t = (target as ScaleAtPoint);  
      
            [EditorGUI.BeginChangeCheck](EditorGUI.BeginChangeCheck.html)();
            [Vector3](Vector3.html) scale = [Handles.ScaleHandle](Handles.ScaleHandle.html)(t.scale, [Vector3.zero](Vector3-zero.html), [Quaternion.identity](Quaternion-identity.html), 1);
            if ([EditorGUI.EndChangeCheck](EditorGUI.EndChangeCheck.html)())
            {
                [Undo.RecordObject](Undo.RecordObject.html)(target, "Scaled ScaleAt Point");
                t.scale = scale;
                t.Update();
            }
        }
    }
    

And the script Attached to this GameObject:

    
    
    // Name this script "ScaleAtPoint"
    using UnityEngine;
    [[ExecuteInEditMode](ExecuteInEditMode.html)]
    public class ScaleAtPoint : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public [Vector3](Vector3.html) scale = [Vector3.one](Vector3-one.html);
        public void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            transform.localScale = scale;
        }
    }
