## Declaration

public static bool
MatchSearchGroups([Search.SearchContext](Search.SearchContext.html) context,
string content, bool ignoreCase);

### Parameters

context | Search context containing the searchQuery that search tries to match.  
---|---  
content | String content that is tokenized and used to match the search query.  
ignoreCase | Perform matching while ignoring letter casing.  
  
### Returns

**bool** If a match has occurred.

### Description

Helper function to match a string against the SearchContext. This will try to
match the search query against each token of content (similar to the
AddComponent menu workflow).

    
    
    private static IEnumerable<[SearchItem](Search.SearchItem.html)> SearchLogs([SearchContext](Search.SearchContext.html) context, [SearchProvider](Search.SearchProvider.html) provider)
    {
        lock (s_Logs)
        {
            if (!s_Initialized)
            {
                s_Initialized = true;
                [Application.logMessageReceived](Application-logMessageReceived.html) -= HandleLog;
                [Application.logMessageReceived](Application-logMessageReceived.html) += HandleLog;
            }
            for (int logIndex = 0; logIndex < s_Logs.Count; ++logIndex)
                yield return SearchLogEntry(context, provider, s_Logs[logIndex]);
        }
    }
