public static int LINE_STRIP;

### Description

Mode for [Begin](GL.Begin.html): draw line strip.

Draws lines between each vertex passed, from the beginning to the end. If you
pass three vertices, A, B and C, two lines are drawn: one between A and B, and
one between B and C.  
  
To set up the screen for drawing in 2D, use [GL.LoadOrtho](GL.LoadOrtho.html)
or [GL.LoadPixelMatrix](GL.LoadPixelMatrix.html). To set up the screen for
drawing in 3D, use [GL.LoadIdentity](GL.LoadIdentity.html) followed by
[GL.MultMatrix](GL.MultMatrix.html) with the desired transformation matrix.  
  
Additional resources: [GL.Begin](GL.Begin.html), [GL.End](GL.End.html).
