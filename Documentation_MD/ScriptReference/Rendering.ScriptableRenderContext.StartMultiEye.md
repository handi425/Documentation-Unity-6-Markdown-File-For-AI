### Parameters

camera | Camera to enable stereo rendering on.  
---|---  
eye | The current eye to be rendered.  
  
### Description

Schedules a fine-grained beginning of stereo rendering on the
ScriptableRenderContext.

Activates stereo rendering on the
[ScriptableRenderContext](Rendering.ScriptableRenderContext.html) and
`camera`. When used in conjunction with
[StopMultiEye](Rendering.ScriptableRenderContext.StopMultiEye.html), these
APIs provide fine-grained control of which draw calls are multi-plexed for
stereo purposes. For example, you would wrap your opaque and transparent
passes with
[StartMultiEye](Rendering.ScriptableRenderContext.StartMultiEye.html) and
[StopMultiEye](Rendering.ScriptableRenderContext.StopMultiEye.html), but you
could exclude your shadow rendering.  
  
Note that only draws are affected by this API. Compute work is not
automatically adjusted for stereo, therefore, per-eye compute work must be
manually generated.
