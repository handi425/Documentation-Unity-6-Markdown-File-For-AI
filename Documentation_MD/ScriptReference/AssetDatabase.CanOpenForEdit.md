## Declaration

public static void CanOpenForEdit(string[] assetOrMetaFilePaths, List<string>
outNotEditablePaths, [StatusQueryOptions](StatusQueryOptions.html)
statusQueryOptions = StatusQueryOptions.UseCachedIfPossible);

### Parameters

assetOrMetaFilePaths | Paths to Assets or their .meta files, relative to the project folder.  
---|---  
outNotEditablePaths | Destination list of non-editable Asset paths.  
statusQueryOptions | Specifies how Unity should query the version control system. The default value is [StatusQueryOptions.UseCachedIfPossible](StatusQueryOptions.UseCachedIfPossible.html).  
  
### Description

at once. It writes paths for Assets that are not 'available for edit' into the
`outNotEditablePaths` list.
