## Declaration

public static void
EndPaintHoles([TerrainTools.PaintContext](TerrainTools.PaintContext.html) ctx,
string editorUndoName);

### Parameters

ctx | The Terrain holes PaintContext to complete.  
---|---  
editorUndoName | Unique name used for the undo stack.  
  
### Description

Helper function to complete a Terrain holes modification.

Once the modified data is written to
[PaintContext.destinationRenderTexture](TerrainTools.PaintContext-
destinationRenderTexture.html), call this function to copy the modifications
back to the original Terrain tiles. This function also instructs Unity to
update the dirty regions of the Terrain holes data in each of the affected
Terrain tiles, so as to update collision and physics. This function will also
release all allocated resources in the PaintContext.  
  
See
[TerrainPaintUtility.BeginPaintHoles](TerrainTools.TerrainPaintUtility.BeginPaintHoles.html),
[PaintContext](TerrainTools.PaintContext.html), and
[PaintContext.ScatterHoles](TerrainTools.PaintContext.ScatterHoles.html).
