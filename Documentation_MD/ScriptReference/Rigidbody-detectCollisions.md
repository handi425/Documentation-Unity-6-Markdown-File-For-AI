[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-Rigidbody.html "Go to Rigidbody Component
in the Manual")

public bool detectCollisions;

### Description

Should collision detection be enabled? (By default always enabled).

Disabling collision detections is useful when you have a ragdoll which is
setup to be kinematic and you want to avoid heavy collision detection
calculations on that rigidbody. `detectCollisions` is not serialized. This
means it doesn't show up in the Inspector and when Instantiating the rigidbody
or saving it in a Scene, it will not be saved.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public [Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html) rb;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            rb = GetComponent<[Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html)>();
        }  
      
        // Let the rigidbody take control and detect collisions.
        void EnableRagdoll()
        {
            rb.isKinematic = false;
            rb.detectCollisions = true;
        }  
      
        // Let animation control the rigidbody and ignore collisions.
        void DisableRagdoll()
        {
            rb.isKinematic = true;
            rb.detectCollisions = false;
        }
    }
