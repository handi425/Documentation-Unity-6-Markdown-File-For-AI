## Declaration

public static PropertyModification[]
GetPropertyModifications([Object](Object.html) targetPrefab);

### Parameters

targetPrefab | Can be a Prefab instance in the scene or a Prefab instance in an Prefab Asset (e.g a Variant asset).  
---|---  
  
### Description

Returns all modifications that have been applied to a particular Prefab
instance in a Scene or modifications for a Prefab instance in an Asset.  
  
See [SetPropertyModifications](PrefabUtility.SetPropertyModifications.html)
for details about the fields of the returned
[PropertyModification](PropertyModification.html) objects.  
  
An alternative approach to getting property overrides information for a Prefab
instance is to use the
[GetObjectOverrides](PrefabUtility.GetObjectOverrides.html) API which also has
Apply and Revert functionality.  
  
When using GetPropertyModifications bear in mind that:

  * it will return both default and non-default overrides
  * It can return overrides for all child GameObjects and their Components
  * it can return overrides that are no longer valid.
