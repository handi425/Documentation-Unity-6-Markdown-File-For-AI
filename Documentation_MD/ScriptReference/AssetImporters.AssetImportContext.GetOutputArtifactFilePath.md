## Declaration

public string GetOutputArtifactFilePath(string fileName);

### Parameters

fileName | Unique identifier to refer to this Artifact File.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**string** The file path which can be used to create a new Artifact File.

### Description

Returns the path where to write a new Artifact File with the given fileName.

An Artifact File is part of the result of an importer and can contain any data
that are not UnityEngine.Object. For example the 'info' Artifact File is
reserved by Unity and stores the preview data of the imported Main Object.  
  
The following example shows how to add an Artifact File for a TextureImporter
AssetPostprocessor to save the color of the first pixel of the texture inside
an ArtifactFile. See
[AssetImportContext.GetArtifactFilePath](AssetImporters.AssetImportContext.GetArtifactFilePath.html)
to see how this information can be used by another importer to depends on this
value and not the whole texture.

    
    
    using [System](Rendering.VirtualTexturing.System.html);
    using System.IO;
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class SaveFirstPixelColor : [AssetPostprocessor](AssetPostprocessor.html)
    {
        public override uint GetVersion()
        {
            return 1;
        }  
      
        void OnPostprocessTexture([Texture2D](Texture2D.html) texture)
        {
            if (assetPath.StartsWith("Assets/"))
            {
                string path = context.GetOutputArtifactFilePath("firstpixelcolor");
                if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(path))
                    File.WriteAllText(path, $"#{[ColorUtility.ToHtmlStringRGBA](ColorUtility.ToHtmlStringRGBA.html)(texture.GetPixel(0, 0))}");
            }
        }
    }
