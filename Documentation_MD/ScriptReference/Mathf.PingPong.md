## Declaration

public static float PingPong(float t, float length);

### Description

PingPong returns a value that increments and decrements between zero and the
length. It follows the triangle wave formula where the bottom is set to zero
and the peak is set to `length`.

PingPong requires the value `t` to be a self-incrementing value. For example,
Time.time and Time.unscaledTime.  
  
The example below shows a simple use case with the light intensity going from
0 to 8 to 0 continuously.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class PingPongExample : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        [Light](Light.html) myLight;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            myLight = GetComponent<[Light](Light.html)>();
        }  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            myLight.intensity = [Mathf.PingPong](Mathf.PingPong.html)([Time.time](Time-time.html), 8);
        }
    }
    

The example below shows some outputs as example.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class OutputExample : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            // Prints 2
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)([Mathf.PingPong](Mathf.PingPong.html)(2, 5));  
      
            // Prints 3
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)([Mathf.PingPong](Mathf.PingPong.html)(7, 5));
     
            // Prints 1
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)([Mathf.PingPong](Mathf.PingPong.html)(11, 5));
        }
    }
