public [Material](Material.html) parent;

### Description

Parent of this material.

Materials with a non null parent are referred to as material variants.  
  
Material variants will inherit all their properties from their parent, and can
override them on a per property basis. Changing the value of a property of a
material will therefore impact all variants below in the hierarchy.  
  
This property is only available in the Editor, in a built project all material
hierarchies are flattened.
