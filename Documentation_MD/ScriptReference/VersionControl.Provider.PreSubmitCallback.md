## Declaration

public delegate bool
PreSubmitCallback([VersionControl.AssetList](VersionControl.AssetList.html)
list, ref string changesetID, ref string changesetDescription);

### Parameters

list | The list of Assets that will be passed on to the Checkout command. Assets can be removed from or added to this list in the callback.  
---|---  
changesetID | Set this to the ID of an existing changeset to submit the listed Assets in that changeset. If no changeset matching the specified ID is found, the submission will be blocked and an error message raised.  
changesetDescription | If you wish to submit the Assets out in a new changeset, set this description string and a new changeset will be created and the Assets submitted there.  
  
### Description

Delegate for a user-supplied callback to be called before Version Control
Submit.

A PreSubmitCallback may be set to enable the following: Permit the submission
by returning true from the callback. Prevent the submission by returning false
from the callback. Modify the list of Assets to be submitted (you may wish to
prevent certain Assets being submitted, or ensure that certain Assets are
submitted). Redirect the submission to an existing changeset. Create a new
changeset to submit the Assets out in.  
  
Notes: The AssetList is absolute - Assets and/or their Meta Files will not be
automatically added after this callback returns but may be filtered out if
they are not in the correct state to be submitted. You must not call any code
inside this callback that results in a further submit operation being created,
as this will lead to potentially infinite recursion. Setting both changesetID
and changesetDescription will cause the changeset description of an existing
changeset to be changed during submission. Please be aware of Domain Reloads.
If your Assemblies are reloaded at any point then
[Provider.preSubmitCallback](VersionControl.Provider-preSubmitCallback.html)
will need to be set again with your chosen callback.
