### Description

Option for how to apply a force using
[Rigidbody2D.AddForce](Rigidbody2D.AddForce.html).

Use this to apply a certain type of force to a 2D RigidBody. There are two
types of forces to apply: Force mode and Impulse Mode. For a 3D Rigidbody see
[ForceMode](ForceMode.html).

    
    
    //This script adds force to a [Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html). The kind of force is determined by which buttons you click.  
      
    //Create a [Sprite](Sprite.html) and attach a [Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) component to it
    //Attach this script to the [Sprite](Sprite.html)  
      
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.EventSystems;  
      
    public class AddingForce : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        //Use to switch between Force Modes
        enum ModeSwitching { Start, Impulse, Force };
        ModeSwitching m_ModeSwitching;  
      
        //Use this to change the different kinds of force
        [ForceMode2D](ForceMode2D.html) m_ForceMode;
        //Start position of the RigidBody, use to reset
        [Vector2](Vector2.html) m_StartPosition;  
      
        //Use to apply force to RigidBody
        [Vector2](Vector2.html) m_NewForce;  
      
        //Use to manipulate the RigidBody of a [GameObject](GameObject.html)
        [Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) m_Rigidbody;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            //Fetch the RigidBody component attached to the [GameObject](GameObject.html)
            m_Rigidbody = GetComponent<[Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html)>();
            //Start at first mode (nothing happening yet)
            m_ModeSwitching = ModeSwitching.Start;  
      
            //Initialising the force to use on the RigidBody in various ways
            m_NewForce = new [Vector2](Vector2.html)(-5.0f, 1.0f);

                case ModeSwitching.Start:  
      
                    //Reset to starting position of RigidBody
                    m_Rigidbody.transform.position = m_StartPosition;
                    //Reset the velocity of the RigidBody
                    m_Rigidbody.velocity = new [Vector2](Vector2.html)(0f, 0f);
