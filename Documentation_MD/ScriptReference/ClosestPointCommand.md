### Description

Struct used to set up a closest point command to be performed asynchronously
during a job.  
  
When you use this struct to schedule a batch of closest commands, they are
performed asynchronously and in parallel to each other. The results of the
closest points are written to the results buffer. Because the results are
written asynchronously, the results buffer cannot be accessed until the job
has been completed.  
  
The result for a command at index N in the command buffer is stored at index N
in the results buffer.
