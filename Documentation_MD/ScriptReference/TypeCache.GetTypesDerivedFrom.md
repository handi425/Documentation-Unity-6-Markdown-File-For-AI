## Declaration

public static [TypeCache.TypeCollection](TypeCache.TypeCollection.html)
GetTypesDerivedFrom();

## Declaration

public static [TypeCache.TypeCollection](TypeCache.TypeCollection.html)
GetTypesDerivedFrom(Type parentType);

## Declaration

public static [TypeCache.TypeCollection](TypeCache.TypeCollection.html)
GetTypesDerivedFrom(string assemblyName);

## Declaration

public static [TypeCache.TypeCollection](TypeCache.TypeCollection.html)
GetTypesDerivedFrom(Type parentType, string assemblyName);

### Parameters

parentType | Type of a class or interface.  
---|---  
assemblyName | Optional assembly name.  
  
### Returns

**TypeCollection** Returns an unordered collection of derived types. If
assemblyName is specified, returns only types defined in this assembly.

### Description

Retrieves an unordered collection of types derived from the **T** type.

This method provides fast access to all classes loaded from a given assembly
or all Unity domain assemblies, which are derived from a specific class or
implement a specific interface. Base class or interface can be a generic. The
order of results is undefined.

    
    
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);  
      
    public class Example
    {
        static void ScanAssetPostprocessors()
        {
            var extractedTypes = [TypeCache.GetTypesDerivedFrom](TypeCache.GetTypesDerivedFrom.html)<[AssetPostprocessor](AssetPostprocessor.html)>();
            foreach (var editors in extractedTypes)
            {
                //...
            }
        }
    }
    

Or classes which implement a specific interface.

    
    
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);  
      
    public interface IExampleInterface {}  
      
    public class Example
    {
        static void ScanInterfaceImplementers()
        {
            var extractedTypes = [TypeCache.GetTypesDerivedFrom](TypeCache.GetTypesDerivedFrom.html)<IExampleInterface>();
            foreach (var editors in extractedTypes)
            {
                //...
            }
        }
    }
    

**Note:** The returned [TypeCollection](TypeCache.TypeCollection.html) is
read-only and thread-safe. The order of types in the collection is undefined.
