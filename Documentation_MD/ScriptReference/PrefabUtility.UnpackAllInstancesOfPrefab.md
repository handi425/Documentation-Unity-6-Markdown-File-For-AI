## Declaration

public static void UnpackAllInstancesOfPrefab([GameObject](GameObject.html)
prefabRoot, [PrefabUnpackMode](PrefabUnpackMode.html) unpackMode,
[InteractionMode](InteractionMode.html) action);

### Parameters

prefabRoot | The root GameObject of a Prefab Asset used to find all Prefab instances in open scenes that should be unpacked.  
---|---  
unpackMode | Whether to unpack the outermost root or unpack completely.  
action | The interaction mode to use for this action.  
  
### Description

Unpacks all instances of a given Prefab Asset root GameObject in all open
scenes so that all instances are replaced with the contents of the Prefab
Asset while retaining all override values.

The Prefab instances will not be unpacked in closed scenes. This function uses
[PrefabUtility.FindAllInstancesOfPrefab](PrefabUtility.FindAllInstancesOfPrefab.html)
to determine which instances to unpack and calls
[PrefabUtility.UnpackPrefabInstance](PrefabUtility.UnpackPrefabInstance.html)
for each instance.  
  
Unpacking throws an ArgumentException if the given object is not the root
GameObject of a Prefab Asset.

    
    
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example
    {
        public static void UnpackAllInstancesOfPrefab(string prefabPath)
        {
            var prefabAssetRoot = [AssetDatabase.LoadMainAssetAtPath](AssetDatabase.LoadMainAssetAtPath.html)(prefabPath) as [GameObject](GameObject.html);
            if (prefabAssetRoot != null)
            {
                [PrefabUtility.UnpackAllInstancesOfPrefab](PrefabUtility.UnpackAllInstancesOfPrefab.html)(prefabAssetRoot, [PrefabUnpackMode.OutermostRoot](PrefabUnpackMode.OutermostRoot.html), [InteractionMode.UserAction](InteractionMode.UserAction.html));
            }
        }
    }
