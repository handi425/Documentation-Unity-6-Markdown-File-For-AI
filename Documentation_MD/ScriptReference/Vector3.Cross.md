public static [Vector3](Vector3.html) Cross([Vector3](Vector3.html) lhs,
[Vector3](Vector3.html) rhs);

### Description

Cross Product of two vectors.

The cross product of two vectors results in a third vector which is
perpendicular to the two input vectors. The result's magnitude is equal to the
magnitudes of the two inputs multiplied together and then multiplied by the
sine of the angle between the inputs. You can determine the direction of the
result vector using the "left hand rule".

_The left hand rule applied to Cross(a, b)._

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        // Get the normal to a triangle from the three corner points a, b, and o, where o is the origin point of vectors a and b.
        [Vector3](Vector3.html) GetNormal([Vector3](Vector3.html) a, [Vector3](Vector3.html) b, [Vector3](Vector3.html) o)
        {
            // Find vectors corresponding to two of the sides of the triangle.
            [Vector3](Vector3.html) side1 = a - o;
            [Vector3](Vector3.html) side2 = b - o;  
      
            // Cross the vectors to get a perpendicular vector, then normalize it. This is the [Result](Networking.UnityWebRequest.Result.html) vector in the drawing above.
            return [Vector3.Cross](Vector3.Cross.html)(side1, side2).normalized;
        }
    }
