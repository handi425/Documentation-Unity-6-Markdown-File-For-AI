**Obsolete** GetTotalUnusedReservedMemory has been deprecated since it is
limited to 4GB. Please use GetTotalUnusedReservedMemoryLong() instead.

## Declaration

public static uint GetTotalUnusedReservedMemory();

### Description

Returns the amount of reserved but not used system memory.

Unity assumes that the game will use more memory. The value of
[GetTotalUnusedReservedMemory](Profiling.Profiler.GetTotalUnusedReservedMemory.html)
reports the total amount of memory currently available.

Additional resources:
[GetTotalAllocatedMemory](Profiling.Profiler.GetTotalAllocatedMemory.html),
[GetTotalReservedMemory](Profiling.Profiler.GetTotalReservedMemory.html).
