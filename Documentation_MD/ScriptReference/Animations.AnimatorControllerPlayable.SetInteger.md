## Declaration

public void SetInteger(string name, int value);

## Declaration

public void SetInteger(int id, int value);

### Parameters

name | The parameter name.  
---|---  
id | The parameter ID.  
value | The new parameter value.  
  
### Description

Sets the value of the given integer parameter.

Use this as a way to trigger transitions between Animator states. One way of
using Integers instead of Floats or Booleans is to use it for something that
has multiple states, for example directions (turn left, turn right etc.). Each
direction could correspond to a number instead of having multiple Booleans
that have to be reset each time.  
  
See documentation on [Animation](../Manual/Animator.html) for more information
on setting up Animators.  
  
Note: You can identify the parameter by name or by ID number, but the name or
ID number must be the same as the parameter you want to change in the
AnimatorController.
