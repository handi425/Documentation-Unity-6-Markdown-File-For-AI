### Parameters

hit | The RaycastHit2D to being checked for valid results.  
---|---  
  
### Description

Implicit operator used to return a `true` or `false` result indicating if the
result is valid or not.

When using any physics query that returns a RaycastHit2D, you should always
first check to see if it contains a valid result which indicates a hit
(intersection) was detected. You can do this by checking if the RaycastHit2D
is `true` or `false`.  
  
**NOTE:** A valid result is indicated by the field
[RaycastHit2D.Collider](RaycastHit2D.Collider.html) referring to a valid
[Collider2D](Collider2D.html) i.e. not being NULL. This operator is therefore
equivalent to checking if that field is NULL ( `false` ) or not NULL ( `true`
).

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public [Vector2](Vector2.html) direction;  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            // Cast a ray in the direction specified in the inspector.
            [RaycastHit2D](RaycastHit2D.html) hit = [Physics2D.Raycast](Physics2D.Raycast.html)(transform.position, direction);  
      
            // If something was hit, draw a line from the start position to the point we intersected.
            if (hit)
                [Debug.DrawLine](Debug.DrawLine.html)(transform.position, hit.point, [Color.yellow](Color-yellow.html));
        }
    }
