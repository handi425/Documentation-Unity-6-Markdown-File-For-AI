### Parameters

positions | The array of positions to set.  
---|---  
  
### Description

Sets the positions of all vertices in the trail.

You can only use this method to modify existing positions in the Trail. You
cannot use it to add new positions.  
  
When setting all positions, use this method instead of
[SetPosition](TrailRenderer.SetPosition.html) because it is more efficient to
set all positions using a single command than to set each position
individually.  
  
Additional resources: [positionCount](TrailRenderer-positionCount.html)
property.  
  
Additional resources: [SetPosition](TrailRenderer.SetPosition.html) function.
