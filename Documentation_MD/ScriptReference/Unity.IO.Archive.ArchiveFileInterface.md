### Description

Provides methods for managing Unity archive files.

This class offers a low level interface for managing Unity Archive Files.  
  
Once an Archive is mounted its contents can be accessed with
[AsyncReadManager](Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.AsyncReadManager.html) or
[ContentLoadInterface.LoadContentFileAsync](Unity.Loading.ContentLoadInterface.LoadContentFileAsync.html).  
  
AssetBundles are an example of an Archive file and can be loaded with this
API. However, typically AssetBundles are loading using the
[AssetBundle](AssetBundle.html) class, or via the Addressables package.  
  
Another example of an Archive file is the `data.unity3d` file generated when
[BuildPipeline.BuildPlayer](BuildPipeline.BuildPlayer.html) is called with
[BuildOptions.CompressWithLz4](BuildOptions.CompressWithLz4.html) or
[BuildOptions.CompressWithLz4HC](BuildOptions.CompressWithLz4HC.html). In that
case this API is not normally needed, because the contents of the Archive are
automatically available in the player.  
  
Additional resources:
[ContentBuildInterface.ArchiveAndCompress](Build.Content.ContentBuildInterface.ArchiveAndCompress.html).

### Static Methods

[GetMountedArchives](Unity.IO.Archive.ArchiveFileInterface.GetMountedArchives.html)|
Retrieves all mounted archives.  
---|---  
[MountAsync](Unity.IO.Archive.ArchiveFileInterface.MountAsync.html)| Loads all
files in an archive to a mount point.
