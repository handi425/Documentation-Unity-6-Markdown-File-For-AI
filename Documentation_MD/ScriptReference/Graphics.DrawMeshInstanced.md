## Declaration

### Parameters

mesh | The [Mesh](Mesh.html) to draw.  
---|---  
submeshIndex | Which subset of the mesh to draw. This applies only to meshes that are composed of several materials.  
material |  [Material](Material.html) to use.  
matrices | The array of object transformation matrices.  
count | The number of instances to be drawn.  
properties | Additional material properties to apply. See [MaterialPropertyBlock](MaterialPropertyBlock.html).  
castShadows | Determines whether the Meshes should cast shadows.  
receiveShadows | Determines whether the Meshes should receive shadows.  
layer |  [Layer](../Manual/Layers.html) to use.  
camera | If `null` (default), the mesh will be drawn in all cameras. Otherwise it will be drawn in the given Camera only.  
lightProbeUsage |  [LightProbeUsage](Rendering.LightProbeUsage.html) for the instances.  
  
### Description

Draws the same mesh multiple times using GPU instancing.

Similar to [Graphics.DrawMesh](Graphics.DrawMesh.html), this function draws
meshes for one frame without the overhead of creating unnecessary game
objects. This function is now obsolete. Use
[Graphics.RenderMeshInstanced](Graphics.RenderMeshInstanced.html) instead. Use
this function in situations where you want to draw the same mesh for a
particular amount of times using an instanced shader. Unity culls and sorts
instanced Meshes as a group. It creates an axis-aligned bounding box that
contains all the Meshes, calculates the center point, then uses this
information to cull and sort the Mesh instances. Note that after culling and
sorting the combined instances, Unity does not further cull individual
instances by the view frustum or baked occluders. It also does not sort
individual instances for transparency or depth efficiency.  
  
The transformation matrix of each instance of the mesh should be packed into
the `matrices` array. You can specify the number of instances to draw, or by
default it is the length of the `matrices` array. Other per-instance data, if
required by the shader, should be provided by creating arrays on the
MaterialPropertyBlock argument using
[SetFloatArray](MaterialPropertyBlock.SetFloatArray.html),
[SetVectorArray](MaterialPropertyBlock.SetVectorArray.html) and
[SetMatrixArray](MaterialPropertyBlock.SetMatrixArray.html).  
  
To render the instances with light probes, provide the light probe data via
the MaterialPropertyBlock and specify `lightProbeUsage` with
[LightProbeUsage.CustomProvided](Rendering.LightProbeUsage.CustomProvided.html).
Check
[LightProbes.CalculateInterpolatedLightAndOcclusionProbes](LightProbes.CalculateInterpolatedLightAndOcclusionProbes.html)
for the details.  
  
Note: You can only draw a maximum of 1023 instances at once.  
  
InvalidOperationException will be thrown if the material doesn't have
[Material.enableInstancing](Material-enableInstancing.html) set to true, or
the current platform doesn't support this API (i.e. if GPU instancing is not
available). See [SystemInfo.supportsInstancing](SystemInfo-
supportsInstancing.html).
