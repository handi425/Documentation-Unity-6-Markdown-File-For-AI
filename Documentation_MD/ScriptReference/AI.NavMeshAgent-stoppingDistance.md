public float stoppingDistance;

### Description

Stop within this distance from the target position.

It is seldom possible to land _exactly_ at the target point, so this property
can be used to set an acceptable radius within which the agent should stop. A
larger stopping distance will give the agent more room for manoeuvre at the
end of the path and might avoid sudden braking, turning or other unconvincing
AI behaviour.
