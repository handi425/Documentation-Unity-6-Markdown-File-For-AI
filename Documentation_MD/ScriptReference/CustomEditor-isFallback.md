public bool isFallback;

### Description

If true, match this editor only if all non-fallback editors do not match.
Defaults to false.

Unity does a two-pass match to hook up editors with inspected types. First the
non-fallback editors are tested, and if none match, then the fallbacks are
tested for a match. Setting this flag lets you set up a default editor for a
given type, while still permitting another editor type to override it.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
