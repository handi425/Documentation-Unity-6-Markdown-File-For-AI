## Declaration

public string ToString();

### Description

Convert a Hash128 to string.

This creates a string that is 32 characters long. Each of the 16 hash bytes is
represented as two hexadecimal characters.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class ExampleScript : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            var hash = new [Hash128](Hash128.html)(0x01020304, 0xaabbccdd, 0x12345678, 0xbaadc0de);
            // prints "04030201ddccbbaa78563412dec0adba",
            // because the hash values are in little-endian byte order
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)(hash.ToString());
        }
    }
