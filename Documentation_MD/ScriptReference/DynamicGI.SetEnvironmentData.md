## Declaration

public static void SetEnvironmentData(float[] input);

### Parameters

input | Array of float values to be used for Enlighten Realtime Global Illumination environment lighting.  
---|---  
  
### Description

Allows overriding the distant environment lighting for Enlighten Realtime
Global Illumination, without changing the Skybox Material.

The input array represents a cube with each face being 8 x 8 texels and each
texel being 4 floats (for the RGBA values of the texel's color), so the size
of the array is 8*8*6*4 = 1536 floats.  
Note that changing the Distant Environment Lighting Source or Environment
Lighting Intensity will overwrite the data set with this function.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class ExampleScript : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            // Set custom environment data for Enlighten Realtime Global Illumination.
            const int kCubeSize = 8 * 8;
            const int kEnvironmentDataSize = kCubeSize * 6 * 4;
            float[] envData = new float[kEnvironmentDataSize];  
      
            for (int c = 0; c < 6; ++c) // cube has 6 sides.
            {
                for (int i = 0; i < kCubeSize; i += 4)
                {
                    int index = c * kCubeSize;  
      
                    // Fill with default values.
                    envData[index + i + 0] = 0.0f;
                    envData[index + i + 1] = 0.0f;
                    envData[index + i + 2] = 0.0f;
                    envData[index + i + 3] = 1.0f;  
      
                    // Funky colors on each cube face.
                    envData[index + i + (c / 2)] = 4.0f * (float)i / (float)kCubeSize;
                }
            }  
      
            // Send the generated environment data to the GI system.
            [DynamicGI.SetEnvironmentData](DynamicGI.SetEnvironmentData.html)(envData);
        }
    }
