Component in the Manual")

public float spatialBlend;

### Description

Sets how much this AudioSource is affected by 3D spatialisation calculations
(attenuation, doppler etc). 0.0 makes the sound full 2D, 1.0 makes it full 3D.

Aside from determining if this AudioSource is heard as a 2D or 3D source, this
property is useful to morph between the two modes.  
  
3D spatial calculations are applied after stereo panning is determined and can
be used in conjunction with panStereo.  
  
Morphing between the 2 modes is useful for sounds that should be progressively
heard as normal 2D sounds the closer they are to the listener.
