static bool depthBufferSharingEnabled;

### Description

Toggle support for sharing the depth buffer between Unity and the OS. This
allows for stability improvements when running in Windows Mixed Reality. For
immersive headsets this allows the operating system to reproject the rendered
scene when there is a loss of accuracy in tracking. For Holographic headsets
this allows for the operating system to automatically set a focus point along
the plane that intersects the most content in your scene.
