### Description

A mesh collider allows you to do [collision detection](../Manual/class-
MeshCollider.html) between meshes and primitives.

### Static Methods

[Destroy](Object.Destroy.html)| Removes a GameObject, component or asset.  
---|---  
[DestroyImmediate](Object.DestroyImmediate.html)| Destroys the object obj
immediately. You are strongly recommended to use Destroy instead.

Object when loading a new Scene.  
[FindAnyObjectByType](Object.FindAnyObjectByType.html)| Retrieves any active
loaded object of Type type.  
[FindFirstObjectByType](Object.FindFirstObjectByType.html)| Retrieves the

### Messages

[OnCollisionEnter](Collider.OnCollisionEnter.html)| OnCollisionEnter is called
when this collider/rigidbody has begun touching another rigidbody/collider.  
---|---  
[OnCollisionExit](Collider.OnCollisionExit.html)| OnCollisionExit is called
when this collider/rigidbody has stopped touching another rigidbody/collider.  
[OnCollisionStay](Collider.OnCollisionStay.html)| OnCollisionStay is called
once per frame for every Collider or Rigidbody that touches another Collider
or Rigidbody.  
[OnTriggerEnter](Collider.OnTriggerEnter.html)| Called when a Collider with
the Collider.isTrigger property overlaps another Collider.  
[OnTriggerExit](Collider.OnTriggerExit.html)| OnTriggerExit is called when the
Collider other has stopped touching the trigger.  
[OnTriggerStay](Collider.OnTriggerStay.html)| OnTriggerStay is called almost
all the frames for every Collider other that is touching the trigger. The
function is on the physics timer so it won't necessarily run every frame.
