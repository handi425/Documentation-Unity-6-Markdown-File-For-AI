### Description

This struct acts like a handle for accessing a file loaded by
[ContentLoadInterface.LoadContentFileAsync](Unity.Loading.ContentLoadInterface.LoadContentFileAsync.html).
You can use it to access the status and results of the load operation.

### Static Properties

[GlobalTableDependency](Unity.Loading.ContentFile.GlobalTableDependency.html)|
This ContentFile can be passed as a dependency to
ContentLoadInterface.LoadContentFileAsync or
ContentLoadInterface.LoadSceneAsync to indicate that the external file
dependencies should be resolved through the global PersistentManager table.
For example, this could be used when the ContentFile references a file loaded
through the PersistentManager such as "unity default resources".  
---|---  
  
### Properties

[IsValid](Unity.Loading.ContentFile.IsValid.html)| Returns true if the
ContentFile handle is valid.  
---|---  
[LoadingStatus](Unity.Loading.ContentFile.LoadingStatus.html)| The loading
status of the ContentFile.  
  
### Public Methods

[GetObject](Unity.Loading.ContentFile.GetObject.html)| Used to access objects
within the ContentFile by local file identifier.  
---|---  
[GetObjects](Unity.Loading.ContentFile.GetObjects.html)| This function can be
used to access all the Objects loaded in the ContentFile.  
[UnloadAsync](Unity.Loading.ContentFile.UnloadAsync.html)| Begin an
asynchronous unload of the ContentFile.  
[WaitForCompletion](Unity.Loading.ContentFile.WaitForCompletion.html)| Blocks
on the main thread until the load operation completes. This function can be
slow and so should be used carefully to avoid frame rate stuttering.
