public static string persistentDataPath;

### Description

Contains the path to a persistent data directory (Read-only).

This value is a directory path where you can store data that you want to
retain between runs. When you publish on iOS and Android, `persistentDataPath`
points to a public directory on the device. The files can only be erased by
users directly and not by any app updates. **Note:** The difference slashes
indicate the different operating systems according to
Path.DirectorySeparatorChar.  
  
When you build the Unity application, a GUID is generated that is based on the
Bundle Identifier. This GUID is part of `persistentDataPath`. If you keep the
same Bundle Identifier in future versions, the application keeps accessing the
same location on every update.  
  
**UWP Apps** : [Application.persistentDataPath](Application-
persistentDataPath.html) points to `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\LocalLow\<company
name>`.  
  
**Windows Editor and Windows Player** :
[Application.persistentDataPath](Application-persistentDataPath.html) usually
points to `%userprofile%\AppData\LocalLow\<companyname>\<productname>`. It is
resolved by [SHGetKnownFolderPath](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-
us/windows/win32/api/shlobj_core/nf-shlobj_core-shgetknownfolderpath) with
FOLDERID_LocalAppDataLow, or [SHGetFolderPathW](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-
us/windows/win32/api/shlobj_core/nf-shlobj_core-shgetfolderpathw) with
CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA if the former is not available.  
  
**WebGL** : [Application.persistentDataPath](Application-
persistentDataPath.html) points to `/idbfs/<md5 hash of data path>` where the
data path is the URL stripped of everything including and after the last '/'
before any '?' components.  
  
**Linux** : [Application.persistentDataPath](Application-
persistentDataPath.html) points to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/unity3d` or
`$HOME/.config/unity3d`.  
  
**iOS** : [Application.persistentDataPath](Application-
persistentDataPath.html) points to
`/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/<guid>/Documents`.  
  
**tvOS** : [Application.persistentDataPath](Application-
persistentDataPath.html) is not supported and returns an empty string.  
  
**Android** : [Application.persistentDataPath](Application-
persistentDataPath.html) points to
`/storage/emulated/<userid>/Android/data/<packagename>/files` on most devices
(some older phones might point to location on SD card if present), the path is
resolved using
[android.content.Context.getExternalFilesDir](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context#getExternalFilesDir\(java.lang.String\)).  
  
**Mac** : [Application.persistentDataPath](Application-
persistentDataPath.html) points to the user Library folder (This folder is
often hidden). In recent Unity releases, user data is written into
`~/Library/Application Support/company name/product name`. Older versions of
Unity wrote into the `~/Library/Caches` folder, or `~/Library/Application
Support/unity.company name.product name`. These folders are all searched for
by Unity. The application finds and uses the oldest folder with the required
data on your system.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Info : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)([Application.persistentDataPath](Application-persistentDataPath.html));
        }
    }
