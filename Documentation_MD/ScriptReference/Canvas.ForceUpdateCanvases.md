## Declaration

public static void ForceUpdateCanvases();

### Description

Force all canvases to update their content.

A canvas performs its layout and content generation calculations at the end of
a frame, just before rendering, in order to ensure that it's based on all the
latest changes that may have happened during that frame. This means that in
the Start callback and the first Update callback, the layout and content under
the canvas may not be up-to-date.  
  
Code that relies on up-to-date layout or content can call this method to
ensure it before executing code that relies on it.
