## Declaration

public static
[Unity.Android.Gradle.Manifest.Action](Unity.Android.Gradle.Manifest.Action.html)
GetOrCreateChannel(string channelName, Action<int,byte[]> handler);

### Parameters

channelName | The name of the channel to retrieve.  
---|---  
handler | The channel handler to register.  
  
### Returns

**Action** This action can be invoked to unregister the handler from the
channel (see
[ChannelService.UnregisterMessageHandler](MPE.ChannelService.UnregisterMessageHandler.html)).

### Description

Gets or creates a new channel.

When you create a channel, the ChannelService listens to connections on it,
and routes all messages sent to it. You have to register a handler to process
the messages and send them back to other clients."  
  
If a channel with the same name already exists, it appends the handler to its
list of handlers. This allows you to log or listen to all messages sent to a
specific channel.
