## Declaration

public static void CalculateBuildUsageTags(ObjectIdentifier[] objectIDs,
ObjectIdentifier[] dependentObjectIDs,
[Build.Content.BuildUsageTagGlobal](Build.Content.BuildUsageTagGlobal.html)
globalUsage,
[Build.Content.BuildUsageTagSet](Build.Content.BuildUsageTagSet.html)
usageSet);

## Declaration

public static void CalculateBuildUsageTags(ObjectIdentifier[] objectIDs,
ObjectIdentifier[] dependentObjectIDs,
[Build.Content.BuildUsageTagGlobal](Build.Content.BuildUsageTagGlobal.html)
globalUsage,
[Build.Content.BuildUsageTagSet](Build.Content.BuildUsageTagSet.html)
usageSet, [Build.Content.BuildUsageCache](Build.Content.BuildUsageCache.html)
usageCache);

### Parameters

objectIDs | Objects that will have their build usage calculated.  
---|---  
dependentObjectIDs | Objects that reference the Objects being calculated.  
globalUsage | Lighting information used by the build.  
usageSet | The BuildUsageTagSet where the calculated usage information will be stored.  
usageCache | Optional cache object to use for improving performance with multiple calls to this api.  
  
### Description

Calculates the build usage of a set of objects.

Internal use only. See note on
[ContentBuildInterface](Build.Content.ContentBuildInterface.html).  
  
To calculate how any given Object is being used in a build, we need two pieces
of information. First, we need to know that Object's dependents, or in other
words, what references that Object. For example, for a Shader, we would need
to know the list Materials that reference that shader. Second, we need the
combined lighting information for Scenes where the Object can be used. Using
these two pieces of information, we calculate the correct usage information
for an Object, and then store that information in the
[BuildUsageTagSet](Build.Content.BuildUsageTagSet.html).
