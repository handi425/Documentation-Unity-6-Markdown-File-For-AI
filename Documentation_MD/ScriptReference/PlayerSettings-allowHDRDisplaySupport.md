[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-PlayerSettings.html "Go to PlayerSettings
Component in the Manual")

public static bool allowHDRDisplaySupport;

### Description

Prepare the application to encode images for an HDR display.

When you enable `allowHDRDisplaySupport`, the application build includes all
the resources, such as shaders, that are required to correctly encode the
final output for an HDR display.  
  
Disabling this setting also disables
[PlayerSettings.useHDRDisplay](PlayerSettings-useHDRDisplay.html) because you
cannot use a display in HDR mode without the required resources.  
  
Enable this setting without enabling
[PlayerSettings.useHDRDisplay](PlayerSettings-useHDRDisplay.html) if you don't
want to use the main display in HDR mode, but do want to use an XR Display in
HDR mode.  
  
Additional resources: [PlayerSettings.useHDRDisplay](PlayerSettings-
useHDRDisplay.html).
