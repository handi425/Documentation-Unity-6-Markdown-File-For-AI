Manual")

**Obsolete** Please use Resources.FindObjectsOfTypeAll instead.

## Declaration

public static Object[] FindObjectsOfTypeAll(Type type);

### Parameters

type | The type of object to find.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**Object[]** The array of objects found matching the type specified.

### Description

Returns a list of all active and inactive loaded objects of Type `type`.

It will return no assets (meshes, textures, prefabs, etc.).  
  
Be aware that when running in the editor, this function will also return
hidden objects used by Unity itself such as the Scene view camera and preview
camera.  
  
Please note that this function is very slow. It is not recommended to use this
function every frame. In most cases you can use the singleton pattern instead.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
**Known Issue**. Please check with the Issue Tracker at
