## Declaration

public static CoveredSequencePoint[] GetSequencePointsFor(MethodBase method);

### Parameters

method | The method to get the sequence points for.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**CoveredSequencePoint[]** Array of sequence points.

### Description

Returns the coverage sequence points for the method you specify. See
[CoveredSequencePoint](TestTools.CoveredSequencePoint.html) for more
information about the coverage data this method returns.

        // the method will have complete coverage. If incrementValue
        // is false, the coverage will be incomplete.
