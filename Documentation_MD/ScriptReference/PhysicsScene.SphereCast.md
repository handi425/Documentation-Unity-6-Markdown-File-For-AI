## Declaration

public bool SphereCast([Vector3](Vector3.html) origin, float radius,
[Vector3](Vector3.html) direction, out [RaycastHit](RaycastHit.html) hitInfo,
float maxDistance = Mathf.Infinity, int layerMask = DefaultRaycastLayers,
[QueryTriggerInteraction](QueryTriggerInteraction.html)
queryTriggerInteraction = QueryTriggerInteraction.UseGlobal);

### Parameters

origin | The center of the sphere at the start of the sweep.  
---|---  
radius | The radius of the sphere.  
direction | The direction into which to sweep the sphere.  
hitInfo | If true is returned, `hitInfo` will contain more information about where the collider was hit. (Additional resources: [RaycastHit](RaycastHit.html)).  
maxDistance | The max length of the cast.  
layerMask | A [Layer mask](../Manual/Layers.html) that is used to selectively ignore colliders when casting a capsule.  
queryTriggerInteraction | Specifies whether this query should hit Triggers.  
  
### Returns

**bool** True when the sphere sweep intersects any collider, otherwise false.

### Description

Casts a sphere along a ray and returns detailed information on what was hit.

### Returns

**int** The amount of hits stored into the `results` buffer.

### Description

Cast sphere along the direction and store the results into buffer.
