public float distance;

### Description

The distance from the ray's origin to the impact point.

In the case of a ray, the distance represents the magnitude of the vector from
the ray's origin to the impact point.  
  
In the case of a swept volume or sphere cast, the distance represents the
magnitude of the vector from the origin point to the translated point at which
the volume contacts the other collider.  
  
Note that [RaycastHit.point](RaycastHit-point.html) represents the point in
space where the collision occurs.

        // raycast then applying a force that decreases as the object
        // reaches the desired levitation height.  
      
        // Vary the parameters below to
        // get different control effects. For example, reducing the
        // hover damping will tend to make the object bounce if it
        // passes over an object underneath.
