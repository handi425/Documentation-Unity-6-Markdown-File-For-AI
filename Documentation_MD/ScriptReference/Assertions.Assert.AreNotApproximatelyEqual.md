## Declaration

public static void AreNotApproximatelyEqual(float expected, float actual);

## Declaration

public static void AreNotApproximatelyEqual(float expected, float actual,
string message);

## Declaration

public static void AreNotApproximatelyEqual(float expected, float actual,
float tolerance);

## Declaration

public static void AreNotApproximatelyEqual(float expected, float actual,
float tolerance, string message);

### Parameters

tolerance | Tolerance of approximation.  
---|---  
expected | The assumed [Assert](Assertions.Assert.html) value.  
actual | The exact [Assert](Assertions.Assert.html) value.  
message | The string used to describe the [Assert](Assertions.Assert.html).  
  
### Description

Asserts that the values are approximately not equal.

An absolute error check is used for approximate equality check (|a-b| <
tolerance). Default tolerance is 0.00001f.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.Assertions;  
      
    public class AssertionExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        [Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html) rb;  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            // Make sure the rigidbody never stops.
            // AreNotApproximatelyEqual should be used for comparing floating point variables.
            // Unless specified, default error tolerance will be used.
            [Assert.AreNotApproximatelyEqual](Assertions.Assert.AreNotApproximatelyEqual.html)(0.0f, rb.velocity.magnitude);
        }
    }
