## Declaration

public static Object
GlobalObjectIdentifierToObjectSlow([GlobalObjectId](GlobalObjectId.html) id);

### Parameters

id | The `GlobalObjectId` to lookup.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**Object** Returns a reference to the object. Returns `null` if the
`GlobalObjectId` can't be found, or if the object is inside a scene and the
scene isn't loaded.

### Description

Obtains a reference to an object from its unique object identifier.

This method is slow. Use it sparingly. If you use this method in a large
project within other performance-sensitive contexts such as
[ISerializationCallbackReceiver.OnBeforeSerialize](ISerializationCallbackReceiver.OnBeforeSerialize.html)
or
[ISerializationCallbackReceiver.OnAfterDeserialize](ISerializationCallbackReceiver.OnAfterDeserialize.html),
it's strongly recommended to profile the performance impact.
