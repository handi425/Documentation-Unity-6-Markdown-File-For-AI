## Declaration

public RenderTexture([RenderTexture](RenderTexture.html) textureToCopy);

## Declaration

public RenderTexture([RenderTextureDescriptor](RenderTextureDescriptor.html)
desc);

## Declaration

public RenderTexture(int width, int height, int depth,
[RenderTextureFormat](RenderTextureFormat.html) format =
RenderTextureFormat.Default,
[RenderTextureReadWrite](RenderTextureReadWrite.html) readWrite =
RenderTextureReadWrite.Default);

### Parameters

width | Texture width in pixels.  
---|---  
height | Texture height in pixels.  
depth | Number of bits in depth buffer (0, 16, 24 or 32). Note that only 24 and 32 bit depth have stencil buffer support.  
format | Texture color format.  
colorFormat | The color format for the RenderTexture.  
depthStencilFormat | The depth stencil format for the RenderTexture.  
mipCount | Amount of mips to allocate for the RenderTexture.  
readWrite | How color space conversions are applied on texture read/write.  
desc | Create the RenderTexture with the settings in the RenderTextureDescriptor.  
textureToCopy | Copy the settings from another RenderTexture.  
  
### Description

Creates a new RenderTexture object.

The render texture is created with `width` by `height` size, with a depth
buffer of `depth` bits (depth can be 0, 16, 24 or 32), and in `format` format
and with sRGB read / write on or off.  
  
Note that constructing a RenderTexture object does not create the hardware
representation immediately. The actual render texture is created upon first
use or when [Create](RenderTexture.Create.html) is called manually. So after
constructing the render texture, it is possible to set additional variables,
like [format](RenderTexture-graphicsFormat.html), [dimension](RenderTexture-
dimension.html) and so on.  
  
Also note that your graphics device capabilities determine the maximum size of
a RenderTexture. To determine the maximum size, use
[SystemInfo.maxTextureSize](SystemInfo-maxTextureSize.html) for 2D and cubemap
RenderTextures, [SystemInfo.maxTexture3DSize](SystemInfo-
maxTexture3DSize.html) for 3D RenderTextures, and
[SystemInfo.maxTextureSize](SystemInfo-maxTextureSize.html) and
[SystemInfo.maxTextureArraySlices](SystemInfo-maxTextureArraySlices.html) for
2D array RenderTextures.  
  
When the requested size exceeds the maximum size, Unity's behavior varies. If
the RenderTexture is not a 3D texture, and the requested size is a power of
two, Unity automatically scales down the requested size by a factor of 2 until
it is below the maximum, and then creates the RenderTexture at that size.
Otherwise, Unity fails to create the RenderTexture, and throws an error.

    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public [RenderTexture](RenderTexture.html) rt;  
      
        void  Start()
        {
            rt = new [RenderTexture](RenderTexture.html)(256, 256, 16, [RenderTextureFormat.ARGB32](RenderTextureFormat.ARGB32.html));
        }
    }
