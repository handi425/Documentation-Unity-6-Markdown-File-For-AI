### Parameters

url | The target URL with which this UnityWebRequest will communicate. Also accessible via the [url](Networking.UnityWebRequest-url.html) property.  
---|---  
uri | The target URI to which form data will be transmitted.  
method | HTTP GET, POST, etc. methods.  
downloadHandler | Replies from the server.

### Description

Creates a UnityWebRequest with the default options and no attached
[DownloadHandler](Networking.DownloadHandler.html) or
[UploadHandler](Networking.UploadHandler.html). Default method is `GET`.

The raw constructor is useful for use cases which require detailed custom
configuration of a [UnityWebRequest](Networking.UnityWebRequest.html). Most
use cases will require the attachment of a
[DownloadHandler](Networking.DownloadHandler.html), an
[UploadHandler](Networking.UploadHandler.html) or both in order to function
propertly.  
  
Additional resources: [Get](Networking.UnityWebRequest.Get.html),
[GetTexture](Networking.UnityWebRequest.GetTexture.html),
[GetAudioClip](Networking.UnityWebRequest.GetAudioClip.html),
[GetAssetBundle](Networking.UnityWebRequest.GetAssetBundle.html),
[Head](Networking.UnityWebRequest.Head.html),
[Post](Networking.UnityWebRequest.Post.html),
[Put](Networking.UnityWebRequest.Put.html),
[Delete](Networking.UnityWebRequest.Delete.html).
