### Description

Is the keyboard visible or sliding into the position on the screen?

Use this property to bring previously hidden keyboard back on the screen.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        // Hides the keyboard if the device is facing down
        // and resumes input if the device is facing up.  
      
        [TouchScreenKeyboard](TouchScreenKeyboard.html) keyboard;  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            if (keyboard != null)
            {
                if ([Input.deviceOrientation](Input-deviceOrientation.html) == [DeviceOrientation.FaceDown](DeviceOrientation.FaceDown.html))
                    keyboard.active = false;
                if ([Input.deviceOrientation](Input-deviceOrientation.html) == [DeviceOrientation.FaceUp](DeviceOrientation.FaceUp.html))
                    keyboard.active = true;
            }
        }  
      
        void OnGUI()
        {
            if ([GUI.Button](GUI.Button.html)(new [Rect](Rect.html)(0, 10, 200, 32), "Open keyboard"))
                keyboard = [TouchScreenKeyboard.Open](TouchScreenKeyboard.Open.html)("text");
        }
    }
