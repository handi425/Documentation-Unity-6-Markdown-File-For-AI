### Description

Enables recording.

When enabled Recorder collects data regardless of Profiler being enabled or
not.  
  
**Note:**  
Set to _false_ to make measurements available immediately for synchronous
testing scenarious.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.Profiling;  
      
    public class Example
    {
        public static void TimeSynchronousMethodWithMarkers()
        {
            var recorder = [Recorder.Get](Profiling.Recorder.Get.html)("MyMarker");
            recorder.enabled = true; // Starts measurements  
      
            // Call method which uses MyMarker
            // MyMethod();  
      
            recorder.enabled = false; // Stops measurements and makes data available immediately
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("MyMarker total time, ns: " + recorder.elapsedNanoseconds);
        }
    }
