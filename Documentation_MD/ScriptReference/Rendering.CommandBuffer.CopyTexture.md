## Declaration

public void

srcHeight,
[Rendering.RenderTargetIdentifier](Rendering.RenderTargetIdentifier.html) dst,

### Parameters

src | The source texture or [RenderTargetIdentifier](Rendering.RenderTargetIdentifier.html).  
---|---  
dst | The destination texture or [RenderTargetIdentifier](Rendering.RenderTargetIdentifier.html).  
srcElement | The element in the source texture to copy from. For example, the [CubemapFace](CubemapFace.html) in a Cubemap or the slice in a texture array. Set the value to `0` if `src` is a 2D texture.  
srcMip | The mipmap level to copy from. The range is `0` through the texture's [Texture.mipmapCount](Texture-mipmapCount.html). The default value is `0`.  
dstElement | The element in the source texture to copy to. For example, the [CubemapFace](CubemapFace.html) in a Cubemap or the slice in a texture array. Set the value to `0` if `dst` is a 2D texture.  
dstMip | The mipmap level to write to. The range is `0` through the texture's [Texture.mipmapCount](Texture-mipmapCount.html). The default value is `0`.  
srcX | The starting x coordinate of `src` to copy from. `0` is the left of the texture.  
srcY | The starting y coordinate of `src` to copy from. `0` is the bottom of the texture.  
srcWidth | The width of `src` to copy.  
srcHeight | The height of `src` to copy.  
dstX | The x coordinate of `dst` to copy to.  
dstY | The y coordinate to `dst` to copy to.  
  
### Description

Adds a command to copy pixel data from one texture to another.

This method adds a command to copy pixel data from one texture to another on
the GPU. If you set [Texture.isReadable](Texture-isReadable.html) to `true`
for both `src` and `dst` textures, the method also copies pixel data on the
CPU.  
  
If you set [Texture.isReadable](Texture-isReadable.html) to `false`,
`CopyTexture` is one of the fastest ways to copy a texture. But to use
`CopyTexture`, the following must be the same in both the source and
destination texture areas:

  * Format. You can also use two compatible formats - for example, [TextureFormat.ARGB32](TextureFormat.ARGB32.html) and [RenderTextureFormat.ARGB32](RenderTextureFormat.ARGB32.html).
  * Size.
  * [RenderTexture.antiAliasing](RenderTexture-antiAliasing.html) values, if the textures are render textures.

You might be able to copy between incompatible formats depending on your
graphics API. For example, on some APIs you can copy between formats with the
same bit width.  
  
Depending on your graphics API, you might not be able to copy between
different types of textures. For more information on compatibility, see
[SystemInfo.copyTextureSupport](SystemInfo-copyTextureSupport.html) and
[CopyTextureSupport](Rendering.CopyTextureSupport.html).  
  
If `src` is a depth-only render texture, you must copy the whole texture, not
part of it. A depth-only render texture has its color buffer set to a [color
format](RenderTexture-graphicsFormat.html) of `None` and its depth buffer set
to a valid [RenderTexture.depthStencilFormat](RenderTexture-
depthStencilFormat.html).  
  
Compressed texture formats add some restrictions to the CopyTexture with a
region variant. For example, PVRTC formats are not supported since they are
not block-based (for these formats you can only copy whole texture or whole
mipmap level). For block-based formats (for instance, DXT, ETC), the region
size and coordinates must be a multiple of compression block size (4 pixels
for DXT).  
  
Even if you set `Texture.isReadable` to true, this method doesn't copy pixel
data on the CPU if you copy only a region of a compressed texture.
