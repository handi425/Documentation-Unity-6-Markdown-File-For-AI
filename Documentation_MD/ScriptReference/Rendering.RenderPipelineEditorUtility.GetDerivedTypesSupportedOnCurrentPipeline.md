            var types = [RenderPipelineEditorUtility.GetDerivedTypesSupportedOnCurrentPipeline](Rendering.RenderPipelineEditorUtility.GetDerivedTypesSupportedOnCurrentPipeline.html)<IBaseClass>();
            foreach (var type in types)
            {
                [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)($"{type.Name} is supported on current Render Pipeline.");
