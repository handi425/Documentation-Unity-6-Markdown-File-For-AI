### Description

Represents a linear 2D transformation between brush UV space and a target XY
space (typically this is a Terrain-local object space.)

The BrushTransform represents a rectangular brush, with scale, rotation, and
skew. The brush is assumed to lie in the [0,1] range in brush UV space.  
  
The transform and its inverse are represented as follows:  
`xy = u * BrushTransform.brushU + v * BrushTransform.brushV +
BrushTransform.brushOrigin`  
`uv = x * BrushTransform.targetX + y * BrushTransform.targetY +
BrushTransform.targetOrigin`  

### Properties

[brushOrigin](TerrainTools.BrushTransform-brushOrigin.html)| (Read Only) Brush
UV origin, in XY space.  
---|---  
[brushU](TerrainTools.BrushTransform-brushU.html)| (Read Only) Brush U vector,
in XY space.  
[brushV](TerrainTools.BrushTransform-brushV.html)| (Read Only) Brush V vector,
in XY space.  
[targetOrigin](TerrainTools.BrushTransform-targetOrigin.html)| (Read Only)
Target XY origin, in Brush UV space.  
[targetX](TerrainTools.BrushTransform-targetX.html)| (Read Only) Target X
vector, in Brush UV space.  
[targetY](TerrainTools.BrushTransform-targetY.html)| (Read Only) Target Y
vector, in Brush UV space.  
  
### Constructors

[BrushTransform](TerrainTools.BrushTransform-ctor.html)| Creates a
BrushTransform.

### Public Methods

[FromBrushUV](TerrainTools.BrushTransform.FromBrushUV.html)| Applies the
transform to convert a Brush UV coordinate to the target XY space.  
---|---  
[GetBrushXYBounds](TerrainTools.BrushTransform.GetBrushXYBounds.html)| Get the
axis-aligned bounding rectangle of the brush, in target XY space.  
[ToBrushUV](TerrainTools.BrushTransform.ToBrushUV.html)| Applies the transform
to convert a target XY coordinate to Brush UV space.  
  
### Static Methods

[FromRect](TerrainTools.BrushTransform.FromRect.html)| Creates an axis-aligned
BrushTransform from a rectangle.
