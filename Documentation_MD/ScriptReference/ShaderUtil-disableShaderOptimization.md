public static bool disableShaderOptimization;

### Description

Disables shader optimization in the Editor.

When you set this to `true`, shader compilers don't optimize your shader code
in the Editor's Scene view and Game view. This can greatly speed up the time
it takes shaders to compile, but can also reduce rendering speed. The effect
will depend on which shader compiler your platform uses - see [Shader
compilation](../Manual/shader-compilation.html).  
  
If you restart the Editor, this setting is reset to `false`.  
  
This setting doesn't affect your built application.
