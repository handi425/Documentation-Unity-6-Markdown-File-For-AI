public NativeArray<LightShadowCasterCullingInfo> perLightInfos;

### Description

An array of
[LightShadowCasterCullingInfo](Rendering.LightShadowCasterCullingInfo.html).

Each entry in this array is associated with the
[VisibleLight](Rendering.VisibleLight.html) at the same position in the array
[CullingResults.visibleLights](Rendering.CullingResults-visibleLights.html).
Therefore, both arrays must have the same size. The
[LightShadowCasterCullingInfo.splitRange](Rendering.LightShadowCasterCullingInfo-
splitRange.html) of each entry describes a range in the array
[ShadowCastersCullingInfos.splitBuffer](Rendering.ShadowCastersCullingInfos-
splitBuffer.html). An entry with
[LightShadowCasterCullingInfo.splitRange](Rendering.LightShadowCasterCullingInfo-
splitRange.html) set to (0,0) will cause shadow casters culling and shadow
maps rendering to be skipped for this light.
