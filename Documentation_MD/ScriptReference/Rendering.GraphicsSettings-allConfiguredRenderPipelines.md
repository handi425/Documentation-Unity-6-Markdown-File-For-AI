public static RenderPipelineAsset[] allConfiguredRenderPipelines;

### Description

An array containing the
[RenderPipelineAsset](Rendering.RenderPipelineAsset.html) instances that
describe the default render pipeline and any quality level overrides.

The default render pipeline is defined in
[GraphicsSettings.defaultRenderPipeline](Rendering.GraphicsSettings-
defaultRenderPipeline.html). The override render pipeline for the current
quality level is defined in [QualitySettings.renderPipeline](QualitySettings-
renderPipeline.html), or you can request the override value for a given
quality level with
[QualitySettings.GetRenderPipelineAssetAt](QualitySettings.GetRenderPipelineAssetAt.html).  
  
This property returns all instances of
[RenderPipelineAsset](Rendering.RenderPipelineAsset.html) that are assigned to
these fields. The same
[RenderPipelineAsset](Rendering.RenderPipelineAsset.html) can appear in this
array more than once, if it is assigned to more than one field.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.Rendering;  
      
    public class AllConfiguredRenderPipelinesExample : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("All Render Pipeline Assets that define the default render pipeline, or an override: ");
            foreach (var asset in [GraphicsSettings.allConfiguredRenderPipelines](Rendering.GraphicsSettings-allConfiguredRenderPipelines.html))
            {
                [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)(asset.name);
            }
        }
    }
