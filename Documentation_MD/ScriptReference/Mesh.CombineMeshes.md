## Declaration

public void CombineMeshes(CombineInstance[] combine, bool mergeSubMeshes =
true, bool useMatrices = true, bool hasLightmapData = false);

### Parameters

combine | Descriptions of the Meshes to combine.  
---|---  
mergeSubMeshes | Defines whether Meshes should be combined into a single sub-mesh.  
useMatrices | Defines whether the transforms supplied in the CombineInstance array should be used or ignored.  
hasLightmapData | Defines whether to transform the input Mesh lightmap UV data using the lightmap scale offset data in [CombineInstance](CombineInstance.html) structs.  
  
### Description

Combines several Meshes into this Mesh.

Combining Meshes is useful for performance optimization.  
  
If `mergeSubMeshes` is true, all the Meshes are combined together into a
single sub-mesh. Otherwise, each Mesh is placed in a different sub-mesh. If
all Meshes share the same Material, this property should be set to true.  
  
If `useMatrices` is true, the transform matrices in
[CombineInstance](CombineInstance.html) structs are used. Otherwise, they are
ignored.  
  
Set `hasLightmapData` to true to transform the input Mesh lightmap UV data
using the lightmap scale offset data in
[CombineInstance](CombineInstance.html) structs. The Meshes must share the
same lightmap texture.  
  
For the combined Meshes to be in the same position as the parent Mesh occupies
before the use of the method, save the parent Mesh's position and rotation
then set these values to zero before you combine the Meshes. Once the
combination is complete, set the parent Mesh's position and rotation back to
the original values.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    // Copy meshes from children into the parent's [Mesh](Mesh.html).
    // [CombineInstance](CombineInstance.html) stores the list of meshes.  These are combined
    // and assigned to the attached [Mesh](Mesh.html).

    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            [MeshFilter](MeshFilter.html)[] meshFilters = GetComponentsInChildren<[MeshFilter](MeshFilter.html)>();
            [CombineInstance](CombineInstance.html)[] combine = new [CombineInstance](CombineInstance.html)[meshFilters.Length];  
      
            int i = 0;
            while (i < meshFilters.Length)
            {
                combine[i].mesh = meshFilters[i].sharedMesh;
                combine[i].transform = meshFilters[i].transform.localToWorldMatrix;
                meshFilters[i].gameObject.SetActive(false);  
      
                i++;
            }  
      
            [Mesh](Mesh.html) mesh = new [Mesh](Mesh.html)();
            mesh.CombineMeshes(combine);
            transform.GetComponent<[MeshFilter](MeshFilter.html)>().sharedMesh = mesh;
            transform.gameObject.SetActive(true);
        }
    }
