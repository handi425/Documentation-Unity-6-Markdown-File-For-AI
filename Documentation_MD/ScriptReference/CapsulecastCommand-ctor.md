## Declaration

public CapsulecastCommand([Vector3](Vector3.html) p1, [Vector3](Vector3.html)
p2, float radius, [Vector3](Vector3.html) direction,
[QueryParameters](QueryParameters.html) queryParameters, float distance);

### Parameters

p1 | The center of the sphere at the `start` of the capsule.  
---|---  
p2 | The center of the sphere at the `end` of the capsule.  
radius | The radius of the capsule.  
direction | The direction of the capsule cast.  
queryParameters | Structure for specifying additional parameters for a batch query such as layer mask, hit triggers and hit backfaces.  
distance | The maximum length of the sweep.  
  
### Description

Creates a CapsulecastCommand.

This command is run in the default physics scene.
