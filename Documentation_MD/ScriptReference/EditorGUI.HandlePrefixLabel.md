## Declaration

public static void HandlePrefixLabel([Rect](Rect.html) totalPosition,
[Rect](Rect.html) labelPosition, [GUIContent](GUIContent.html) label, int id =
0, [GUIStyle](GUIStyle.html) style = EditorStyles.label);

### Parameters

totalPosition | Rectangle on the screen to use in total for both the label and the control.  
---|---  
labelPosition | Rectangle on the screen to use for the label.  
label | Label to show for the control.  
id | The unique ID of the control. If none specified, the ID of the following control is used.  
style | Optional [GUIStyle](GUIStyle.html) to use for the label.  
  
### Description

Makes a label for some control.

HandlePrefixLabel is like PrefixLabel but allows custom control over the label
position by supplying its [Rect](Rect.html) explicitly. PrefixLabel or
HandlePrefixLabel should be used when creating a control with a connected
label. It ensures that when the label is clicked, the control will get
keyboard focus. For this reason it is important that the same ID is supplied
to PrefixLabel or HandlePrefixLabel as to the control itself. It is also
possible to not supply a Control ID, in which case the one from the
immediately following control is automatically used.
