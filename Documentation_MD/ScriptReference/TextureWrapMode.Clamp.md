### Description

Clamps the texture to the last pixel at the edge.

This is useful for preventing wrapping artifacts when mapping an image onto an
object and you don't want the texture to tile. UV coordinates will be clamped
to the range 0...1. When UVs are larger than 1 or smaller than 0, the last
pixel at the border will be used.  
  
This mode is called "clamp to edge" in graphics APIs like Vulkan, Metal and
OpenGL.
