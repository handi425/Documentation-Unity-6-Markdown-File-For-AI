public [Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) connectedBody;

### Description

The Rigidbody2D object to which the other end of the joint is attached (ie,
the object without the joint component).

If this property is set to null then the joint attaches to a fixed point in
space rather than another Rigidbody2D.  
  
Unity does not support connecting a joint to a [Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html)
in a different [Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html) that is using a local
physics Scene. If a joint is connected to a [Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html),
and then that [Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) is moved to a
[Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html) that uses
[LocalPhysicsMode.Physics2D](SceneManagement.LocalPhysicsMode.Physics2D.html),
then the joint is automatically disconnected from the
[Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html).  
  
Additional resources: [Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html),
[LocalPhysicsMode](SceneManagement.LocalPhysicsMode.html),
[Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) and
[collideConnected](Joint2D-collideConnected.html).
