that completes when the read operation completes.  
---|---  
[ReadCount](Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.ReadHandle.ReadCount.html)| The number of

[GetBytesRead](Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.ReadHandle.GetBytesRead.html)| Returns
the total number of bytes read by all the ReadCommand operations the

[GetBytesReadArray](Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.ReadHandle.GetBytesReadArray.html)|
