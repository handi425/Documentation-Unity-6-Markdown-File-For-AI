## Declaration

public ProfilerTimeSampleSelection(long frameIndex, string threadGroupName,
string threadName, ulong threadId, int rawSampleIndex, string sampleName);

## Declaration

public ProfilerTimeSampleSelection(long frameIndex, string threadGroupName,
string threadName, ulong threadId, IList<int> rawSampleIndices, string
sampleName);

## Declaration

public
ProfilerTimeSampleSelection([Profiling.ProfilerTimeSampleSelection](Profiling.ProfilerTimeSampleSelection.html)
selection);

### Parameters

frameIndex | The 0 based index of the frame the sample exists in. Note that the Profiler Window UI shows the frame index as n+1. When this value is outside of the range described by [ProfilerWindow.firstAvailableFrameIndex](ProfilerWindow-firstAvailableFrameIndex.html) and [ProfilerWindow.lastAvailableFrameIndex](ProfilerWindow-lastAvailableFrameIndex.html), or smaller than 0, Unity will throw an ArgumentOutOfRangeException.  
---|---  
threadGroupName | The name of the thread group. An empty string, which means the thread isn't part of a thread group. "Job", "Loading" and "Scripting Threads" are examples of such thread group names.  
threadName | The name of the thread, e.g. "Main Thread", "Render Thread" or "Worker 0". When this value is null or an empty string, Unity will throw an ArgumentException.  
threadId | The ID of the thread. When the default value of [FrameDataView.invalidThreadId](Profiling.FrameDataView-invalidThreadId.html) is passed, Unity searches for the sample in the first thread matching the provided threadGroupName and threadName. Specify this threadId if there are multiple threads with the same name. Use a RawFrameDataView.threadId or HierarchyFrameDataView.threadId to retrieve the ID to a specific thread, if you need it to be specific.  
rawSampleIndex | The raw index of a sample, i.e. the index as if would be used with [RawFrameDataView](Profiling.RawFrameDataView.html) and NOT an Item ID as it would be used with [HierarchyFrameDataView](Profiling.HierarchyFrameDataView.html). Use HierarchyFrameDataView.ViewMode.MergeSamplesWithTheSameName to get raw sample indices when working with [HierarchyFrameDataView](Profiling.HierarchyFrameDataView.html).  
sampleName | The name of the sample. When this value is null or empty, it will be filled by Unity on making a valid selection by passing this object to [IProfilerFrameTimeViewSampleSelectionController.SetSelection](Profiling.IProfilerFrameTimeViewSampleSelectionController.SetSelection.html).  
rawSampleIndices | A list of sample indices as used with [RawFrameDataView](Profiling.RawFrameDataView.html) and NOT a list of Item ID as would be used with [HierarchyFrameDataView](Profiling.HierarchyFrameDataView.html). Use HierarchyFrameDataView.ViewMode.MergeSamplesWithTheSameName to get raw sample indices when working with [HierarchyFrameDataView](Profiling.HierarchyFrameDataView.html). When this list is empty, Unity throws an ArgumentException.  
selection | An existing selection to make a copy of. When this value is null, Unity throws an ArgumentNullException.  
  
### Description

Constructs a selection object that can be passed to
[IProfilerFrameTimeViewSampleSelectionController.SetSelection](Profiling.IProfilerFrameTimeViewSampleSelectionController.SetSelection.html)
to change the selection.

**Throws:**  
_System.ArgumentException_ if _threadName_ or _rawSampleIndices_ is empty.
_System.ArgumentNullException_ if _threadName_ or _selection_ is null.
_System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException_ if _frameIndex_ When this value is
outside of the range described by
[ProfilerWindow.firstAvailableFrameIndex](ProfilerWindow-
firstAvailableFrameIndex.html) and
[ProfilerWindow.lastAvailableFrameIndex](ProfilerWindow-
lastAvailableFrameIndex.html), or smaller than 0.
_System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException_ if _rawSampleIndex_ or any index in
_rawSampleIndices_ is smaller than 0.
