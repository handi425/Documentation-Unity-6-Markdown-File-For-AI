[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-ArticulationBody.html "Go to
ArticulationBody Component in the Manual")

## Declaration

public void TeleportRoot([Vector3](Vector3.html) position,
[Quaternion](Quaternion.html) rotation);

### Parameters

position | The new position of the root articulation body.  
---|---  
rotation | The new orientation of the root articulation body.  
  
### Description

Teleport the root body of the articulation to a new pose.

Articulations are immutable once created, so it's not possible to change
positions, orientations or velocities of the articulation bodies. However, you
can still move the root body of the articulation with this function. To do so,
call the function with the root body of the articulation. Assign zero vectors
to ArticulationBody.velocity and
[ArticulationBody.angularVelocity](ArticulationBody-angularVelocity.html) of
the root articulation to reset the movement after
[ArticulationBody.TeleportRoot](ArticulationBody.TeleportRoot.html).
