CustomRenderTexture Component in the Manual")

## Declaration

public void Initialize();

### Description

Initializes the Custom Render Texture at the start of the next frame. Unity
calls /Initialise()/ before
/[CustomRenderTexture.Update](CustomRenderTexture.Update.html)/.

You can use /initialize()/ to reset a Custom Render Texture or to execute two
passes after each other, where one occurs in /initialize()/ and the other in
/[CustomRenderTexture.Update](CustomRenderTexture.Update.html)/. When you call
/initialize ()/, Unity uses the settings the Custom Render Texture has when
Unity renders it. This means if you call /intialize()/ more than once when you
have changed settings between calls, Unity runs the initialize render multiple
times with the last settings you applied. Additional resources: [Custom Render
Textures](../Manual/class-CustomRenderTexture.html).
