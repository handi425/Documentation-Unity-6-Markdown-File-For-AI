**Obsolete** DrawShadows is obsolete and replaced with the RendererList API:
construct a RendererList using
ScriptableRenderContext.CreateShadowRendererList and execture it using
CommandBuffer.DrawRendererList.

## Declaration

public void DrawShadows(ref
[Rendering.ShadowDrawingSettings](Rendering.ShadowDrawingSettings.html)
settings);

### Parameters

settings | Specifies which set of shadow casters to draw, and how to draw them.  
---|---  
  
### Description

Schedules the drawing of shadow casters for a single Light.

Please note that in the case of DrawShadows called multiple times for the same
light and using split spheres, shadow casters whose shadow volumes are fully
covered by an earlier split will be discarded in following splits for
performance reasons. One should thus use the split with the smallest index in
case of split overlaps.
