GetSRGBFormat([Experimental.Rendering.GraphicsFormat](Experimental.Rendering.GraphicsFormat.html)
format);

### Description

Returns the equivalent sRGB format of a GraphicsFormat. For example, this
function returns kFormatR8G8B8A8_SRGB if the input is kFormatR8G8B8A8_UNorm.
If the input GraphicsFormat is already sRGB, this function returns the input
GraphicsFormat. If there is no equivalent sRGB format, this function returns
the input GraphicsFormat.
