## Declaration

public static RaycastHit[] BoxCastAll([Vector3](Vector3.html) center,
[Vector3](Vector3.html) halfExtents, [Vector3](Vector3.html) direction,
[Quaternion](Quaternion.html) orientation = Quaternion.identity, float
maxDistance = Mathf.Infinity, int layerMask = DefaultRaycastLayers,
[QueryTriggerInteraction](QueryTriggerInteraction.html)
queryTriggerInteraction = QueryTriggerInteraction.UseGlobal);

### Parameters

center | Center of the box.  
---|---  
halfExtents | Half the size of the box in each dimension.  
direction | The direction in which to cast the box.  
orientation | Rotation of the box.  
maxDistance | The max length of the cast.  
layermask | A [Layer mask](../Manual/Layers.html) that is used to selectively ignore colliders when casting a capsule.  
queryTriggerInteraction | Specifies whether this query should hit Triggers.  
  
### Returns

**RaycastHit[]** All colliders that were hit.

### Description

Like [Physics.BoxCast](Physics.BoxCast.html), but returns all hits.

**Notes:** For colliders that overlap the box at the start of the sweep,
[RaycastHit.normal](RaycastHit-normal.html) is set opposite to the direction
of the sweep, [RaycastHit.distance](RaycastHit-distance.html) is set to zero,
and the zero vector gets returned in [RaycastHit.point](RaycastHit-
point.html). You might want to check whether this is the case in your
particular query and perform additional queries to refine the result.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
**Known Issue**. Please check with the Issue Tracker at
