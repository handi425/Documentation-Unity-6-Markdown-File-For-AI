### Description

Creates a list of build sources directly from the current geometry in the
specified editor stage.

The collection can be controlled in terms of layers, type of geometry and by
collecting either by hierarchy or volume. The `stageProxy` parameter is used
for picking objects from either the main stage or the stage of a prefab opened
for editing. At runtime that parameter is ignored since objects can only be
part of the main scenes. All main scenes are part of the same main stage while
prefab scenes are each assigned to its own separate prefab stage.

## Declaration

public static void CollectSourcesInStage([Bounds](Bounds.html)
includedWorldBounds, int includedLayerMask,
[AI.NavMeshCollectGeometry](AI.NavMeshCollectGeometry.html) geometry, int
defaultArea, List<NavMeshBuildMarkup> markups,
[SceneManagement.Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html) stageProxy,
List<NavMeshBuildSource> results);

### Parameters

includedWorldBounds | The queried objects must overlap these bounds to be included in the results.  
---|---  
includedLayerMask | Specifies which layers are included in the query.  
geometry | Which type of geometry to collect - e.g. physics colliders.  
defaultArea | Area type to assign to results, unless modified by NavMeshMarkup.  
markups | List of markups which allows finer control over how objects are collected.  
stageProxy | Results are selected only from the stage to which this scene belongs.  
results | List where results are stored, the list is cleared at the beginning of the call.  
  
### Description

Collects renderers or physics colliders, and terrains within a volume.

## Declaration

public static void CollectSourcesInStage([Bounds](Bounds.html)
includedWorldBounds, int includedLayerMask,
[AI.NavMeshCollectGeometry](AI.NavMeshCollectGeometry.html) geometry, int
defaultArea, bool generateLinksByDefault, List<NavMeshBuildMarkup> markups,
bool includeOnlyMarkedObjects,
[SceneManagement.Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html) stageProxy,
List<NavMeshBuildSource> results);

### Parameters

includedWorldBounds | The queried objects must overlap these bounds to be included in the results.  
---|---  
includedLayerMask | Specifies which layers are included in the query.  
geometry | Which type of geometry to collect - e.g. physics colliders.  
defaultArea | Area type to assign to results, unless modified by NavMeshMarkup.  
generateLinksByDefault | If true, all the source will be considered for generating links. Otherwise, only the marked sources will be considered.  
markups | List of markups which allows finer control over how objects are collected.  
includeOnlyMarkedObjects | Specifies if only objects with markups are collected.  
stageProxy | Results are selected only from the stage to which this scene belongs.  
results | List where results are stored, the list is cleared at the beginning of the call.  
  
### Description

Collects renderers or physics colliders, and terrains within a volume.

[SceneManagement.Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html) stageProxy,
List<NavMeshBuildSource> results);

### Parameters

---|---  
includedLayerMask | Specifies which layers are included in the query.  
geometry | Which type of geometry to collect - e.g. physics colliders.  
defaultArea | Area type to assign to results, unless modified by NavMeshMarkup.  
markups | List of markups which allows finer control over how objects are collected.  
stageProxy | Results are selected only from the stage to which this scene belongs.  
results | List where results are stored, the list is cleared at the beginning of the call.  
  
### Description

Collects renderers or physics colliders, and terrains within a transform
hierarchy.
