## Declaration

public static bool IsTouchingLayers([Collider2D](Collider2D.html) collider,
int layerMask = Physics2D.AllLayers);

### Parameters

Collider | The Collider to check if it is touching Colliders on the `layerMask`.  
---|---  
layerMask | Any Colliders on any of these layers count as touching.  
  
### Returns

**bool** Whether the `Collider` is touching any Colliders on the specified
`layerMask` or not.

### Description

Checks whether the `Collider` is touching any Colliders on the specified
`layerMask` or not.

It is important to understand that checking if Colliders are touching or not
is performed against the last physics engine update i.e. the state of touching
Colliders at that time. If you have just added a new
[Collider2D](Collider2D.html) or have moved a [Collider2D](Collider2D.html)
but a physics update has not yet taken place then the Colliders will not be
shown as touching. The touching state is identical to that indicated by the
physics collision or trigger callbacks.
