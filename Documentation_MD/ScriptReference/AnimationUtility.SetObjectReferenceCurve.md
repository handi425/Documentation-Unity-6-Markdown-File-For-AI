## Declaration

public static void SetObjectReferenceCurve([AnimationClip](AnimationClip.html)
clip, [EditorCurveBinding](EditorCurveBinding.html) binding,
ObjectReferenceKeyframe[] keyframes);

### Parameters

clip | The animation clip to modify.  
---|---  
binding | The bindings that define the paths and the properties of each curve.  
keyframes | Array of Object reference values over time. Setting this to null will remove the curve.  
  
### Description

Adds, modifies, or removes an object reference curve in an animation clip.

Unity has two types of animation: float curve and object reference curve. A
float curve is a classic curve that animates a float property over time. An
object reference curve is a construct that animates an object reference
property over time.  
  
This method modifies object reference curves. For float curves, see
[AnimationUtility.SetEditorCurve](AnimationUtility.SetEditorCurve.html).
