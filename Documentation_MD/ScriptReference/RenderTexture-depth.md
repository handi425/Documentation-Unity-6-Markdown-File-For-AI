Component in the Manual")

public int depth;

### Description

The precision of the render texture's depth buffer in bits (0, 16, 24 and 32
are supported).

Set the format of the Depth/Stencil buffer. The selected format depends on the
available formats on the platform and the desired format for 24bit depth. See
[GraphicsFormatUtility.GetDepthStencilFormat](Experimental.Rendering.GraphicsFormatUtility.GetDepthStencilFormat.html)
for more information on how the format is selected.  
  
The property returns the actual number of bits for depth in the selected
format. This can be different than the number of bits that was set if no
format with that exact number of depth bits is available on the platform.
[RenderTexture.depthStencilFormat](RenderTexture-depthStencilFormat.html)
returns the actual format that was selected.  
  
Set the format directly using
[RenderTexture.depthStencilFormat](RenderTexture-depthStencilFormat.html) if
you need to control exactly what format is used.  
  
Additional resources: [format](RenderTexture-graphicsFormat.html),
[width](RenderTexture-width.html), [height](RenderTexture-height.html).
