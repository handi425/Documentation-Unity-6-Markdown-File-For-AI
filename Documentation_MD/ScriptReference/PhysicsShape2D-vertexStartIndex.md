public int vertexStartIndex;

### Description

The start index for the geometry of this shape within the
[PhysicsShapeGroup2D](PhysicsShapeGroup2D.html).

Multiple [PhysicsShape2D](PhysicsShape2D.html) in a
[PhysicsShapeGroup2D](PhysicsShapeGroup2D.html) are represented as a single
list of vertices. This index is the start of this shape within that list.

[GetShapeVertices](PhysicsShapeGroup2D.GetShapeVertices.html).
