## Declaration

public void SetConstantBuffer(string name,
[GraphicsBuffer](GraphicsBuffer.html) buffer, int offset, int size);

### Parameters

nameID | The ID of the property name for the constant buffer in shader code. Use [Shader.PropertyToID](Shader.PropertyToID.html) to get this ID.  
---|---  
name | The name of the buffer to bind as constant buffer.  
buffer | The buffer to bind as constant buffer.  
offset | The offset in bytes from the beginning of the ComputeBuffer to bind. Must be a multiple of [SystemInfo.constantBufferOffsetAlignment](SystemInfo-constantBufferOffsetAlignment.html), or 0 if that value is 0.  
size | The number of bytes to bind.  
  
### Description

Sets a [ComputeBuffer](ComputeBuffer.html) or
[GraphicsBuffer](GraphicsBuffer.html) as a named constant buffer for the
ComputeShader.

You can use this method to override all of the parameters in a compute shader
constant buffer with the contents of a [ComputeBuffer](ComputeBuffer.html) or
[GraphicsBuffer](GraphicsBuffer.html).  
  
To use this method, the following must be true:

  * The [ComputeBuffer](ComputeBuffer.html) or [GraphicsBuffer](GraphicsBuffer.html) must have been created with a corresponding [ComputeBufferType.Constant](ComputeBufferType.Constant.html) or [GraphicsBuffer.Target.Constant](GraphicsBuffer.Target.Constant.html) flag.
  * All the shader variants for this Material must use the same constant buffer layout for the given constant buffer.
  * The data layout of the constant buffer must match exactly the data provided in the buffer.

If the above conditions are not met, the buffer might not be bound correctly
and so regular parameters will be picked up. Alternatively visual artifacts
might occur.  
  
The data layout of the constant buffer may be different depending on the
graphics API. This means `SetConstantBuffer` might overwrite data or set
variables to the wrong values. See [Writing shaders for different graphics
APIs](../Manual/SL-PlatformDifferences.html) for more information.  
  
After this function has been called with a non-null ComputeBuffer or
GraphicsBuffer, you can no longer manually set the value of a variable inside
the overridden constant buffer. Calls to
[ComputeShader.SetFloat](ComputeShader.SetFloat.html) and similar where the
given property name ID points to a variable inside the overridden constant
buffer will have no effect.  
  
Constant buffers are bound to all kernels in a
[ComputeShader](ComputeShader.html).

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
