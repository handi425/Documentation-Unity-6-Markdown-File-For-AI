This flag is not set by default. When it is set, the Search Picker window will
not be able to switch between text mode and builder mode, no matter what mode
it is already in.

    
    
    [[SearchContext](Search.SearchContext.html)("t:material", "asset", [SearchViewFlags.DisableBuilderModeToggle](Search.SearchViewFlags.DisableBuilderModeToggle.html))]
