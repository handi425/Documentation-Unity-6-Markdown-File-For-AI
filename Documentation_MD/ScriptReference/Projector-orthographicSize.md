[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-Projector.html "Go to Projector Component
in the Manual")

public float orthographicSize;

### Description

Projection's half-size when in orthographic mode.

This is half of the vertical size of the projection volume. Horizontal
projection size varies depending on [aspectRatio](Projector-aspectRatio.html).
Orthographic size is ignored when projection is not orthographic (see
[orthographic](Projector-orthographic.html)). Additional resources: [projector
component](../Manual/class-Projector.html).

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            [Projector](Projector.html) proj = GetComponent<[Projector](Projector.html)>();
            proj.orthographic = true;
            proj.orthographicSize = 2.0f;
        }
    }
