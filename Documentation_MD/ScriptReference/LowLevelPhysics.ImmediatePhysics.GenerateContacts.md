## Declaration

public static int GenerateContacts(ReadOnly<GeometryHolder> geom1,
ReadOnly<GeometryHolder> geom2, ReadOnly<ImmediateTransform> xform1,
ReadOnly<ImmediateTransform> xform2, int pairCount,
NativeArray<ImmediateContact> outContacts, NativeArray<int> outContactCounts,
float contactDistance);

### Parameters

geom1 | The array that holds the first member of each pair of [GeometryHolder](LowLevelPhysics.GeometryHolder.html) objects with shapes assigned.  
---|---  
geom2 | The array that holds the second member of each pair of [GeometryHolder](LowLevelPhysics.GeometryHolder.html) objects with shapes assigned.  
xform1 | The array that holds the first member of each pair of [ImmediateTransform](LowLevelPhysics.ImmediateTransform.html)s.  
xform2 | The array that holds the second member of each pair of [ImmediateTransform](LowLevelPhysics.ImmediateTransform.html)s.  
pairCount | The number of pairs provided in the [GeometryHolder](LowLevelPhysics.GeometryHolder.html) and [ImmediateTransform](LowLevelPhysics.ImmediateTransform.html) arrays.  
outContacts | The output array of contacts that were generated.  
outContactCounts | The output array of how many contacts were generated for each pair.  
contactDistance | The distance at which contacts begin to be generated between the pairs.  
  
### Returns

**int** Returns the total number of contact points that were generated.

### Description

Generates the contact points for all the given pairs of shapes. Stores the
resulting contacts in the
[ImmediateContact](LowLevelPhysics.ImmediateContact.html) array, and the
number of contacts per each pair in the `outContactCounts` array.

This code sample defines how many pairs of objects PhysX should expect in the
scene. You can set a specific number for a small contact check or, if you
intend to run a more complex simulation, you might want to implement
broadphase filtering to find out how many pairs of objects will interact. The
easiest and least performant option is to put all the possible pairs of bodies
into a GenerateContacts function that exists in the scene. This example shows
a basic setup of manually adding two pairs of bodies and checking for contacts
between them.
