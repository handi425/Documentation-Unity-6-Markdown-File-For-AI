public [RenderTexture](RenderTexture.html) sourceRenderTexture;

### Description

(Read Only) Render target that stores the original data from the Terrain
tiles.

This RenderTexture contains all of the data collected from all Terrain tiles
that intersect the PaintContext. The RenderTexture is created by
[PaintContext.CreateRenderTargets](TerrainTools.PaintContext.CreateRenderTargets.html),
and populated by one of the Gather functions
([PaintContext.GatherHeightmap](TerrainTools.PaintContext.GatherHeightmap.html),
[PaintContext.GatherAlphamap](TerrainTools.PaintContext.GatherAlphamap.html)
or
[PaintContext.GatherNormals](TerrainTools.PaintContext.GatherNormals.html)).  
  
Additional resources: [PaintContext](TerrainTools.PaintContext.html),
[PaintContext.destinationRenderTexture](TerrainTools.PaintContext-
destinationRenderTexture.html).
