public static [Vector2](Vector2.html) operator -([Vector2](Vector2.html) a,
[Vector2](Vector2.html) b);

### Returns

**Vector2** The difference between the two vectors, returned as a Vector2
struct.

### Description

Subtracts one vector from another.

Subtracts each component of `b` from `a`.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            // Create two vectors.
            [Vector2](Vector2.html) A = new [Vector2](Vector2.html)(1, 2);
            [Vector2](Vector2.html) B = new [Vector2](Vector2.html)(3, 2);
            
            // Subtract vector B from vector A.
            [Vector2](Vector2.html) C = A - B;
            
            // Print the result.
            print(C);
        }
    }

public static [Vector2](Vector2.html) operator -([Vector2](Vector2.html) a);

### Returns

**Vector2** The negative of the vector, returned as a Vector2 struct.

### Description

Negates a vector.

Each component in the vector is negated, to obtain its negative value. The
negative of a vector has the same magnitude but opposite direction

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
           // Create a vector.
           [Vector2](Vector2.html) A = new [Vector2](Vector2.html)(1, 2);
           
           // Find the negative value.
           [Vector2](Vector2.html) B = - A;
      
           // Print the result.
            print(B + " is the negative of " + A);
        }
    }
