public
[Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.FileStatus](Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.FileStatus.html)
Status;

### Description

The current status of this FileHandle.

After you call
[AsyncReadManager.OpenFileAsync](Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.AsyncReadManager.OpenFileAsync.html),
the FileHandle enters the
[FileStatus.Pending](Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.FileStatus.Pending.html) state.
Once the open operation completes, the status changes to either
[FileStatus.Open](Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.FileStatus.Open.html) or
[FileStatus.Closed](Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.FileStatus.Closed.html) (if the
file failed to open).  
  
Note: When the close operation completes, the FileHandle is disposed and
becomes invalid. You can use the JobHandle returned by
[Close](Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.FileHandle.Close.html) to check for close
operation completion.
