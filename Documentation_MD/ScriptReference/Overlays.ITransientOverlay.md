### Description

Transient Overlays are a type of [Overlay](Overlays.Overlay.html) that is not
controlled by a user, and only drawn in the active Scene View when requested
by the [visible](Overlays.ITransientOverlay-visible.html) property.
Implementing [ITransientOverlay](Overlays.ITransientOverlay.html) in an
[Overlay](Overlays.Overlay.html) class designates it for this special
behavior.

### Properties

[visible](Overlays.ITransientOverlay-visible.html)| Use visible to enable or
disable the rendering of this Overlay.
