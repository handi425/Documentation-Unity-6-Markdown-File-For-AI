## Declaration

public static [Event](Event.html) KeyboardEvent(string key);

### Parameters

key | A string representing keyboard keys and modifiers.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**Event** A new Event with [EventType.KeyDown](EventType.KeyDown.html) and the
requested [KeyCode](KeyCode.html) and optional EventModifier.

### Description

Create a keyboard event.

This is useful when you need to check if a certain key has been pressed -
possibly with modifiers. The syntax for the key string is a key name (same as
in the Input Manager), optionally prefixed by any number of modifiers:  
& = Alternate, ^ = Control, % = Command/Windows key, # = Shift  
Examples: &f12 = Alternate + F12, "^[0]" = Control + keypad0 .  
  
  
See the [Input Manager](../Manual/class-InputManager.html) manual page for
more information on key names.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        // Detects if the Enter key was pressed
        void OnGUI()
        {
            [GUILayout.Label](GUILayout.Label.html)("Press Enter To Start Game");  
      
            if (Event.current.Equals([Event.KeyboardEvent](Event.KeyboardEvent.html)("[enter]")))
            {
                Application.LoadLevel(1);
            }  
      
            if (Event.current.Equals([Event.KeyboardEvent](Event.KeyboardEvent.html)("return")))
            {
     		[Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("I said enter, not return - try the keypad");
            }
        }
    }
