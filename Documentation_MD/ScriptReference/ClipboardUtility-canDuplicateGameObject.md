public static Func<GameObject,bool> canDuplicateGameObject;

### Description

Optional filtering functions invoked to determine if a GameObject can be
duplicated before any action is taken.

All registered delegates of canDuplicateGameObject will be evaluated and must
return true for a GameObject to be duplicated.
[Selection.gameObjects](Selection-gameObjects.html) will be updated with the
GameObjects that successfully passed the filtering functions.  
  
Subscribe to the [rejectedGameObjects](ClipboardUtility-
rejectedGameObjects.html) event to receive a callback, providing an array of
GameObjects that failed one or more of the filtering functions.
