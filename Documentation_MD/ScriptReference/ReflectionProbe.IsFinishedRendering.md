    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    
    public class UpdateProbeEvery2Seconds : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        private int RenderId = -1;
        private [ReflectionProbe](ReflectionProbe.html) TheProbe;
        public [RenderTexture](RenderTexture.html) TargetTexture;  
      
        IEnumerator Start()
        {
            TheProbe = GetComponent<[ReflectionProbe](ReflectionProbe.html)>();  
      
            // set the probe to render in time-slicing mode and make sure all faces of the cubemap render the same frame.
            TheProbe.timeSlicingMode = UnityEngine.Rendering.ReflectionProbeTimeSlicingMode.AllFacesAtOnce;
            while (true)
            {
                yield return new [WaitForSeconds](WaitForSeconds.html)(2.0f);  
      
                // render the probe over several frames and blit into TargetTexture once finished.
                RenderId = TheProbe.RenderProbe(TargetTexture);
            }
        }  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            if (TheProbe.IsFinishedRendering(RenderId))
            {
                // Probe has finished rendering, do something with the render texture
            }
        }
