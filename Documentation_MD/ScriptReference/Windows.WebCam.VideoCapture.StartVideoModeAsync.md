### Description

Asynchronously starts video mode.

Activates the web camera with the settings specified in
[CameraParameters](Windows.WebCam.CameraParameters.html). Only one
VideoCapture instance can start the video mode at any given time. After
starting the video mode, you can record videos via
[VideoCapture.StartRecordingAsync](Windows.WebCam.VideoCapture.StartRecordingAsync.html).
Video mode can impact performance, so make sure to call
[VideoCapture.StopVideoModeAsync](Windows.WebCam.VideoCapture.StopVideoModeAsync.html)
when you are done recording.
