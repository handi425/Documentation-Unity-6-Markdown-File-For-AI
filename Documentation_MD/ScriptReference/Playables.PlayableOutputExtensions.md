### Description

Extensions for all the types that implements
[IPlayableOutput](Playables.IPlayableOutput.html).

Extension methods are static methods that can be called as if they were
instance methods on the extended type.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.Playables;  
      
    public class ExamplePlayableBehaviour : [PlayableBehaviour](Playables.PlayableBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            [PlayableGraph](Playables.PlayableGraph.html) graph = [PlayableGraph.Create](Playables.PlayableGraph.Create.html)();
            [ScriptPlayableOutput](Playables.ScriptPlayableOutput.html) scriptOutput = [ScriptPlayableOutput.Create](Playables.ScriptPlayableOutput.Create.html)(graph, "MyOutput");  
      
            // Calling method PlayableExtensions.SetWeight on [ScriptPlayableOutput](Playables.ScriptPlayableOutput.html) as if it was an instance method.
            scriptOutput.SetWeight(10);  
      
            // The line above is the same as calling directly [PlayableExtensions.SetDuration](Playables.PlayableExtensions.SetDuration.html), but it is more compact and readable.
            [PlayableOutputExtensions.SetWeight](Playables.PlayableOutputExtensions.SetWeight.html)(scriptOutput, 10);
        }
    }
