### Description

Defines the delegate to use to register for events in which the focus gained
or lost.

This delegate allows you to receive focus change events when implementing code
that does not use the MonoBehviour namespace.  
  
**Note** : When using this delegate to register for focus changed events in
code that uses the MonoBehviour namespace you will also receive events from
the [MonoBehaviour.OnApplicationFocus](MonoBehaviour.OnApplicationFocus.html)
method if you have implemented it.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
**Known Issue**. Please check with the Issue Tracker at
