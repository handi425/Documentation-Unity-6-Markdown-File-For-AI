## Declaration

public static void SetAreaCost(int areaIndex, float cost);

### Parameters

areaIndex | Index of the area to set.  
---|---  
cost | New cost.  
  
### Description

Sets the cost for finding path over geometry of the area type on all agents.

This will replace any custom area costs on all agents, and set the default
cost for new agents that are created after calling the function. The cost must
be larger than 1.0.  
  
Use [GetAreaFromName](AI.NavMesh.GetAreaFromName.html) to find the area index
based on the name of the NavMesh area type.

    
    
    // ToggleWaterCost
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.AI;  
      
    public class ToggleWaterCost : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            if ([Input.anyKeyDown](Input-anyKeyDown.html))
            {
                // Make the water area 10x more costly to traverse.
                [NavMesh.SetAreaCost](AI.NavMesh.SetAreaCost.html)([NavMesh.GetAreaFromName](AI.NavMesh.GetAreaFromName.html)("water"), 10.0f);
            }
        }
    }
