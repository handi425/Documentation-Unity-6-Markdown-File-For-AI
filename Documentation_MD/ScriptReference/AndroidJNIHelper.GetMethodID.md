## Declaration

public static IntPtr GetMethodID(IntPtr javaClass, string methodName);

## Declaration

public static IntPtr GetMethodID(IntPtr javaClass, string methodName, string
signature);

## Declaration

public static IntPtr GetMethodID(IntPtr javaClass, string methodName, string
signature, bool isStatic = false);

### Parameters

javaClass | Raw JNI Java class object (obtained by calling AndroidJNI.FindClass).  
---|---  
methodName | Name of the method as declared in Java.  
signature | Method signature (e.g. obtained by calling AndroidJNIHelper.GetSignature).  
isStatic | Set to `true` for static methods; `false` for instance (nonstatic) methods.  
  
### Description

Scans a particular Java class for a method matching a name and a signature.

The signature comparison is done to allow sub-/base-classes of a class types.
If no signature is provided the first method with the correct name will be
returned.

## Declaration

public static IntPtr GetMethodID(IntPtr jclass, string methodName, object[]
args, bool isStatic);

### Parameters

javaClass | Raw JNI Java class object (obtained by calling AndroidJNI.FindClass).  
---|---  
methodName | Name of the method as declared in Java.  
args | Array with parameters to be passed to the method when invoked.  
isStatic | Set to `true` for static methods; `false` for instance (nonstatic) methods.  
  
### Description

Get a JNI method ID based on calling arguments.

Generic parameter represents the method return type, and the regular method
assumes 'void' return type. Scans a particular Java class for a method
matching a signature based on passed arguments. The signature comparison is
done to allow for sub-/base-classes of the class types.
