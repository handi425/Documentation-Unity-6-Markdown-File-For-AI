## Declaration

public int AddCapsule([Vector2](Vector2.html) vertex0, [Vector2](Vector2.html)
vertex1, float radius);

### Parameters

vertex0 | The position of one end of a capsule shape. This point represents the center point of a logical circle at the end of a capsule.  
---|---  
vertex1 | The position of the opposite end of a capsule shape. This point represents the center point of a logical circle at the opposite end of a capsule.  
radius | The radius of the capsule defining a radius around the `vertex0` and `vertex1` and the area between them.  
  
### Returns

**int** Returns the shape index the shape was added to in the
[PhysicsShapeGroup2D](PhysicsShapeGroup2D.html). This index is used as the
main reference when retrieving a shape.

### Description

Adds a capsule shape
([PhysicsShapeType2D.Capsule](PhysicsShapeType2D.Capsule.html)) to the shape
group.

A capsule shape is comprised of a single edge shape defined by two vertices
(`vertex0` and `vertex1` ) and a `radius` that extends around the length of
the edge and around the vertices.  
  
**NOTE** : A capsule forms a closed shape and does have an interior therefore
its interior is detectable by physics queries etc.
