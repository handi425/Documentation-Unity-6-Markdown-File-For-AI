## Declaration

public void DispatchIndirect(string rayGenFunctionName,
[GraphicsBuffer](GraphicsBuffer.html) argsBuffer, uint argsOffset,
[Camera](Camera.html) camera);

### Parameters

rayGenFunctionName | The name of the ray generation shader.  
---|---  
argsBuffer | Buffer containing dispatch dimensions.  
argsOffset | The byte offset into the buffer where the dispatch dimensions start.  
camera | If you pass this parameter, Unity sets up built-in shader variables related to that camera.  
  
### Description

Dispatches this [RayTracingShader](Rendering.RayTracingShader.html).

This method is similar to [Dispatch](Rendering.RayTracingShader.Dispatch.html)
but the GPU retrieves the dispatch dimensions from `argsBuffer`. The typical
use case is generating arbitrary amount of data using a
[ComputeShader](ComputeShader.html) and then dispatching that data, without
requiring a readback to the CPU to retrieve the data size.  
  
The buffer with arguments, `argsBuffer`, must contain three integer numbers at
given `argsOffset` values representing the dispatch dimensions: width, height
and depth.
