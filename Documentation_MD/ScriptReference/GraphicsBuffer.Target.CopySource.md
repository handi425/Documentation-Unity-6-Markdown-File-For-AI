### Description

GraphicsBuffer can be used as a source for CopyBuffer.

The source buffer for [Graphics.CopyBuffer](Graphics.CopyBuffer.html) or
[CommandBuffer.CopyBuffer](Rendering.CommandBuffer.CopyBuffer.html) must have
`CopySource` target set. This target is most often combined with other target
flags.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class ExampleScript : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            // create a source index buffer and set data for it
            var src = new [GraphicsBuffer](GraphicsBuffer.html)(
                [GraphicsBuffer.Target.Index](GraphicsBuffer.Target.Index.html) | [GraphicsBuffer.Target.CopySource](GraphicsBuffer.Target.CopySource.html),
                3, 2);
            src.SetData(new ushort[] {1, 10, 100});
            // create a destination index buffer and copy source into it
            var dst = new [GraphicsBuffer](GraphicsBuffer.html)(
                [GraphicsBuffer.Target.Index](GraphicsBuffer.Target.Index.html) | [GraphicsBuffer.Target.CopyDestination](GraphicsBuffer.Target.CopyDestination.html),
                3, 2);
            [Graphics.CopyBuffer](Graphics.CopyBuffer.html)(src, dst);  
      
            // check the copied data
            var got = new ushort[3];
            dst.GetData(got);
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)($"copied data: {got[0]}, {got[1]}, {got[2]}");  
      
            // release the buffers
            src.Release();
            dst.Release();
        }
    }
