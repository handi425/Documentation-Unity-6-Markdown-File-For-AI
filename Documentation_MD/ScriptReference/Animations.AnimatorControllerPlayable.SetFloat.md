### Description

Send float values to the AnimatorController to affect transitions.

Use SetFloat in a script to send float values to the AnimatorController in
order to activate transitions. In the AnimatorController, define what values
affect how certain animations transition. This is useful in various
situations, especially in animation cycles such as movement animations where
you might require the character to walk or run depending on the button
pressure applied.
