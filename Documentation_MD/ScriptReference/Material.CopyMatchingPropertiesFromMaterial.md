    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        // Attach this script to a [GameObject](GameObject.html) that has a renderer.
        // Copies any property from mat and assigns it to this transform's material, if the property exists in both materials.  
      
        [Material](Material.html) mat;  
      
        void Start()
