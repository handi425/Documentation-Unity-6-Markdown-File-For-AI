## Declaration

public static float SignedAngle([Vector2](Vector2.html) from,
[Vector2](Vector2.html) to);

### Parameters

from | The vector from which the angular difference is measured.  
---|---  
to | The vector to which the angular difference is measured.  
  
### Returns

**float** The signed angle in degrees between the two vectors.

### Description

Gets the signed angle in degrees between `from` and `to`.

The angle returned is the signed counterclockwise angle between the two
vectors.  
Note: The angle returned will always be between -180 and 180 degrees, because
the method returns the smallest angle between the vectors. That is, it will
never return a reflex angle. Angles are calculated from world origin point
(0,0,0) as the vertex.
