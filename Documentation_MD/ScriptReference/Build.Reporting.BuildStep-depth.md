### Description

The nesting depth of the build step.

The build process is broken down into steps, and steps may themselves be
broken down into sub-steps recursively. The nesting depth indicates how many
higher-level build steps enclose this step. The step that represents the
overall build process has depth 0, the sub-steps of that step have depth 1,
and so on.
