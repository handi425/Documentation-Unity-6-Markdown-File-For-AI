public [SkinQuality](SkinQuality.html) quality;

### Description

The maximum number of bones per vertex that are taken into account during
skinning.

The value can be either One Bone, Two Bones, Four Bones or Auto. Note that
higher bone counts may have a performance cost, especially above 4 bones per
vertex.  
  
This setting does not change the underlying mesh data; it only affects the
number of bone weights that Unity uses when performing skinning. This means
that a mesh can have bone weight data that is unused due to this setting. You
can change this value at runtime.  
  
You can set this value for all meshes in the project using
[QualitySettings.skinWeights](QualitySettings-skinWeights.html). You can set
the maximum number of bone weights that mesh data stores per vertex using
[ModelImporter.maxBonesPerVertex](ModelImporter-maxBonesPerVertex.html).
