public [Color](Color.html) radiusHandleColor;

### Description

Returns or specifies the color of the radius control handle.

This value is multiplied with the value of [Handles.color](Handles-color.html)
at the time [DrawHandle](IMGUI.Controls.ArcHandle.DrawHandle.html) is called.
If [Color.a](Color-a.html) is `0` then the radius handle is disabled. This
property is [Color.clear](Color-clear.html) by default.
