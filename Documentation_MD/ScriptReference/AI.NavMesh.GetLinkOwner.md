## Declaration

public static Object
GetLinkOwner([AI.NavMeshLinkInstance](AI.NavMeshLinkInstance.html) handle);

### Parameters

handle | The identifier of the link instance whose owner needs to be retrieved.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**Object** The object that was passed into
[SetLinkOwner](AI.NavMesh.SetLinkOwner.html) for the specified link instance.  
Returns `null` when no owner object has been assigned or when the link
instance is not valid.

### Description

Gets the object, if any, that is associated with the link instance.

Use this method to obtain a reference to the component that created the link,
or more generally, to any object that contains useful information about this
specific link that is active in the navigation system. We refer to that object
as the "owner". The owner is null for any new link instance created with
[AddLink](AI.NavMesh.AddLink.html). Therefore you need to first call
[SetLinkOwner](AI.NavMesh.SetLinkOwner.html) in order to retrieve the same
object later. This "owner" is also referenced by the
[OffMeshLinkData.owner](AI.OffMeshLinkData-owner.html) property when you query
for the next link on a NavMesh agent's path.  
When the link instance is [removed](NavMeshLinkInstance.Remove.html) the owner
property returns null once again.
