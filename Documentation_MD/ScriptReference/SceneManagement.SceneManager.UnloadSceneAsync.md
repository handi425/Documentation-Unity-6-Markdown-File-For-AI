## Declaration

public static [AsyncOperation](AsyncOperation.html)
UnloadSceneAsync([SceneManagement.Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html) scene,
[SceneManagement.UnloadSceneOptions](SceneManagement.UnloadSceneOptions.html)
options);

### Parameters

sceneBuildIndex | Index of the Scene in BuildSettings.  
---|---  
sceneName | Name or path of the Scene to unload.  
scene | Scene to unload.  
options | Scene unloading options.  
  
### Returns

**AsyncOperation** Use the [AsyncOperation](AsyncOperation.html) to determine
if the operation has completed.

### Description

Destroys all GameObjects associated with the given Scene and removes the Scene
from the SceneManager.

The given Scene name can either be the full Scene path, the path shown in the
Build Settings window or just the Scene name. If only the Scene name is given
this will unload the first Scene in the list that matches. If you have
multiple Scenes with same name but different paths, you should use the full
Scene path. Examples of supported formats:  
`"Scene1"`  
`"Scene2"`  
`"Scenes/Scene3"`  
`"Scenes/Others/Scene3"`  
`"Assets/scenes/others/scene3.unity"`  
  
**Note:** This is case-insensitive and due to it being async there are no
guarantees about completion time.  
**Note:** Assets are currently not unloaded. In order to free up asset memory
call [Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets](Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets.html).  
**Note:** It is not possible to
[UnloadSceneAsync](SceneManagement.SceneManager.UnloadSceneAsync.html) if
there are no scenes to load. For example, a project that has a single scene
cannot use this static member.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
