## Declaration

public static bool DropdownButton([GUIContent](GUIContent.html) content,
[FocusType](FocusType.html) focusType, [GUIStyle](GUIStyle.html) style, params
GUILayoutOption[] options);

### Parameters

content | Text, image and tooltip for this button.  
---|---  
focusType | Whether the button should be selectable by keyboard or not.  
style | Optional style to use.  
options | An optional list of layout options that specify extra layouting properties. Any values passed in here will override settings defined by the `style`.  
Additional resources: [GUILayout.Width](GUILayout.Width.html),
[GUILayout.Height](GUILayout.Height.html),
[GUILayout.MinWidth](GUILayout.MinWidth.html),
[GUILayout.MaxWidth](GUILayout.MaxWidth.html),
[GUILayout.MinHeight](GUILayout.MinHeight.html),
[GUILayout.MaxHeight](GUILayout.MaxHeight.html),
[GUILayout.ExpandWidth](GUILayout.ExpandWidth.html),
[GUILayout.ExpandHeight](GUILayout.ExpandHeight.html).  
  
### Returns

**bool** `true` when the user clicks the button.

### Description

Make a button that reacts to mouse down, for displaying your own dropdown
content.

This control does not do anything but returns true on mouse down when clicked,
as opposed to regular buttons that return true on mouse up.  
  
This can be used for buttons that should open a
[GenericMenu](GenericMenu.html) or your own custom
[EditorWindow](EditorWindow.html) in dropdown form.  
  
When used with a GenericMenu, use GenericMenu.Dropdown and pass the same rect
to the method as was used for the button, which you can obtain using
[GUILayoutUtility.GetLastRect](GUILayoutUtility.GetLastRect.html). Note that
this will only return a valid rect when
[EditorGUILayout.DropdownButton](EditorGUILayout.DropdownButton.html) returns
false. This happens because the last layout event is not used when the click
goes through to open a menu.  
  
When used with a custom EditorWindow, use EditorWindow.ShowAsDropdown and pass
the same rect to the method as was used for the button, which you can obtain
using [GUILayoutUtility.GetLastRect](GUILayoutUtility.GetLastRect.html).
