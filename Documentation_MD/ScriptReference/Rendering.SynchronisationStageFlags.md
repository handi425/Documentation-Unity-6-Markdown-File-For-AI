### Description

Describes the various stages of GPU processing against which the GraphicsFence
can be set and waited against.

The enum values can be combined; for example, a GraphicsFence created with SynchronisationStageFlags.VertexProcessing | SynchronisationStageFlags.ComputeProcessing flags would complete once all previous draw calls have completed their vertex shaders and all previous compute shader dispatches have completed.

### Properties

All aspects of vertex processing in the GPU.  
---|---  
[PixelProcessing](Rendering.SynchronisationStageFlags.PixelProcessing.html)|

[ComputeProcessing](Rendering.SynchronisationStageFlags.ComputeProcessing.html)|
All compute shader dispatch operations.  
[AllGPUOperations](Rendering.SynchronisationStageFlags.AllGPUOperations.html)|
