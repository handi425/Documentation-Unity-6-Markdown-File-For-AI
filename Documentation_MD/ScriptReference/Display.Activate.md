## Declaration

public void Activate();

### Description

Activates an external display. For example, a secondary monitor connected to
the system.

Creates a window with screen width and screen height, and with the default
refresh rate.  
  
Displays have the following indices in the [Display.displays](Display-
displays.html) array:

  * The primary display is `0`.
  * Secondary displays are `1` to `7`.

Make sure an external display is connected before you activate it.  
  
This method works only on desktop platforms.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            // Check the number of monitors connected.
            if (Display.displays.Length > 1)
            {
                // Activate the display 1 (second monitor connected to the system).
                [Display.displays](Display-displays.html)[1].Activate();
            }
        }
    }

refreshRate);

### Description

Windows platforms only. Activates an external display with a specific width,
height and refresh rate. For example, a secondary monitor connected to the
system.

This method only works fully on Windows platforms. If you use this method on
Linux or macOS platforms, the display uses the screen width and height.  
  
Displays have the following indices in the [Display.displays](Display-
displays.html) array:

  * The primary display is `0`.
  * Secondary displays are `1` to `7`.

Make sure an external display is connected before you activate it.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            // Check the number of monitors connected.
            if (Display.displays.Length > 1)
            {
                // Activate the display 1 (second monitor connected to the system).
                [Display.displays](Display-displays.html)[1].Activate(0, 0, new [RefreshRate](RefreshRate.html)() { numerator = 60, denominator = 1 });
            }
        }
    }
