### Description

When the type is marked, all types derived from that type will also be marked.

    
    
    using [System](Rendering.VirtualTexturing.System.html);
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.Scripting;  
      
    public class NewBehaviourScript : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            new Foo();
        }
    }  
      
    [RequireDerived]
    class Foo {}  
      
    // UnusedFoo is not used, however, it will survive managed code stripping due to Foo having the [RequireDerived] attribute.
    class UnusedFoo : Foo
    {
        // Note that unused members of UnusedFoo will still be removed by managed code stripping
        public static void UnusedMethod() {}
    }  
      
    
    // Bar is not used so it will be removed by managed code stripping
    [RequireDerived]
    class Bar {}  
      
    // Because Bar is not used, the [RequireDerived] attribute on Bar has no impact.  UnusedBar will also be removed.
    class UnusedBar : Bar {}
