## Declaration

public bool Intersects([Bounds](Bounds.html) bounds);

### Description

Does another bounding box intersect with this bounding box?

Check if the bounding box comes into contact with another bounding box. This
returns a Boolean that is set to true if there is an intersection between
bounds. Two bounds are intersecting if there is at least one point which is
contained by both bounds.

    
    
    //Attach this script to an empty [GameObject](GameObject.html). Create 2 more GameObjects and attach a [Collider](Collider.html) component on each. Choose these as the "My Object" and "New Object" in the Inspector.
    //This script allows you to move your main [GameObject](GameObject.html) left to right. If it intersects with the other, it outputs the message to the Console.  
      
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class BoundsIntersectExample : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public [GameObject](GameObject.html) m_MyObject, m_NewObject;
        [Collider](Collider.html) m_Collider, m_Collider2;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            //Check that the first [GameObject](GameObject.html) exists in the Inspector and fetch the [Collider](Collider.html)
            if (m_MyObject != null)
                m_Collider = m_MyObject.GetComponent<[Collider](Collider.html)>();  
      
            //Check that the second [GameObject](GameObject.html) exists in the Inspector and fetch the [Collider](Collider.html)
            if (m_NewObject != null)
