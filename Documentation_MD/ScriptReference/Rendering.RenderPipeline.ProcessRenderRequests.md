## Declaration

protected void
ProcessRenderRequests([Rendering.ScriptableRenderContext](Rendering.ScriptableRenderContext.html)
context, [Camera](Camera.html) camera, RequestData renderRequest);

### Parameters

renderRequests | The list of `RenderRequests` to execute.  
---|---  
  
### Description

Executes `RenderRequests` submitted using Camera.SubmitRenderRequests.

Unity calls this method when the user calls Camera.SubmitRenderRequests.  
  
If the active `RenderPipeline` implements this method, Unity updates the
[RenderTexture](RenderTexture.html) assigned to the `results` property of each
[RenderRequest](Camera.RenderRequest.html) with the requested data.  
  
If the active `RenderPipeline` does not implement this method, Unity does
nothing; it performs a no-op, and every
[RenderRequests](Camera.RenderRequest.html) remains in the same state.  
  
If you are creating a custom Scriptable Render Pipeline you must ensure that
you implement this method as described, or do not implement it.
