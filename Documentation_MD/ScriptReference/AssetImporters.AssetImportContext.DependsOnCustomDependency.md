## Declaration

public void DependsOnCustomDependency(string dependency);

### Parameters

dependency | Name of dependency. You can use any name you like, but because these names are global across all your Assets, it can be useful to use a naming convention (eg a path-based naming system as in the example below) to avoid clashes with other custom dependency names.  
---|---  
  
### Description

Allows you to specify that an Asset has a custom dependency.

Use custom dependency if need to setup a dependency to something that can't be
expressed as either an source asset dependency or artifact dependency.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEditor.AssetImporters;
    using UnityEditor.Experimental;
    using UnityEngine.Assertions;
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);  
      
    class MySystem
    {
        public const string CustomDependencyName = "MyProject/[Settings](CameraEditor.Settings.html)";  
      
        public static string GetSetting()
        {
            return "42";
        }  
      
        public static void RegisterCustomDependency()
        {
            // You cannot register a custom dependency during the [Asset](VersionControl.Asset.html) Import process, so this method must be called before the [Asset](VersionControl.Asset.html) is imported.
            UnityEditor.AssetDatabase.RegisterCustomDependency(CustomDependencyName, [Hash128.Compute](Hash128.Compute.html)(GetSetting()));
        }
    }  
      
    class SomeValue : [ScriptableObject](ScriptableObject.html)
    {
        public int value;
    }  
      
    [[ScriptedImporter](AssetImporters.ScriptedImporter.html)(1, "data", AllowCaching = true)]
    public class MyDataImporter : [ScriptedImporter](AssetImporters.ScriptedImporter.html)
    {
        public override void OnImportAsset([AssetImportContext](AssetImporters.AssetImportContext.html) ctx)
        {
            ctx.DependsOnCustomDependency(MySystem.CustomDependencyName);  
      
            var someObj = [ScriptableObject.CreateInstance](ScriptableObject.CreateInstance.html)<SomeValue>();  
      
            var setting = MySystem.GetSetting();
            if (setting == "42")
                someObj.value = 100;
            else
                someObj.value = -1;  
      
            ctx.AddObjectToAsset("someObj", someObj);
        }
    }
