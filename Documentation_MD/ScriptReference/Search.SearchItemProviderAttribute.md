### Description

Attribute used to declare a static method that will create a new search
provider at load time.

    
    
    [SearchItemProvider]
    internal static [SearchProvider](Search.SearchProvider.html) CreateProvider()
    {
        return new [SearchProvider](Search.SearchProvider.html)(id, name)
        {
            filterId = "hex:",
            priority = 99999, // put example provider at a low priority
            showDetailsOptions = [ShowDetailsOptions.Description](Search.ShowDetailsOptions.Description.html) | [ShowDetailsOptions.Preview](Search.ShowDetailsOptions.Preview.html),
            fetchItems = (context, items, provider) =>
            {
                var expression = context.searchQuery;
                if (expression.Length == 6 && IsHex(expression))
                {
                    expression = "#" + expression;
                    items.Add(provider.CreateItem(context, expression, GetColorName(expression),
                        "Look at this " + GetColorName(expression) + " color!",
                        CreateTextureFromColor(expression, 64, 64), null));
                }
                return null;
            },
            fetchPreview = (item, context, size, options) =>
            {
                return CreateTextureFromColor(item.id, (int)size.x, (int)size.y);
            },
        };
    }
