## Declaration

public void Gather(Func<ITerrainInfo,Texture> terrainSource,
[Color](Color.html) defaultColor, [Material](Material.html) blitMaterial, int
blitPass, Action<ITerrainInfo> beforeBlit, Action<ITerrainInfo> afterBlit);

### Parameters

terrainSource | A function that returns the Texture data to collect from each Terrain.  
---|---  
defaultColor | The default color for `sourceRenderTexture`.  
blitMaterial | The material used to copy the data. If null, the default blit material is used.  
blitPass | The material pass used to copy the data.  
beforeBlit | An optional action to call before copying from each Terrain. The default is null.  
afterBlit | An optional action to call after copying from each Terrain. The default is null.  
  
### Description

Gathers user-specified Texture data into `sourceRenderTexture`.

This function collects Texture data from all Terrain tiles in the
PaintContext, and merges that data into `sourceRenderTexture`. The
`terrainSource` function specifies what data to collect from each Terrain.
Gather assumes that the Texture data, which `terrainSource` returns, is mapped
over the Terrain tile in a manner similar to the Heightmap and Alphamaps.  
  
First, the function clears `sourceRenderTexture` to `defaultColor`.  
Then, it uses the following steps to gather each Terrain in the PaintContext:  
1) Calls `terrainSource` to retrieve the Texture.  
2) Calls `beforeBlit`.  
3) Uses `blitMaterial` and `blitPass` to copy The Texture into
`sourceRenderTexture`.  
4) Calls `afterBlit`.
