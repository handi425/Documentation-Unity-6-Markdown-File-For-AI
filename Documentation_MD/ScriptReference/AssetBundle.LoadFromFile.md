## Declaration

public static [AssetBundle](AssetBundle.html) LoadFromFile(string path);

## Declaration

public static [AssetBundle](AssetBundle.html) LoadFromFile(string path, uint
crc);

## Declaration

public static [AssetBundle](AssetBundle.html) LoadFromFile(string path, uint
crc, ulong offset);

### Parameters

path | Path of the file on disk.  
---|---  
crc | An optional CRC-32 checksum of the uncompressed content. If this is non-zero, then the content will be compared against the checksum before loading it, and give an error if it does not match.  
offset | An optional byte offset. This value specifies where to start reading the AssetBundle from.  
  
### Returns

**AssetBundle** Loaded AssetBundle object or null if failed.

### Description

Synchronously loads an AssetBundle from a file on disk.

The function supports bundles of any compression type. In case of **LZMA**
compression, the file content will be fully decompressed into memory and
loaded from there. See [AssetBundles compression](../Manual/AssetBundles-
Cache.html) for more details.  
  
Compared to [LoadFromFileAsync](AssetBundle.LoadFromFileAsync.html), this
version is synchronous and will not return until it is done creating the
AssetBundle object.  
  
This is the fastest way to load an AssetBundle.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;
    using System.IO;  
      
    public class LoadFromFileExample : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            var myLoadedAssetBundle = [AssetBundle.LoadFromFile](AssetBundle.LoadFromFile.html)(Path.Combine([Application.streamingAssetsPath](Application-streamingAssetsPath.html), "myassetBundle"));
            if (myLoadedAssetBundle == null)
            {
                [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("Failed to load [AssetBundle](AssetBundle.html)!");
                return;
            }  
      
            var prefab = myLoadedAssetBundle.LoadAsset<[GameObject](GameObject.html)>("MyObject");
            Instantiate(prefab);  
      
            myLoadedAssetBundle.Unload(false);
        }
    }
