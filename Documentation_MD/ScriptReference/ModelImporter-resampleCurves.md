public bool resampleCurves;

### Description

If set to false, the importer will not resample curves when possible. Read
more about [animation curve
resampling](../Manual/AnimationEulerCurveImport.html).  
  
Notes:  
  
\- Some unsupported FBX features (such as PreRotation or PostRotation on
transforms) will override this setting. In these situations, animation curves
will still be resampled even if the setting is disabled. For best results,
avoid using PreRotation, PostRotation and GetRotationPivot.  
  
\- This option was introduced in Version 5.3. Prior to this version, Unity's
import behaviour was as if this option was always enabled. Therefore enabling
the option gives the same behaviour as pre-5.3 animation import.
