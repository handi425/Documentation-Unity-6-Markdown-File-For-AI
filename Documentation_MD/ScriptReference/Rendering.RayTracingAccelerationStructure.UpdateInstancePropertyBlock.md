[Material](Material.html) shared with other similar ray tracing instances.  
  
Additional per ray tracing instance Material properties can be specified using
the [MaterialPropertyBlock](MaterialPropertyBlock.html) argument. The
properties are copied into the ray tracing instance when this function is
called.
