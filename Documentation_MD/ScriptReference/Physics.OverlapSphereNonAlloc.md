## Declaration

public static int OverlapSphereNonAlloc([Vector3](Vector3.html) position,
float radius, Collider[] results, int layerMask = AllLayers,
[QueryTriggerInteraction](QueryTriggerInteraction.html)
queryTriggerInteraction = QueryTriggerInteraction.UseGlobal);

### Parameters

position | Center of the sphere.  
---|---  
radius | Radius of the sphere.  
results | The buffer to store the results into.  
layerMask | A [Layer mask](../Manual/Layers.html) defines which layers of colliders to include in the query.  
queryTriggerInteraction | Specifies whether this query should hit Triggers.  
  
### Returns

**int** Returns the amount of colliders stored into the `results` buffer.

### Description

Computes and stores colliders touching or inside the sphere into the provided
buffer.

Does not attempt to grow the buffer if it runs out of space. The length of the
buffer is returned when the buffer is full. Like
[Physics.OverlapSphere](Physics.OverlapSphere.html), but generates no garbage.

    {
        void ExplosionDamage([Vector3](Vector3.html) center, float radius)
        {
            int maxColliders = 10;
            [Collider](Collider.html)[] hitColliders = new [Collider](Collider.html)[maxColliders];
            int numColliders = [Physics.OverlapSphereNonAlloc](Physics.OverlapSphereNonAlloc.html)(center, radius, hitColliders);
            for (int i = 0; i < numColliders; i++)
            {
                hitColliders[i].SendMessage("AddDamage");
            }
        }
    }
