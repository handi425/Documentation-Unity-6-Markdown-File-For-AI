**Obsolete** Use EditorApplication.hierarchyChanged. public static
[EditorApplication.CallbackFunction](EditorApplication.CallbackFunction.html)
hierarchyWindowChanged;

### Description

A callback to be raised when an object in the hierarchy changes.  
  
Each time an object is (or a group of objects are) created, renamed, parented,
unparented or destroyed this callback is raised.  

Additional resources:
[EditorWindow.OnHierarchyChange](EditorWindow.OnHierarchyChange.html).

    
    
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class ExampleCode
    {
        [[MenuItem](MenuItem.html)("Example/[Hierarchy](Unity.Hierarchy.Hierarchy.html) Window Changed")]
        static void Example()
        {
            EditorApplication.hierarchyWindowChanged += ExampleCallback;
        }  
      
        static void ExampleCallback()
        {
            Object[] all = [Resources.FindObjectsOfTypeAll](Resources.FindObjectsOfTypeAll.html)(typeof(Object));
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("There are " + all.Length + " objects at the moment.");
        }
    }
    

**Note:** Changing the HideFlags on an object will also cause this callback to
be called.
