## Declaration

public void Clear();

### Description

Clears all the vertices and shapes from the PhysicsShapeGroup.

This call clears the lists used to store both vertices and shapes but retains
the current shape group capacity (effectively creating an empty shape group).

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.Assertions;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            // Create a shape group.
            var shapeGroup = new [PhysicsShapeGroup2D](PhysicsShapeGroup2D.html)();  
      
            // Add a Circle to the shape group.
            shapeGroup.AddCircle
                (
                    center: [Vector2.zero](Vector2-zero.html),
                    radius: 1f
                );  
      
            // Add a [Box](UIElements.Box.html) to the shape group.
            shapeGroup.AddBox
                (
                    center: new [Vector2](Vector2.html)(3f, 2f),
                    size: new [Vector2](Vector2.html)(1f, 1f)
                );  
      
            // Validate the contents.
            [Assert.AreEqual](Assertions.Assert.AreEqual.html)(1 + 1, shapeGroup.shapeCount);
            [Assert.AreEqual](Assertions.Assert.AreEqual.html)(1 + 4, shapeGroup.vertexCount);
            [Assert.AreEqual](Assertions.Assert.AreEqual.html)([PhysicsShapeType2D.Circle](PhysicsShapeType2D.Circle.html), shapeGroup.GetShape(0).shapeType);
            [Assert.AreEqual](Assertions.Assert.AreEqual.html)([PhysicsShapeType2D.Polygon](PhysicsShapeType2D.Polygon.html), shapeGroup.GetShape(1).shapeType);  
      
            // Clear the shape group.
            shapeGroup.Clear();  
      
            // Validate the contents.
            [Assert.AreEqual](Assertions.Assert.AreEqual.html)(0, shapeGroup.shapeCount);
            [Assert.AreEqual](Assertions.Assert.AreEqual.html)(0, shapeGroup.vertexCount);
        }
    }
