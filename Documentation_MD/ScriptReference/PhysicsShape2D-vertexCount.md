public int vertexCount;

### Description

The total number of vertices used to represent the [shape
type](PhysicsShape2D-shapeType.html).

See [PhysicsShapeType2D](PhysicsShapeType2D.html) for details on how each type
uses different quantities of vertices to represent itself.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.Assertions;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            // Create a shape group.
            var shapeGroup = new [PhysicsShapeGroup2D](PhysicsShapeGroup2D.html)();  
      
            // Add a Circle to the shape group.
            var circleShapeIndex = shapeGroup.AddCircle
                (
                    center: new [Vector2](Vector2.html)(-2f, 3f),
                    radius: 1f
                );  
      
            // Add a Capsule to the shape group.
            var capsuleShapeIndex = shapeGroup.AddCapsule
                (
                    vertex0: [Vector2.down](Vector2-down.html),
                    vertex1: [Vector2.up](Vector2-up.html),
                    radius: 0.5f
                );  
      
            // Fetch the shapes.
            var circleShape = shapeGroup.GetShape(circleShapeIndex);
            var capsuleShape = shapeGroup.GetShape(capsuleShapeIndex);  
      
            // Validate the shape vertex count.
            [Assert.AreEqual](Assertions.Assert.AreEqual.html)(1, circleShape.vertexCount);
            [Assert.AreEqual](Assertions.Assert.AreEqual.html)(2, capsuleShape.vertexCount);
