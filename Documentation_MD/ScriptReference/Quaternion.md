### Description

Quaternions are used to represent rotations.

A quaternion is a four-tuple of real numbers {x,y,z,w}. A quaternion is a
mathematically convenient alternative to the euler angle representation. You
can interpolate a quaternion without experiencing gimbal lock. You can also
use a quaternion to concatenate a series of rotations into a single
representation.  
  
Unity internally uses Quaternions to represent all rotations.  
  
In most cases, you can use existing rotations from methods such as
[Transform.localRotation](Transform-localRotation.html) or
[Transform.rotation](Transform-rotation.html) to construct new rotations. For
example, use existing rotations to smoothly interpolate between two rotations.
The most used Quaternion functions are as follows:
[Quaternion.LookRotation](Quaternion.LookRotation.html),
[Quaternion.Angle](Quaternion.Angle.html),
[Quaternion.Euler](Quaternion.Euler.html),
[Quaternion.Slerp](Quaternion.Slerp.html),
[Quaternion.FromToRotation](Quaternion.FromToRotation.html), and
[Quaternion.identity](Quaternion-identity.html).  
  
You can use the Quaternion.operator * to rotate one rotation by another, or to
rotate a vector by a rotation.  
  
Note that Unity expects Quaternions to be normalized.

### Static Properties

[identity](Quaternion-identity.html)| The identity rotation (Read Only).  
---|---  
  
### Properties

[eulerAngles](Quaternion-eulerAngles.html)| Returns or sets the euler angle
representation of the rotation in degrees.  
---|---  
[normalized](Quaternion-normalized.html)| Returns this quaternion with a
magnitude of 1 (Read Only).  
[this[int]](Quaternion.Index_operator.html)| Access the x, y, z, w components
using [0], [1], [2], [3] respectively.  
[w](Quaternion-w.html)| W component of the Quaternion. Do not directly modify
quaternions.  
[x](Quaternion-x.html)| X component of the Quaternion. Don't modify this
directly unless you know quaternions inside out.  
[y](Quaternion-y.html)| Y component of the Quaternion. Don't modify this
directly unless you know quaternions inside out.  
[z](Quaternion-z.html)| Z component of the Quaternion. Don't modify this
directly unless you know quaternions inside out.  
  
### Constructors

[Quaternion](Quaternion-ctor.html)| Constructs new Quaternion with given
x,y,z,w components.  
---|---  
  
### Public Methods

[Set](Quaternion.Set.html)| Set x, y, z and w components of an existing
Quaternion.  
---|---  
[SetFromToRotation](Quaternion.SetFromToRotation.html)| Creates a rotation
which rotates from fromDirection to toDirection.  
[SetLookRotation](Quaternion.SetLookRotation.html)| Creates a rotation with
the specified forward and upwards directions.  
[ToAngleAxis](Quaternion.ToAngleAxis.html)| Converts a rotation to angle-axis
representation (angles in degrees).  
[ToString](Quaternion.ToString.html)| Returns a formatted string for this
quaternion.  
  
### Static Methods

[Angle](Quaternion.Angle.html)| Returns the angle in degrees between two
rotations a and b. The resulting angle ranges from 0 to 180.  
---|---  
[AngleAxis](Quaternion.AngleAxis.html)| Creates a rotation which rotates angle
degrees around axis.  
[Dot](Quaternion.Dot.html)| The dot product between two rotations.  
[Euler](Quaternion.Euler.html)| Returns a rotation that rotates z degrees
around the z axis, x degrees around the x axis, and y degrees around the y
axis; applied in that order.  
[FromToRotation](Quaternion.FromToRotation.html)| Creates a rotation from
fromDirection to toDirection.  
[Inverse](Quaternion.Inverse.html)| Returns the Inverse of rotation.  
[Lerp](Quaternion.Lerp.html)| Interpolates between a and b by t and normalizes
the result afterwards.  
[LerpUnclamped](Quaternion.LerpUnclamped.html)| Interpolates between a and b
by t and normalizes the result afterwards. The parameter t is not clamped.  
[LookRotation](Quaternion.LookRotation.html)| Creates a rotation with the
specified forward and upwards directions.  
[Normalize](Quaternion.Normalize.html)| Converts this quaternion to a
quaternion with the same orientation but with a magnitude of 1.0.  
[RotateTowards](Quaternion.RotateTowards.html)| Rotates a rotation from
towards to.  
[Slerp](Quaternion.Slerp.html)| Spherically linear interpolates between unit
quaternions a and b by a ratio of t.  
[SlerpUnclamped](Quaternion.SlerpUnclamped.html)| Spherically linear
interpolates between unit quaternions a and b by t.

[operator ==](Quaternion-operator_eq.html)| Are two quaternions equal to each
other?
