[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-Mesh.html "Go to Mesh Component in the
Manual")

public int subMeshCount;

### Description

The number of sub-meshes inside the Mesh object.

Each sub-mesh corresponds to a [Material](Material.html) in a
[Renderer](Renderer.html), such as [MeshRenderer](MeshRenderer.html) or
[SkinnedMeshRenderer](SkinnedMeshRenderer.html). A sub-mesh consists of a list
of triangles, which refer to a set of vertices. Vertices can be shared between
multiple sub-meshes.  
  
Additional resources: [GetTriangles](Mesh.GetTriangles.html),
[SetTriangles](Mesh.SetTriangles.html).

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            [Mesh](Mesh.html) mesh = GetComponent<[MeshFilter](MeshFilter.html)>().mesh;
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("Submeshes: " + mesh.subMeshCount);
        }
    }
    

For advanced lower-level sub-mesh and mesh data manipulation functions, see
[SubMeshDescriptor](Rendering.SubMeshDescriptor.html),
[SetSubMesh](Mesh.SetSubMesh.html),
[SetIndexBufferParams](Mesh.SetIndexBufferParams.html),
[SetIndexBufferData](Mesh.SetIndexBufferData.html).  
  
Note that changing `subMeshCount` to a smaller value than it was previously
resizes the Mesh index buffer to be smaller. The new index buffer size is set
to [SubMeshDescriptor.indexStart](Rendering.SubMeshDescriptor-indexStart.html)
of the first removed sub-mesh.
