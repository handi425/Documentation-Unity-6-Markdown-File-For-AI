### Description

Representation of 2D vectors and points.

This structure is used in some places to represent 2D positions and vectors
(e.g. texture coordinates in a [Mesh](Mesh.html) or texture offsets in
[Material](Material.html)). In the majority of other cases a Vector3 is used.

### Static Properties

[down](Vector2-down.html)| Shorthand for writing Vector2(0, -1).  
---|---  
[left](Vector2-left.html)| Shorthand for writing Vector2(-1, 0).  
[negativeInfinity](Vector2-negativeInfinity.html)| Shorthand for writing
Vector2(float.NegativeInfinity, float.NegativeInfinity).  
[one](Vector2-one.html)| Shorthand for writing Vector2(1, 1).  
[positiveInfinity](Vector2-positiveInfinity.html)| Shorthand for writing
Vector2(float.PositiveInfinity, float.PositiveInfinity).  
[right](Vector2-right.html)| Shorthand for writing Vector2(1, 0).  
[up](Vector2-up.html)| Shorthand for writing Vector2(0, 1).  
[zero](Vector2-zero.html)| Shorthand for writing Vector2(0, 0).  
  
### Properties

[magnitude](Vector2-magnitude.html)| Returns the length of this vector (Read
Only).  
---|---  
[normalized](Vector2-normalized.html)| Returns a normalized vector based on
the current vector. The normalized vector has a magnitude of 1 and is in the
same direction as the current vector. Returns a zero vector If the current
vector is too small to be normalized.  
[sqrMagnitude](Vector2-sqrMagnitude.html)| Returns the squared length of this
vector (Read Only).  
[this[int]](Vector2.Index_operator.html)| Access the x or y component using
[0] or [1] respectively.  
[x](Vector2-x.html)| X component of the vector.  
[y](Vector2-y.html)| Y component of the vector.  
  
### Constructors

[Vector2](Vector2-ctor.html)| Constructs a new vector with given x, y
components.  
---|---  
  
### Public Methods

[Equals](Vector2.Equals.html)| Returns true if the given vector is exactly
equal to this vector.  
---|---  
[Normalize](Vector2.Normalize.html)| Makes this vector have a magnitude of 1.  
[Set](Vector2.Set.html)| Set x and y components of an existing Vector2.  
[ToString](Vector2.ToString.html)| Returns a formatted string for this vector.  
  
### Static Methods

[Angle](Vector2.Angle.html)| Gets the unsigned angle in degrees between from
and to.  
---|---  
[ClampMagnitude](Vector2.ClampMagnitude.html)| Returns a copy of vector with
its magnitude clamped to maxLength.  
[Distance](Vector2.Distance.html)| Returns the distance between a and b.  
[Dot](Vector2.Dot.html)| Dot Product of two vectors.  
[Lerp](Vector2.Lerp.html)| Linearly interpolates between vectors a and b by t.  
[LerpUnclamped](Vector2.LerpUnclamped.html)| Linearly interpolates between
vectors a and b by t.  
[Max](Vector2.Max.html)| Returns a vector that is made from the largest
components of two vectors.  
[Min](Vector2.Min.html)| Returns a vector that is made from the smallest
components of two vectors.  
[MoveTowards](Vector2.MoveTowards.html)| Moves a point current towards target.  
[Perpendicular](Vector2.Perpendicular.html)| Returns the 2D vector
perpendicular to this 2D vector. The result is always rotated 90-degrees in a
counter-clockwise direction for a 2D coordinate system where the positive Y
axis goes up.  
[Reflect](Vector2.Reflect.html)| Reflects a vector off the surface defined by
a normal.  
[Scale](Vector2.Scale.html)| Multiplies two vectors component-wise.  
[SignedAngle](Vector2.SignedAngle.html)| Gets the signed angle in degrees
between from and to.  
[SmoothDamp](Vector2.SmoothDamp.html)| Gradually changes a vector towards a
desired goal over time.  
  
### Operators

[operator -](Vector2-operator_subtract.html)| Subtracts one vector from
another.  
---|---  
[operator *](Vector2-operator_multiply.html)| Multiplies a vector by a number.  
[operator /](Vector2-operator_divide.html)| Divides a vector by a number.  
[operator +](Vector2-operator_add.html)| Adds two vectors.  
[operator ==](Vector2-operator_eq.html)| Returns true if two vectors are
approximately equal.  
[Vector2](Vector2-operator_Vector3.html)| Converts a Vector3 to a Vector2.  
[Vector3](Vector2-operator_Vector2.html)| Converts a Vector2 to a Vector3.
