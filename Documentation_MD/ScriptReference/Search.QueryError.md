### Description

A QueryError holds the definition of a query parsing error.

QueryErrors are obtained when parsing a query through the function
[QueryEngine.Parse](Search.QueryEngine_1.Parse.html). See
[QueryEngine](Search.QueryEngine_1.html) for an example where we recover
parsing errors when a query is invalid.

### Properties

[index](Search.QueryError-index.html)| Index where the error happened.  
---|---  
[length](Search.QueryError-length.html)| Length of the block that was being
parsed.  
[reason](Search.QueryError-reason.html)| Reason why the parsing failed.  
  
### Constructors

[QueryError](Search.QueryError-ctor.html)| Construct a new QueryError.
