### Description

Generates more information in the BuildReport.

The BuildReport object returned by BuildPipeline.BuildPlayer will contain more
details (about build times and contents), at the cost of a slightly
(typically, a few percents) longer build time.  
  
The following script example illustrates how to use
[DetailedBuildReport](BuildOptions.DetailedBuildReport.html) when building a
player. Create a project and add the script under Assets/Editor.

    
    
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class DetailedBuildReportExample : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        [[MenuItem](MenuItem.html)("Build/DetailedBuildReport example")]
        public static void MyBuild()
        {
            [BuildPlayerOptions](BuildPlayerOptions.html) buildPlayerOptions = new [BuildPlayerOptions](BuildPlayerOptions.html)();
            buildPlayerOptions.scenes = new[] { "Assets/scene.unity" };
            buildPlayerOptions.locationPathName = "DetailedReportBuild/MyGame.exe";
            buildPlayerOptions.target = [BuildTarget.StandaloneWindows64](BuildTarget.StandaloneWindows64.html);  
      
            buildPlayerOptions.options = [BuildOptions.DetailedBuildReport](BuildOptions.DetailedBuildReport.html);  
      
            var buildReport = [BuildPipeline.BuildPlayer](BuildPipeline.BuildPlayer.html)(buildPlayerOptions);
        }
    }
    

Now run the "Build/DetailedBuildReport example" scripts example.  
You can now get more information about the build process in the variable
"buildReport", that you can process using the
[BuildReport](Build.Reporting.BuildReport.html) API.  
You can find illustrations of how to query the
[BuildReport](Build.Reporting.BuildReport.html) API by looking at the [Build
Report Inspector source script ](https://github.com/Unity-
Technologies/BuildReportInspector).
