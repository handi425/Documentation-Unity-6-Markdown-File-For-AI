public string managedReferenceFullTypename;

### Description

String corresponding to the value of the managed reference object (dynamic)
full type string.

Contains a valid value when [propertyType](SerializedProperty-
propertyType.html) is
[SerializedPropertyType.ManagedReference](SerializedPropertyType.ManagedReference.html).
This property is Read Only (you cannot write to it).  
  
  
  
The full type name string returned has the following format: "[assembly-name]
[namespace.][parent-class-names][classname]" where:  
\- `[assembly-name]` is the name of the assembly that contains the target type  
\- `[namespace.]` is an optional (if empty) namespace followed by a '.'  
\- `[parent-class-names]` is a '/' separated list of optional parent class
names (in the case of nested class definitions)  
\- `[classname]` is the actual dynamic type name of the managed object class.  
  
  
  
'null' references return an empty type string.
