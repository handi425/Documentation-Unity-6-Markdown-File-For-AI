[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-GameObject.html "Go to GameObject Component
in the Manual")

public int layer;

### Description

Integer identifying the layer the GameObject is assigned to.

This is the standard integer value which identifies the layer, not the
[LayerMask](LayerMask.html). You can use layers for selective rendering from
cameras or to ignore Raycasts. Unity generates 32 layers, identified by
standard integers from 0 to 31, and reserves some layers for its own systems.
Refer to [ Create functional layers in Unity](../Manual/create-layers.html)
for a list of predefined layers and how to create your own new ones.  
  
To convert this `layer` identifier to a [LayerMask](LayerMask.html), refer to
[ Set a layerMask](../Manual/layermask-set.html). To obtain the `string` name
of the layer from this `layer` identifier, use
[LayerMask.LayerToName](LayerMask.LayerToName.html). Refer to
[Layers](../Manual/Layers.html) in the Manual for a comprehensive guide to
using layers.

    
    
    // Put the [GameObject](GameObject.html) in the ignore raycast layer (2)  
      
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    [[ExecuteInEditMode](ExecuteInEditMode.html)]
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Awake()
        {
            //gameObject.layer uses only integers, but we can turn a layer name into a layer integer using [LayerMask.NameToLayer](LayerMask.NameToLayer.html)()
            int LayerIgnoreRaycast = [LayerMask.NameToLayer](LayerMask.NameToLayer.html)("Ignore Raycast");
            gameObject.layer = LayerIgnoreRaycast;
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("Current layer: " + gameObject.layer);
        }
    }
