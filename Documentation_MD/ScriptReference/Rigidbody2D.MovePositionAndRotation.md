## Declaration

public void MovePositionAndRotation([Vector2](Vector2.html) position, float
angle);

### Parameters

position | The position to move the rigidbody to.  
---|---  
angle | The angle to move the rigidbody to.  
  
### Description

Moves the rigidbody position to `position` and the rigidbody angle to `angle`.

This is a combination of calling both
[MovePosition](Rigidbody2D.MovePosition.html) and
[MoveRotation](Rigidbody2D.MoveRotation.html). This can be used to increase
performance by not having to perform two separate calls to queue movements.  
  
For more details on the operation of movement using these methods, refer to
[Rigidbody2D.MovePosition](Rigidbody2D.MovePosition.html) and
[Rigidbody2D.MoveRotation](Rigidbody2D.MoveRotation.html).

## Declaration

public void MovePositionAndRotation([Vector2](Vector2.html) position,
[Quaternion](Quaternion.html) rotation);

### Parameters

position | The position to move the rigidbody to.  
---|---  
rotation | The rotation to move the rigidbody to. Only the Z-Axis rotation is used from the full 3D Quaternion rotation.  
  
### Description

Moves the rigidbody position to `position` and the rigidbody angle to
`rotation`.

This is a combination of calling both
[MovePosition](Rigidbody2D.MovePosition.html) and
[MoveRotation](Rigidbody2D.MoveRotation.html). This can be used to increase
performance by not having to perform two separate calls to queue movements.  
  
For more details on the operation of movement using these methods, refer to
[Rigidbody2D.MovePosition](Rigidbody2D.MovePosition.html) and
[Rigidbody2D.MoveRotation](Rigidbody2D.MoveRotation.html).
