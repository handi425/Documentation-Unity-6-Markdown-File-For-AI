## Declaration

protected float GetCustomRowHeight(int row,
[IMGUI.Controls.TreeViewItem](IMGUI.Controls.TreeViewItem.html) item);

### Parameters

row | Row index.  
---|---  
item | Item for given row.  
  
### Returns

**float** Height of row.

### Description

Override to control individual row heights.

Override this method if custom row rects are needed for each row in the
TreeView, for example if you have content that can vary in height depending on
the content. This method is called internally by the TreeView for each row
after BuildRows have been called. If this method is not overridden then the
`rowHeight` property is used for all rows.  
  
This method should only be overridden if row heights can differ; if all rows
have same height then use the `rowHeight` property as this is more performant
for large data sets.  
  
The heights returned by this method are cached. To update the cache call
[RefreshCustomRowHeights](IMGUI.Controls.TreeView.RefreshCustomRowHeights.html).
