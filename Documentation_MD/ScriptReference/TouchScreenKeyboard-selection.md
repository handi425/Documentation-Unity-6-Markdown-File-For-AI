public [RangeInt](RangeInt.html) selection;

### Description

Gets or sets the character range of the selected text within the string
currently being edited.

For example: if the keyboard is editing a [text](TouchScreenKeyboard-
text.html) "abcdef" and the "cde" substring is selected, the return value is a
[RangeInt](RangeInt.html) with the [RangeInt.start](RangeInt-start.html) value
set to 2 and a [RangeInt.length](RangeInt-length.html) value of 3. Similarly,
setting selection to a [RangeInt](RangeInt.html) with the
[RangeInt.start](RangeInt-start.html) value set to 2 and a
[RangeInt.length](RangeInt-length.html) value of 3 will select "cde" of the
string "abcdef".  
  
If the caret is between two characters and no text is selected, then the
[RangeInt.length](RangeInt-length.html) property is 0.  
  
This always returns an empty range (start 0, length 0) if
[canGetSelection](TouchScreenKeyboard-canGetSelection.html) is false.
