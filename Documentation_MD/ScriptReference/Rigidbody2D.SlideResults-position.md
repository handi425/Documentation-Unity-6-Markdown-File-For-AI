public [Vector2](Vector2.html) position;

### Description

The position that was calculate as a target position to move to when
performing a [Rigidbody2D.Slide](Rigidbody2D.Slide.html).

When a [Rigidbody2D.Slide](Rigidbody2D.Slide.html) command is complete, this
will be the position that both the
[Rigidbody2D.position](Rigidbody2D-position.html) and
[Transform.position](Transform-position.html) are set to however, if
[Rigidbody2D.SlideMovement.useSimulationMove](Rigidbody2D.SlideMovement-
useSimulationMove.html) is enabled, then neither the
[Rigidbody2D.position](Rigidbody2D-position.html) and
[Transform.position](Transform-position.html) will be changd upon return but a
[Rigidbody2D.MovePosition](Rigidbody2D.MovePosition.html) would have been
called using this position. If
[Rigidbody2D.SlideMovement.useNoMove](Rigidbody2D.SlideMovement-
useNoMove.html) is enabled then no move is processed at all but is simply
returned here.
