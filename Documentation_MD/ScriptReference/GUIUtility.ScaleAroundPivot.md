    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        private [Vector2](Vector2.html) scale = new [Vector2](Vector2.html)(1, 1);
        private [Vector2](Vector2.html) pivotPoint;  
      
        void OnGUI()
        {
            pivotPoint = new [Vector2](Vector2.html)([Screen.width](Screen-width.html) / 2, [Screen.height](Screen-height.html) / 2);
            [GUIUtility.ScaleAroundPivot](GUIUtility.ScaleAroundPivot.html)(scale, pivotPoint);  
      
            if ([GUI.Button](GUI.Button.html)(new [Rect](Rect.html)([Screen.width](Screen-width.html) / 2 - 25, [Screen.height](Screen-height.html) / 2 - 25, 50, 50), "Big!"))
            {
                scale += new [Vector2](Vector2.html)(0.5F, 0.5F);
            }
