## Declaration

public static void InstantiateGameObjects(int sourceInstanceID, int count,
NativeArray<int> newInstanceIDs, NativeArray<int> newTransformInstanceIDs,
[SceneManagement.Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html) destinationScene);

### Parameters

sourceInstanceID | The instance ID of the GameObject to create additional instances of.  
---|---  
count | The number of instances of the GameObject to create.  
newInstanceIDs | Pre-allocated NativeArray to populate with the instance IDs of the new GameObjects. Must be the same size as `count`.  
newTransformInstanceIDs | Pre-allocated NativeArray to populate with the instance IDs of the Transforms of the new GameObjects. Must be the same size as `count`.  
destinationScene | The Scene to place the instantiated GameObjects into. If default, then the GameObjects will be added to the currently active Scene.  
  
### Description

Creates a specified number of instances of a GameObject identified by its
instance ID and populates NativeArrays with the instance IDs of the new
GameObjects and their Transform components.

Use `InstantiateGameObjects` to instantiate multiple GameObjects as a batch.
An instance ID can be resolved to an object using
[Resources.InstanceIDToObject](Resources.InstanceIDToObject.html).

    
    
    using [System](Rendering.VirtualTexturing.System.html);
    using Unity.Collections;
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class InstantiateInstanceID : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
    public [GameObject](GameObject.html) prefab;
    public int count = 100;  
      
        int m_InstanceID;
        NativeArray<int> m_InstanceIds;
        NativeArray<int> m_TransformIds;
        
        void Start()
        {
            m_InstanceID = prefab.GetInstanceID();
            m_InstanceIds = new NativeArray<int>(count, [Allocator.Persistent](Unity.Collections.Allocator.Persistent.html));
            m_TransformIds = new NativeArray<int>(count, [Allocator.Persistent](Unity.Collections.Allocator.Persistent.html));
            
            [GameObject.InstantiateGameObjects](GameObject.InstantiateGameObjects.html)(m_InstanceID, count, m_InstanceIds,m_TransformIds );
        }  
      
        void OnDestroy()
        {
            m_InstanceIds.Dispose();
            m_TransformIds.Dispose();
        }
    }
