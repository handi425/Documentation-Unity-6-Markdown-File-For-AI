### Description

Representation of 3D vectors and points.

This structure is used throughout Unity to pass 3D positions and directions
around. It also contains functions for doing common vector operations.  
  
Besides the functions listed below, other classes can be used to manipulate
vectors and points as well. For example the [Quaternion](Quaternion.html) and
the [Matrix4x4](Matrix4x4.html) classes are useful for rotating or
transforming vectors and points.

### Static Properties

---|---  
[down](Vector3-down.html)| Shorthand for writing Vector3(0, -1, 0).  
[forward](Vector3-forward.html)| Shorthand for writing Vector3(0, 0, 1).  
[left](Vector3-left.html)| Shorthand for writing Vector3(-1, 0, 0).  
[negativeInfinity](Vector3-negativeInfinity.html)| Shorthand for writing
Vector3(float.NegativeInfinity, float.NegativeInfinity,
float.NegativeInfinity).  
[one](Vector3-one.html)| Shorthand for writing Vector3(1, 1, 1).  
[positiveInfinity](Vector3-positiveInfinity.html)| Shorthand for writing
Vector3(float.PositiveInfinity, float.PositiveInfinity,
float.PositiveInfinity).  
[right](Vector3-right.html)| Shorthand for writing Vector3(1, 0, 0).

components of two vectors.  
[Min](Vector3.Min.html)| Returns a vector that is made from the smallest
components of two vectors.  
[MoveTowards](Vector3.MoveTowards.html)| Calculate a position between the
points specified by current and target, moving no farther than the distance
specified by maxDistanceDelta.

[OrthoNormalize](Vector3.OrthoNormalize.html)| Makes vectors normalized and
orthogonal to each other.  
[Project](Vector3.Project.html)| Projects a vector onto another vector.  
[ProjectOnPlane](Vector3.ProjectOnPlane.html)| Projects a vector onto a plane.
