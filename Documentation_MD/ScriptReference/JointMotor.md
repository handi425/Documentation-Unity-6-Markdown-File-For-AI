### Description

The JointMotor is used to motorize a joint.

For example the [HingeJoint](HingeJoint.html) can be told to rotate at a given
speed and force. The joint will then attempt to reach the velocity with the
given maximum force.  
Additional resources: [HingeJoint](HingeJoint.html).

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            [HingeJoint](HingeJoint.html) hinge = GetComponent<[HingeJoint](HingeJoint.html)>();  
      
            // Make the hinge motor rotate with 90 degrees per second and a strong force.
            [JointMotor](JointMotor.html) motor = hinge.motor;
            motor.force = 100;
            motor.targetVelocity = 90;
            motor.freeSpin = false;
            hinge.motor = motor;
        }
    }
    

### Properties

[force](JointMotor-force.html)| The motor will apply a force.  
---|---  
[freeSpin](JointMotor-freeSpin.html)| If freeSpin is enabled the motor will
only accelerate but never slow down.  
[targetVelocity](JointMotor-targetVelocity.html)| The motor will apply a force
up to force to achieve targetVelocity.
