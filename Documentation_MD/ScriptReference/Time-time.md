public static float time;

### Description

The time at the beginning of the current frame in seconds since the start of
the application (Read Only).

This is the time in seconds since the start of the application, which
[Time.timeScale](Time-timeScale.html) scales and [Time.maximumDeltaTime](Time-
maximumDeltaTime.html) adjusts. When called from inside
[MonoBehaviour.FixedUpdate](MonoBehaviour.FixedUpdate.html), it returns
[Time.fixedTime](Time-fixedTime.html).  
  
This value is undefined during Awake messages and starts after all of these
messages are finished. This value does not update if the Editor is paused. See
[Time.realtimeSinceStartup](Time-realtimeSinceStartup.html) for a time value
that is unaffected by pausing.  
  
See [Time and Frame Rate Management](../Manual/managing-time-and-frame-
rate.html) in the User Manual for more information about how this property
relates to the other Time properties.

    
    
    //If the Fire1 button is pressed, a projectile
    //will be Instantiated every 0.5 seconds.  
      
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public [GameObject](GameObject.html) projectile;
        public float fireRate = 0.5f;
        private float nextFire = 0.0f;  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            if ([Input.GetButton](Input.GetButton.html)("Fire1") && [Time.time](Time-time.html) > nextFire)
            {
                nextFire = [Time.time](Time-time.html) + fireRate;
                Instantiate(projectile, transform.position, transform.rotation);
            }
        }
    }
