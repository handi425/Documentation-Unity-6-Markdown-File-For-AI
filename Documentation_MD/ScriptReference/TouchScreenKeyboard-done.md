**Obsolete** Property done is deprecated, use status instead. public bool
done;

### Description

Specifies if input process was finished. (Read Only)

Keyboard input process can be finished either by user tapping "Done" button or
script setting `active` property to false. Note that keyboard might be
temporarily inactive (either by sliding in/out due to orientation change or by
appearance of another keyboard), however its input process might still be not
finished and will be resumed automatically.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        // Opens a keyboard and shows what has been typed.  
      
        [TouchScreenKeyboard](TouchScreenKeyboard.html) keyboard;
        public string text = "";  
      
        void Start()
        {
            keyboard = [TouchScreenKeyboard.Open](TouchScreenKeyboard.Open.html)(text, [TouchScreenKeyboardType.Default](TouchScreenKeyboardType.Default.html));
        }  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            if (keyboard != null && keyboard.status == [TouchScreenKeyboard.Status.Done](TouchScreenKeyboard.Status.Done.html))
            {
                text = keyboard.text;
                print("User input is: " + text);
            }
        }
    }
