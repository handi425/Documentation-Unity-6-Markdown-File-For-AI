### Description

Unity raises this event when the Player is unloading.

Add an event handler to this event if you want to trigger events to
[Application.Unload](Application.Unload.html) calls. The event is raised after
a call to [Application.Unload](Application.Unload.html) is made, right before
the unloading starts.  
  
**Note:** The `Application.unloading` event is only supported on iOS, Android,
and Universal Windows Platform.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    // Unload Unity when the user clicks the button. Exit is not applied to the application.  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void OnGUI()
        {
            if ([GUI.Button](GUI.Button.html)(new [Rect](Rect.html)(10, 10, 200, 75), "Unload"))
                [Application.Unload](Application.Unload.html)();
        }  
      
        static void OnUnload()
        {
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("Unloading the Player");
        }  
      
        [RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethod]
        static void RunOnStart()
        {
            [Application.unloading](Application-unloading.html) += OnUnload;
        }
    }
