## Declaration

public [Vector3](Vector3.html) ScreenToWorldPoint([Vector3](Vector3.html)
position);

## Declaration

public [Vector3](Vector3.html) ScreenToWorldPoint([Vector3](Vector3.html)
position, [Camera.MonoOrStereoscopicEye](Camera.MonoOrStereoscopicEye.html)
eye);

### Parameters

position | A 2D screen space point in pixels, plus a z coordinate for the distance from the camera in world units. The lower left pixel of the screen is (0,0). The upper right pixel of the screen is (screen width in pixels - 1, screen height in pixels - 1).  
---|---  
eye | By default, [Camera.MonoOrStereoscopicEye.Mono](Camera.MonoOrStereoscopicEye.Mono.html). Can be set to [Camera.MonoOrStereoscopicEye.Left](Camera.MonoOrStereoscopicEye.Left.html) or [Camera.MonoOrStereoscopicEye.Right](Camera.MonoOrStereoscopicEye.Right.html) for use in stereoscopic rendering (e.g., for VR).  
  
### Returns

**Vector3** The world space point created by converting the screen space point
at the provided distance z from the camera plane.

### Description

Transforms a point from screen space into world space, where world space is
defined as the coordinate system at the very top of your game's hierarchy.

World space coordinates can still be calculated even when provided as an off-
screen coordinate, for example for instantiating an off-screen object near a
specific corner of the screen.  
  
To make sure the world space point is part of the camera's view volume, the z
coordinate you provide must be between the camera's `nearClipPlane` and
`farClipPlane`.

            [Vector2](Vector2.html) mousePos = new [Vector2](Vector2.html)();  
      
            // Get the mouse position from [Event](Event.html).
            // Note that the y position from [Event](Event.html) is inverted.
            mousePos.x = currentEvent.mousePosition.x;
            mousePos.y = cam.pixelHeight - currentEvent.mousePosition.y;  
      
            point = cam.ScreenToWorldPoint(new [Vector3](Vector3.html)(mousePos.x, mousePos.y, cam.nearClipPlane));
