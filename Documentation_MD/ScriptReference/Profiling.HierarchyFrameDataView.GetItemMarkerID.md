## Declaration

public int GetItemMarkerID(int id);

### Parameters

id | Hierarchy item identifier.  
---|---  
  
### Description

Returns Profiler marker which uniquely identifies sample name.

The Profiler uses unique identifier for each marker created during profiling
session. Marker can generate many samples which _HierarchyFrameDataView_
displays hierarchically as separate tree items (by default) or merged together
([HierarchyFrameDataView.ViewModes.MergeSamplesWithTheSameName](Profiling.HierarchyFrameDataView.ViewModes.MergeSamplesWithTheSameName.html))
in a single tree item.  
All samples generated by the same marker have the same integer marker
identifier and the same name.  
  
Marker identifiers are persistent for the entire profiling session.
