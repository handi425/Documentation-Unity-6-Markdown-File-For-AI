## Declaration

public static [Vector2](Vector2.html) MoveTowards([Vector2](Vector2.html)
current, [Vector2](Vector2.html) target, float maxDistanceDelta);

### Description

Moves a point `current` towards `target`.

This is essentially the same as [Vector2.Lerp](Vector2.Lerp.html) but instead
the function will ensure that the distance never exceeds `maxDistanceDelta`.
Negative values of `maxDistanceDelta` pushes the vector away from `target`.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    // 2D MoveTowards example
    // Move the sprite to where the mouse is clicked
    //
    // Set speed to -1.0f and the sprite will move
    // away from the mouse click position forever  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        private float speed = 10.0f;
        private [Vector2](Vector2.html) target;
        private [Vector2](Vector2.html) position;
        private [Camera](Camera.html) cam;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            target = new [Vector2](Vector2.html)(0.0f, 0.0f);
            position = gameObject.transform.position;  
      
            cam = [Camera.main](Camera-main.html);
        }  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            float step = speed * [Time.deltaTime](Time-deltaTime.html);  
      
            // move sprite towards the target location
            transform.position = [Vector2.MoveTowards](Vector2.MoveTowards.html)(transform.position, target, step);
        }  
      
        void OnGUI()
        {
            [Event](Event.html) currentEvent = [Event.current](Event-current.html);
            [Vector2](Vector2.html) mousePos = new [Vector2](Vector2.html)();
            [Vector2](Vector2.html) point = new [Vector2](Vector2.html)();  
      
            // compute where the mouse is in world space
            mousePos.x = currentEvent.mousePosition.x;
            mousePos.y = cam.pixelHeight - currentEvent.mousePosition.y;
            point = cam.ScreenToWorldPoint(new [Vector3](Vector3.html)(mousePos.x, mousePos.y, 0.0f));  
      
            if ([Input.GetMouseButtonDown](Input.GetMouseButtonDown.html)(0))
            {
                // set the target to the mouse click location
                target = point;
            }
        }
    }
