## Declaration

public static bool TryGetGPUTimeLastFrame(out float gpuTimeLastFrame);

### Parameters

gpuTimeLastFrame | Outputs the time spent by the GPU last frame.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**bool** True if the GPU time spent last frame is available, false otherwise.

### Description

Retrieves the time spent by the GPU last frame, in seconds, as reported by the
XR SDK.

On SDKs that support it, this method allows access to more accurate timing
information from the SDK itself. This information can take into account GPU
time spent in SDK-specific layers.  
  
Statistics are not always available and can vary based on hardware, SDK, and
even frame to frame. As such it is important to check the return value of this
method before using the statistic value from the out parameter.
