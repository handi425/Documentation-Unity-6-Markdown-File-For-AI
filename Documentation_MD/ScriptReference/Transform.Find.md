[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-Transform.html "Go to Transform Component
in the Manual")

## Declaration

public [Transform](Transform.html) Find(string n);

### Parameters

n | The search string, either the name of an immediate child or a hierarchy path for finding a descendent.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**Transform** The found child transform. Null if child with matching name
isn't found.

### Description

Finds a child by name `n` and returns it.

If no child with name `n` can be found, null is returned. If `n` contains a
'/' character it will access the Transform in the hierarchy like a path name.  
  
**Note:** [Find](Transform.Find.html) does not work properly if you have '/'
in the name of a GameObject.  
**Note:** [Find](Transform.Find.html) does not perform a recursive descend
down a Transform hierarchy.  
**Note:** [Find](Transform.Find.html) can find transform of disabled
GameObject.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public [GameObject](GameObject.html) player;
        public [Transform](Transform.html) gun;
        public [Transform](Transform.html) ammo;  
      
        //Invoked when a button is clicked.
        public void Example()
        {
            //Finds and assigns the child named "Gun".
            gun = player.transform.Find("Gun");  
      
            //If the child was found.
            if (gun != null)
            {
                //Find the child named "ammo" of the gameobject "magazine" (magazine is a child of "gun").
                ammo = gun.transform.Find("magazine/ammo");
            }
            else [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("No child with the name 'Gun' attached to the player");
        }
    }
    

As described [Find](Transform.Find.html) does not descend the
[Transform](Transform.html) hierarchy. [Find](Transform.Find.html) will only
search the given list of children looking for a named
[Transform](Transform.html). The following example shows the result of
[Find](Transform.Find.html) searching for GameObjects. The name of each
GameObject is used in the [Find](Transform.Find.html). This is why two
GameObjects in the same level of the hierarchy are found and reported.  
  
![](../StaticFiles/ScriptRefImages/TransformFind.png)  
_A GameObject with three children. Find() does not find the third child._

    
    
    // ExampleClass has a [GameObject](GameObject.html) with three spheres attached.
    // Two of these are children of the [GameObject](GameObject.html).  The third
    // transform, sphere3, is a child of sphere2.  Find() does
    // not find this child.  
      
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            [Transform](Transform.html) result;  
      
            for (int i = 1; i < 4; i++)
            {
                string sph;  
      
                sph = "sphere" + i.ToString();
                result = gameObject.transform.Find(sph);  
      
                if (result)
                {
                    [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("Found: " + sph);
                }
                else
                {
                    //Find() does not find sphere3
                    [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("Did not find: " + sph);  
      
                    //But we can access it with '/' character or by using GetChild()
                    [Transform](Transform.html) newresult;
                    newresult = gameObject.transform.Find("sphere2/sphere3");  
      
                    if (newresult)
                    {
                        [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("But now found:" + sph);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
