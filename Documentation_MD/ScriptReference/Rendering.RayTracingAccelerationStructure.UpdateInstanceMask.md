## Declaration

public void UpdateInstanceMask([Renderer](Renderer.html) renderer, uint mask);

### Parameters

---|---  
mask | The new mask.  
  
### Description

Updates the instance mask of a ray tracing instance.

## Declaration

public void UpdateInstanceMask(int handle, uint mask);

### Parameters

handle | The handle associated with an AABB or Mesh ray tracing instance.  
---|---  
mask | The new mask.  
  
### Description

Updates the instance mask of a ray tracing instance.

Pass along a new mask and the handle
[RayTracingAccelerationStructure.AddInstance](Rendering.RayTracingAccelerationStructure.AddInstance.html)
returns in order to update ray tracing mask associated with an axis-aligned
bounding box (AABB) [GraphicsBuffer](GraphicsBuffer.html) or a
[Mesh](Mesh.html).  
  
Ray tracing instances in the acceleration structure contain an 8-bit user
defined instance mask. The `TraceRay()` HLSL function has an 8-bit input
parameter, `InstanceInclusionMask` which gets ANDed with the instance mask
from any ray tracing instance that is a candidate for intersection during
acceleration structure traversal on the GPU. If the result of the AND
operation is zero, the GPU ignores the intersection.  
  
Note that building the acceleration structure on the GPU has to be triggered
by calling
[RayTracingAccelerationStructure.Build](Rendering.RayTracingAccelerationStructure.Build.html)
or
[CommandBuffer.BuildRayTracingAccelerationStructure](Rendering.CommandBuffer.BuildRayTracingAccelerationStructure.html).
