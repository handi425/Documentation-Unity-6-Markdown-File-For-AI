## Declaration

public int AddPolygon(List<Vector2> vertices);

### Parameters

vertices | A list of vertices that represent a continuous set of edges of a convex polygon with each vertex connecting to the following vertex to form each edge. The final vertex implicitly connects to the first vertex. The maximum allowed list length is defined by [Physics2D.MaxPolygonShapeVertices](Physics2D.MaxPolygonShapeVertices.html).  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**int** Returns the shape index the shape was added to in the
[PhysicsShapeGroup2D](PhysicsShapeGroup2D.html). This index is used as the
main reference when retrieving a shape.

### Description

Adds a polygon shape
([PhysicsShapeType2D.Polygon](PhysicsShapeType2D.Polygon.html)) to the shape
group.

A polygon shape is comprised of multiple edges (line segments) defined by all
the specified `vertices`.  
  
**NOTE** : A polygon forms a closed shape and does have an interior therefore
its interior is detectable by physics queries etc.
