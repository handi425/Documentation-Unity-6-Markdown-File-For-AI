Manual")

## Declaration

public uint GetBaseVertex(int submesh);

### Parameters

submesh | The sub-mesh index. See [subMeshCount](Mesh-subMeshCount.html).  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**uint** The offset applied to all vertex indices of this sub-mesh.

### Description

Gets the base vertex index of the given `sub-mesh`.

The base vertex can be used to achieve meshes that are larger than 65535
vertices while using 16 bit index buffers, as long as each sub-mesh fits
within its own 65535 vertex area. Alternatively, 32 bit index buffers can be
used via [indexFormat](Mesh-indexFormat.html).
