### Description

Interface for light probe post processing.

The interface provides common operations for light probes encoded as
[SphericalHarmonicsL2](Rendering.SphericalHarmonicsL2.html). Operations
include radiance to irradiance conversion, conversion to the format expected
by Unity for rendering (refer to
[IProbePostProcessor.ConvertToUnityFormat](LightTransport.PostProcessing.IProbePostProcessor.ConvertToUnityFormat.html)),
addition, and scaling.
