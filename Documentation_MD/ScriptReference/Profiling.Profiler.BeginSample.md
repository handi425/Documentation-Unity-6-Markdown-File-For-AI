## Declaration

public static void BeginSample(string name);

## Declaration

public static void BeginSample(string name, [Object](Object.html)
targetObject);

### Parameters

name | A string to identify the sample in the Profiler window.  
---|---  
targetObject | An object that provides context to the sample,.  
  
### Description

Begin profiling a piece of code with a custom label.

The Profiler displays the sample in the Hierarchy and Timeline views. The
sample is nested under the events or functional calls that lead to the
execution of the sampled code. For example, a sample placed in Update displays
under `Update.ScriptRunBehaviourUpdate` in the Profiler Hierarchy and Timeline
views. If you supply a `targetObject`, then you can click on the sample in the
Profiler Timeline to select that object in the Editor (when profiling from the
Editor Play mode).  
  
Profiler.BeginSample is conditionally compiled away using
ConditionalAttribute. Thus it will have zero overhead, when it is deployed in
non-Development Build.
