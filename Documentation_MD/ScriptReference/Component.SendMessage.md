## Declaration

public void SendMessage(string methodName, object value,
[SendMessageOptions](SendMessageOptions.html) options);

## Declaration

public void SendMessage(string methodName,
[SendMessageOptions](SendMessageOptions.html) options);

### Parameters

methodName | Name of the method to call.  
---|---  
value | Optional parameter for the method.  
options | Should an error be raised if the target object doesn't implement the method for the message?  
  
### Description

Calls the method named `methodName` on every
[MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html) in this game object.

The receiving method can choose to ignore the argument by having zero
arguments. If options is set to
[SendMessageOptions.RequireReceiver](SendMessageOptions.RequireReceiver.html)
an error is printed when the message is not picked up by any component.  
  
Note that messages will not be sent to inactive objects (ie, those that have
been deactivated in the editor or with the
[GameObject.SetActive](GameObject.SetActive.html) function).

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            /// Calls the function ApplyDamage with a value of 5
            SendMessage("ApplyDamage", 5.0);
        }  
      
        // Every script attached to the game object
        // that has a ApplyDamage function will be called.
        void ApplyDamage(float damage)
        {
            print(damage);
        }
    }
