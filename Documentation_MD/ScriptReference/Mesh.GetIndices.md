[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-Mesh.html "Go to Mesh Component in the
Manual")

## Declaration

public int[] GetIndices(int submesh, bool applyBaseVertex = true);

### Parameters

submesh | The sub-mesh index. See [subMeshCount](Mesh-subMeshCount.html).  
---|---  
applyBaseVertex | True (default value) will apply base vertex offset to returned indices.  
  
### Returns

**int[]** Array with face indices.

### Description

Fetches the index list for the specified sub-mesh.

Each integer in the returned list is a vertex index, which is used as an
offset into the Mesh's vertex arrays. See [vertices](Mesh-vertices.html) and
[GetVertices](Mesh.GetVertices.html). The layout of the indices depends on the
[MeshTopology](MeshTopology.html) of the sub-mesh. For example, a triangular
mesh will return indices in multiples of three.  
  
A sub-mesh represents a list of triangles (or indices with a different
[MeshTopology](MeshTopology.html)) that are rendered using a single
[Material](Material.html). When the Mesh is used with a
[Renderer](Renderer.html) that has multiple materials, you should ensure that
there is one sub-mesh per Material.  
  
Call the method overload with a `List` parameter if you control the life cycle
of the index buffer and wish to avoid allocation of a new array with every
access.

[GetTopology](Mesh.GetTopology.html), [MeshTopology](MeshTopology.html) enum,

## Declaration

public void GetIndices(List<int> indices, int submesh, bool applyBaseVertex =
true);

## Declaration

public void GetIndices(List<ushort> indices, int submesh, bool
applyBaseVertex);

### Parameters

indices | A list of indices to populate.  
---|---  
submesh | The sub-mesh index. See [subMeshCount](Mesh-subMeshCount.html).  
applyBaseVertex | True (default value) will apply base vertex offset to returned indices.  
  
### Description

Use this method overload if you control the life cycle of the list passed in
and you want to avoid allocating a new array with every access.
