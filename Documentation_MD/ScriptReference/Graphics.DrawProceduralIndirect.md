## Declaration

public static void DrawProceduralIndirect([Material](Material.html) material,

### Parameters

material |  [Material](Material.html) to use.  
---|---  
bounds | The bounding volume surrounding the instances you intend to draw.  
topology | Topology of the procedural geometry.  
camera | If `null` (default), the mesh will be drawn in all cameras. Otherwise it will be rendered in the given Camera only.  
bufferWithArgs | Buffer with draw arguments.  
argsOffset | Byte offset where in the buffer the draw arguments are.  
properties | Additional material properties to apply onto material just before this mesh will be drawn. See [MaterialPropertyBlock](MaterialPropertyBlock.html).  
castShadows | Determines whether the mesh can cast shadows.  
receiveShadows | Determines whether the mesh can receive shadows.  
layer |  [Layer](../Manual/Layers.html) to use.  
  
### Description

Draws procedural geometry on the GPU.

This function is now obsolete. For non-indexed rendering, use
RenderPrimitivesIndirect instead. For indexed rendering, use
RenderPrimitivesIndexedIndirect.  
  
This function only works on platforms that support [compute
shaders](../Manual/class-ComputeShader.html).  
  
DrawProceduralIndirect does a draw call on the GPU, without any vertex or
index buffers. If the shader requires vertex buffers one of the following
occurs depending on platform: If the vertex buffer is declared but compiler
can optimize it away then the normal DrawProcedural call will occur. If the
compiler is not able to optimize the vertex buffer declaration away then this
will be converted into a normal mesh drawing call with emulated vertexbuffers
injected. The latter option has performance overhead so it is recommended not
to declare vertex inputs in shaders when using DrawProceduralIndirect. The
amount of geometry to draw is read from a [ComputeBuffer](ComputeBuffer.html).
Typical use case is generating an arbitrary amount of data from a
[ComputeShader](ComputeShader.html) and then rendering that, without requiring
a readback to the CPU.  
  
This is mainly useful on [Shader Model 4.5](../Manual/SL-
ShaderCompileTargets.html) level hardware where shaders can read arbitrary
data from [ComputeBuffer](ComputeBuffer.html) buffers.  
  
Buffer with arguments, `bufferWithArgs`, has to have four integer numbers at
given `argsOffset` offset: vertex count per instance, instance count, start
vertex location, and start instance location. This maps to Direct3D11
DrawInstancedIndirect and equivalent functions on other graphics APIs. On
OpenGL versions before 4.2 and all OpenGL ES versions that support indirect
draw, the last argument is reserved and therefore must be zero.  
  
There's also similar functionality in CommandBuffers, see
[CommandBuffer.DrawProceduralIndirect](Rendering.CommandBuffer.DrawProceduralIndirect.html).

### Description

Draws procedural geometry on the GPU.

DrawProceduralIndirect does a draw call on the GPU, without a vertex buffer.
The amount of geometry to draw is read from a
[ComputeBuffer](ComputeBuffer.html). Typical use case is generating an
arbitrary amount of data from a [ComputeShader](ComputeShader.html) and then
rendering that, without requiring a readback to the CPU.  
  
This is mainly useful on [Shader Model 4.5](../Manual/SL-
ShaderCompileTargets.html) level hardware where shaders can read arbitrary
data from [ComputeBuffer](ComputeBuffer.html) buffers.  
  
Buffer with arguments, `bufferWithArgs`, has to have five integer numbers at
given `argsOffset` offset: index count per instance, instance count, start
index location, base vertex location, and start instance location. This maps
to Direct3D11 DrawIndexedInstancedIndirect and equivalent functions on other
graphics APIs. On OpenGL versions before 4.2 and all OpenGL ES versions that
support indirect draw, the last argument is reserved and therefore must be
zero.  
  
There's also similar functionality in CommandBuffers, see
[CommandBuffer.DrawProceduralIndirect](Rendering.CommandBuffer.DrawProceduralIndirect.html).
