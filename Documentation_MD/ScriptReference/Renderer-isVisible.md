public bool isVisible;

### Description

Is this renderer visible in any camera? (Read Only)

Note that the object is considered visible when it needs to be rendered in the
Scene. For example, it might not actually be visible by any camera but still
need to be rendered for shadows. When running in the editor, the Scene view
cameras will also cause this value to be true.

    //If the [GameObject](GameObject.html) is visible to the camera, the message is output to the console  
      
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class IsVisible : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
