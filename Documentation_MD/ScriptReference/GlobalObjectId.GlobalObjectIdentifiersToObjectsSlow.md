## Declaration

public static void GlobalObjectIdentifiersToObjectsSlow(GlobalObjectId[]
identifiers, out Object[] outputObjects);

### Parameters

identifiers | Array of GlobalObjectIds to convert to object references.  
---|---  
outputObjects | Array of `Objects` to write object references to.  
  
### Description

Creates an array of object references based on an array of unique object
identifiers.

For each item in `identifiers`, this method obtains a reference to the
underlying object and writes it to the corresponding element in
`outputObjects`. Both arrays must be the same size.  
  
Any `GlobalObjectIds` in the `identifiers` array that can't be resolved are
given a value of `null` in the output `outputObjects` array. This method is
slow. Use it sparingly. If you use this method in a large project within other
performance-sensitive contexts such as
[ISerializationCallbackReceiver.OnBeforeSerialize](ISerializationCallbackReceiver.OnBeforeSerialize.html)
or
[ISerializationCallbackReceiver.OnAfterDeserialize](ISerializationCallbackReceiver.OnAfterDeserialize.html),
it's strongly recommended to profile the performance impact.
