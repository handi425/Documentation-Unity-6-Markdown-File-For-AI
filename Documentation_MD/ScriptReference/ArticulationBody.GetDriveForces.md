ArticulationBody Component in the Manual")

## Declaration

public int GetDriveForces(List<float> forces);

### Parameters

forces | Supplied list of floats to store the drive force data.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**int** Total degrees of freedom (DOF) for the entire hierarchy of
Articulation Bodies.

### Description

Reads the entire hierarchy of Articulation Bodies and fills the supplied list
of floats with Articulation Drive forces.

This returns Articulation Drive forces in the reduced coordinate space for the
entire Articulation hierarchy starting from the root to the supplied list of
floats. Every drive force DOF is represented by one float value. However,
there might be zero, one or three DOFs per joint, depending on the type of the
articulation joint. To find the exact location of the data in the resulting
list for the specific Articulation Body, call
[ArticulationBody.GetDofStartIndices](ArticulationBody.GetDofStartIndices.html)
and index the returned dofStartIndices list by the particular body index with
[ArticulationBody.index](ArticulationBody-index.html). To find the number of
DOF for the Articulation Body, use
[ArticulationBody.dofCount](ArticulationBody-dofCount.html).
