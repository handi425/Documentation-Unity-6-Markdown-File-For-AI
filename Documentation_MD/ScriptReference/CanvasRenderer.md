### Description

A component that will render to the screen after all normal rendering has
completed when attached to a [Canvas](Canvas.html). Designed for GUI
application.

Additional resources:[Canvas](Canvas.html).

### Properties

[absoluteDepth](CanvasRenderer-absoluteDepth.html)| Depth of the renderer
relative to the root canvas.  
---|---  
[clippingSoftness](CanvasRenderer-clippingSoftness.html)| The clipping
softness to apply to the renderer.  
[cull](CanvasRenderer-cull.html)| Indicates whether geometry emitted by this
renderer is ignored.  
[cullTransparentMesh](CanvasRenderer-cullTransparentMesh.html)| Indicates
whether geometry emitted by this renderer can be ignored when the vertex color
alpha is close to zero for every vertex of the mesh.  
[hasMoved](CanvasRenderer-hasMoved.html)| True if any change has occured that
would invalidate the positions of generated geometry.  
[hasPopInstruction](CanvasRenderer-hasPopInstruction.html)| Enable 'render
stack' pop draw call.  
[hasRectClipping](CanvasRenderer-hasRectClipping.html)| True if rect clipping
has been enabled on this renderer. Additional resources:
CanvasRenderer.EnableRectClipping, CanvasRenderer.DisableRectClipping.  
[materialCount](CanvasRenderer-materialCount.html)| The number of materials
usable by this renderer.  
[popMaterialCount](CanvasRenderer-popMaterialCount.html)| The number of
materials usable by this renderer. Used internally for masking.  
[relativeDepth](CanvasRenderer-relativeDepth.html)| Depth of the renderer
realative to the parent canvas.  
  
### Public Methods

[Clear](CanvasRenderer.Clear.html)| Remove all cached vertices.  
---|---  
[DisableRectClipping](CanvasRenderer.DisableRectClipping.html)| Disables
rectangle clipping for this CanvasRenderer.  
[EnableRectClipping](CanvasRenderer.EnableRectClipping.html)| Enables rect
clipping on the CanvasRendered. Geometry outside of the specified rect will be
clipped (not rendered).  
[GetAlpha](CanvasRenderer.GetAlpha.html)| Get the current alpha of the
renderer.  
[GetColor](CanvasRenderer.GetColor.html)| Get the current color of the
renderer.  
[GetInheritedAlpha](CanvasRenderer.GetInheritedAlpha.html)| Get the final
inherited alpha calculated by including all the parent alphas from included
parent CanvasGroups.  
[GetMaterial](CanvasRenderer.GetMaterial.html)| Gets the current Material
assigned to the CanvasRenderer.  
[GetMesh](CanvasRenderer.GetMesh.html)| Returns the current mesh used to
render the canvas content into.  
[GetPopMaterial](CanvasRenderer.GetPopMaterial.html)| Gets the current
Material assigned to the CanvasRenderer. Used internally for masking.  
[SetAlpha](CanvasRenderer.SetAlpha.html)| Set the alpha of the renderer. Will
be multiplied with the UIVertex alpha and the Canvas alpha.  
[SetAlphaTexture](CanvasRenderer.SetAlphaTexture.html)| The Alpha Texture that
will be passed to the Shader under the _AlphaTex property.  
[SetColor](CanvasRenderer.SetColor.html)| Set the color of the renderer. Will
be multiplied with the UIVertex color and the Canvas color.  
[SetMaterial](CanvasRenderer.SetMaterial.html)| Set the material for the
canvas renderer. If a texture is specified then it will be used as the
'MainTex' instead of the material's 'MainTex'. Additional resources:
CanvasRenderer.materialCount, CanvasRenderer.SetTexture.  
[SetMesh](CanvasRenderer.SetMesh.html)| Sets the Mesh used by this renderer.
Note the Mesh must be read/write enabled.  
[SetPopMaterial](CanvasRenderer.SetPopMaterial.html)| Set the material for the
canvas renderer. Used internally for masking.  
[SetTexture](CanvasRenderer.SetTexture.html)| Sets the texture used by this
renderer's material.  
  
### Static Methods

[AddUIVertexStream](CanvasRenderer.AddUIVertexStream.html)| Take the Vertex
stream and split it corrisponding arrays (positions, colors, uv0s, uv1s,
normals and tangents).  
---|---  
[CreateUIVertexStream](CanvasRenderer.CreateUIVertexStream.html)| Convert a
set of vertex components into a stream of UIVertex.  
[SplitUIVertexStreams](CanvasRenderer.SplitUIVertexStreams.html)| Given a list
of UIVertex, split the stream into it's component types.  
  
### Events

that gets fired whenever the data in the CanvasRenderer gets invalidated and
needs to be rebuilt.  
---|---
