public float stiffness;

### Description

Multiplier for the [extremumValue](WheelFrictionCurve-extremumValue.html) and
[asymptoteValue](WheelFrictionCurve-asymptoteValue.html) values (default 1).

Changes the stiffness of the friction. Setting this to zero will completely
disable all friction from the wheel.  
  
Usually you modify `stiffness` to simulate various ground materials (e.g.
lower the stiffness when driving on grass). Additional resources:
[WheelCollider.GetGroundHit](WheelCollider.GetGroundHit.html).

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public [WheelCollider](WheelCollider.html) wheel;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            wheel = GetComponent<[WheelCollider](WheelCollider.html)>();
        }  
      
        // When attached to the [WheelCollider](WheelCollider.html), modifies tire friction based on
        // static friction of the ground material.
        void [FixedUpdate](PlayerLoop.FixedUpdate.html)()
        {
            [WheelHit](WheelHit.html) hit;
            if (wheel.GetGroundHit(out hit))
            {
                [WheelFrictionCurve](WheelFrictionCurve.html) fFriction = wheel.forwardFriction;
                fFriction.stiffness = hit.collider.material.staticFriction;
                wheel.forwardFriction = fFriction;
                [WheelFrictionCurve](WheelFrictionCurve.html) sFriction = wheel.sidewaysFriction;
                sFriction.stiffness = hit.collider.material.staticFriction;
                wheel.sidewaysFriction = sFriction;
            }
        }
    }
