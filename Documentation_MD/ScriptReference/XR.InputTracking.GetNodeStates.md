## Declaration

public static void GetNodeStates(List<XRNodeState> nodeStates);

### Parameters

nodeStates | A list that is populated with [XRNodeState](XR.XRNodeState.html) objects.  
---|---  
  
### Description

Describes all currently connected XRNodes and provides available tracking
states for each.

Use this method to acquire all the currently available XR input Nodes, as an
alternative to handling the node events
[InputTracking.nodeAdded](XR.InputTracking-nodeAdded.html) and
[InputTracking.nodeRemoved](XR.InputTracking-nodeRemoved.html). The contents
of `nodeStates` list will be cleared and replaced with fresh data.  
Not all XR platforms provide complete tracking data. Use the methods
[XRNodeState.TryGetPosition](XR.XRNodeState.TryGetPosition.html),
[XRNodeState.TryGetRotation](XR.XRNodeState.TryGetRotation.html), etc. to read
the data if it's available.
