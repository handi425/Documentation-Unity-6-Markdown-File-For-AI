## Declaration

[MeshTopology](MeshTopology.html) topology, int submesh, bool calculateBounds,
int baseVertex);

### Parameters

indices | The array of indices that define the mesh faces.  
---|---  
topology | The topology of the Mesh, e.g: Triangles, Lines, Quads, Points, etc. See [MeshTopology](MeshTopology.html).  
submesh | The sub-mesh to modify.  
calculateBounds | Calculate the bounding box of the sub-mesh after setting the indices. Unity does this by default. Use false when you want to use the existing bounding box and reduce the CPU cost of setting the indices.  
baseVertex | Optional vertex offset that is added to all vertex indices.  
  
### Description

Sets the index buffer for the sub-mesh.

A sub-mesh represents a list of triangles (or indices with a different
[MeshTopology](MeshTopology.html)) that are rendered using a single
[Material](Material.html). When the Mesh is used with a
[Renderer](Renderer.html) that has multiple materials, you should ensure that
there is one sub-mesh per Material.  
  
[SetTriangles](Mesh.SetTriangles.html) and [triangles](Mesh-triangles.html)
always set the Mesh to be composed of triangle faces. Use SetIndices to create
a Mesh composed of lines or points.  
  
The `baseVertex` argument can be used to achieve meshes that are larger than
65536 vertices while using 16 bit index buffers, as long as each sub-mesh
index fits within its own 65535 value range. For example, if the index buffer
that is passed to SetIndices contains indices 10,11,12 and `baseVertex` is set
to 100000, then effectively vertices 100010, 100011 and 100012 will be used
for rendering.  
  
Note that meshes use 16-bit [indexFormat](Mesh-indexFormat.html) by default,
i.e. the maximum value supported in the index buffer is 65535 (even when using
int[] input data). In order to use larger index buffer values, you should
first set the [indexFormat](Mesh-indexFormat.html) to
[IndexFormat.UInt32](Rendering.IndexFormat.UInt32.html).  
  
Call [Mesh.RecalculateBounds](Mesh.RecalculateBounds.html) after updating all
sub-meshes if you want to update the [Mesh](Mesh.html)'s bounding box.

## Declaration

## Declaration

## Declaration

public void SetIndices(NativeArray<T> indices, int indicesStart, int
indicesLength, [MeshTopology](MeshTopology.html) topology, int submesh, bool
calculateBounds, int baseVertex);

### Parameters

indices | The array of indices that define the mesh faces.  
---|---  
indicesStart | Index of the first element to take from the input array.  
indicesLength | Number of elements to take from the input array.  
topology | The topology of the Mesh, e.g: Triangles, Lines, Quads, Points, etc. See [MeshTopology](MeshTopology.html).  
submesh | The sub-mesh to modify.  
calculateBounds | Calculate the bounding box of the sub-mesh after setting the indices. Unity does this by default. Use false when you want to use the existing bounding box and reduce the CPU cost of setting the indices.  
baseVertex | Optional vertex offset that is added to all vertex indices.  
  
### Description

Sets the index buffer of a sub-mesh, using a part of the input array.

This method behaves as if you called SetIndices with an array that is a slice
of the whole array, starting at `indicesStart` index and being of a given
`indicesLength` length. The resulting sub-mesh will have `indicesLength`
amount of vertex indices.
