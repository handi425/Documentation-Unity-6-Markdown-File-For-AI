[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-Quaternion.html "Go to Quaternion Component
in the Manual")

## Declaration

public static [Quaternion](Quaternion.html) Lerp([Quaternion](Quaternion.html)
a, [Quaternion](Quaternion.html) b, float t);

### Parameters

a | Start unit quaternion value, returned when t = 0.  
---|---  
b | End unit quaternion value, returned when t = 1.  
t | Interpolation ratio. The value is clamped to the range [0, 1].  
  
### Returns

**Quaternion** A unit quaternion interpolated between quaternions `a` and `b`.

### Description

Interpolates between `a` and `b` by `t` and normalizes the result afterwards.

This is faster than Slerp but the angular velocity will not be constant if the
rotations are far apart.

    
    
    // Interpolates rotation between the rotations
    // of from and to.
    // (Choose from and to not to be the same as
    // the object you attach this script to)  
      
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        [Transform](Transform.html) from;
        [Transform](Transform.html) to;
        float speed = 0.01f;
        float timeCount = 0.0f;  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            transform.rotation = [Quaternion.Lerp](Quaternion.Lerp.html)(from.rotation, to.rotation, timeCount * speed);
            timeCount = timeCount + [Time.deltaTime](Time-deltaTime.html);
        }
    }
