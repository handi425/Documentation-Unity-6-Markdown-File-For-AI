in the Manual")

## Declaration

public void AddRelativeTorque([Vector3](Vector3.html) torque,
[ForceMode](ForceMode.html) mode = ForceMode.Force);

### Parameters

torque | Torque vector in local coordinates.  
---|---  
  
### Description

Adds a torque to the rigidbody relative to its coordinate system.

Force can be applied only to an active rigidbody. If a GameObject is inactive,
AddRelativeTorque has no effect.  
  
Wakes up the Rigidbody by default. If the torque size is zero then the
Rigidbody will not be woken up.  
  
For more information on how ForceMode affects angular velocity, see
[Rigidbody.AddTorque](Rigidbody.AddTorque.html).  
  
Additional resources: [AddTorque](Rigidbody.AddTorque.html),
[AddRelativeForce](Rigidbody.AddRelativeForce.html).

    
    
    // [Rotate](UIElements.Rotate.html) an object around its Y (upward) axis in response to
    // left/right controls.  
      
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public float torque;
        public [Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html) rb;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            rb = GetComponent<[Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html)>();
        }  
      
        void [FixedUpdate](PlayerLoop.FixedUpdate.html)()
        {
            float turn = [Input.GetAxis](Input.GetAxis.html)("Horizontal");
            rb.AddRelativeTorque([Vector3.up](Vector3-up.html) * torque * turn);
        }
    }

## Declaration

public void AddRelativeTorque(float x, float y, float z,
[ForceMode](ForceMode.html) mode = ForceMode.Force);

### Parameters

x | Size of torque along the local x-axis.  
---|---  
y | Size of torque along the local y-axis.  
z | Size of torque along the local z-axis.  
  
### Description

Adds a torque to the rigidbody relative to its coordinate system.

Force can be applied only to an active rigidbody. If a GameObject is inactive,
AddRelativeTorque has no effect.  
  
Wakes up the Rigidbody by default. If the torque size is zero then the
Rigidbody will not be woken up.
