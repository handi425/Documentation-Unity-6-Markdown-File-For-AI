### Description

Either remove or include the specified shader keywords in the build, depending
on the data field underneath.

Unity does the following in all `multi_compile` keyword sets:

  * Removes `keywordNames` if the data field under `RemoveOrSelect` matches the value of `condition`.
  * Includes only `keywordNames` if the data field under `RemoveOrSelect` does not match the value of `condition`.

    
    
    using UnityEditor.ShaderKeywordFilter;  
      
    [RemoveOrSelect(false, keywordNames: "FeatureA")]
    bool hasFeatureA;
