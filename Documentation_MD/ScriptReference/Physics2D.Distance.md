## Declaration

public static [ColliderDistance2D](ColliderDistance2D.html)
Distance([Collider2D](Collider2D.html) colliderA,
[Collider2D](Collider2D.html) colliderB);

### Parameters

colliderA | A Collider used to calculate the minimum distance against `colliderB`.  
---|---  
colliderB | A Collider used to calculate the minimum distance against `colliderA`.  
  
### Returns

**ColliderDistance2D** The minimum distance between `colliderA` and
`colliderB`.

### Description

Calculates the minimum distance between two Colliders.

A valid `colliderA` and `colliderB` must be provided for the returned
[ColliderDistance2D](ColliderDistance2D.html) to be valid i.e. both
`colliderA` or `colliderB` should not be NULL, should not be disabled and must
contain collision shapes. You can check if the returned value is valid by
checking [ColliderDistance2D.isValid](ColliderDistance2D-isValid.html).  
  
Additional resources: [Collider2D.Distance](Collider2D.Distance.html) and
[Rigidbody2D.Distance](Rigidbody2D.Distance.html).

## Declaration

public static [ColliderDistance2D](ColliderDistance2D.html)
Distance([Collider2D](Collider2D.html) colliderA, [Vector2](Vector2.html)
positionA, float angleA, [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) colliderB,
[Vector2](Vector2.html) positionB, float angleB);

### Parameters

colliderA | A Collider used to calculate the minimum distance against `colliderB`.  
---|---  
positionA | The position to use for `colliderA`.  
angleA | The rotation to use for `colliderA`.  
colliderB | A Collider used to calculate the minimum distance against `colliderA`.  
positionB | The position to use for `colliderB`.  
angleB | The rotation to use for `colliderB`.  
  
### Returns

**ColliderDistance2D** The minimum distance between `colliderA` and
`colliderB`.

### Description

Calculates the minimum distance between two Colliders.

A valid `colliderA` and `colliderB` must be provided for the returned
[ColliderDistance2D](ColliderDistance2D.html) to be valid i.e. both
`colliderA` or `colliderB` should not be NULL, should not be disabled and must
contain collision shapes. You can check if the returned value is valid by
checking [ColliderDistance2D.isValid](ColliderDistance2D-isValid.html).  
  
**NOTE** : The positions and angles used here represent the position of the
[Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) the respective [Collider2D](Collider2D.html)
is attached to. If the [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) is offset from the center
of mass then the [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) will use the same offset. This
can be confusing so it is recommened that only [Collider2D](Collider2D.html)
that align with the center of mass are used. If not then you must take this
into account. If the [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) is not attached to a
[Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html), this call cannot be used and will result in a
warning.
