## Declaration

public static void BeginSample(IntPtr markerPtr);

### Parameters

markerPtr | Profiler marker handle.  
---|---  
  
### Description

Starts profiling a piece of code marked with a custom name that the
_markerPtr_ handle has defined.

Code marked with
[BeginSample](Unity.Profiling.LowLevel.Unsafe.ProfilerUnsafeUtility.BeginSample.html)
and
[EndSample](Unity.Profiling.LowLevel.Unsafe.ProfilerUnsafeUtility.EndSample.html)
shows up in the Profiler hierarchy. Always use
[EndSample](Unity.Profiling.LowLevel.Unsafe.ProfilerUnsafeUtility.EndSample.html)
to close a started section of the instrumented code.  
  
  
**Note:** Both
[BeginSample](Unity.Profiling.LowLevel.Unsafe.ProfilerUnsafeUtility.BeginSample.html)
and
[EndSample](Unity.Profiling.LowLevel.Unsafe.ProfilerUnsafeUtility.EndSample.html)
are thread safe and can be used in jobified code.  
The low level Profiler API is included in a Release Build.

    
    
    using Unity.Collections.LowLevel.Unsafe;
    using Unity.Profiling.LowLevel;
    using Unity.Profiling.LowLevel.Unsafe;
    using [System](Rendering.VirtualTexturing.System.html);  
      
    class Example
    {
        static readonly IntPtr markerHandle = [ProfilerUnsafeUtility.CreateMarker](Unity.Profiling.LowLevel.Unsafe.ProfilerUnsafeUtility.CreateMarker.html)("MyMarker", [ProfilerUnsafeUtility.CategoryScripts](Unity.Profiling.LowLevel.Unsafe.ProfilerUnsafeUtility.CategoryScripts.html), [MarkerFlags.Default](Unity.Profiling.LowLevel.MarkerFlags.Default.html), 0);
        static unsafe void DoWork(int num)
        {
            [ProfilerUnsafeUtility.BeginSample](Unity.Profiling.LowLevel.Unsafe.ProfilerUnsafeUtility.BeginSample.html)(markerHandle);
            //...
            [ProfilerUnsafeUtility.EndSample](Unity.Profiling.LowLevel.Unsafe.ProfilerUnsafeUtility.EndSample.html)(markerHandle);
        }
    }
    

Use [Recorder](Profiling.Recorder.html) to obtain per-frame timings in the
Player for the specific marker name.
