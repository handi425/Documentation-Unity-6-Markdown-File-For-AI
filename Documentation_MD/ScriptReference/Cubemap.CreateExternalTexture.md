## Declaration

public static [Cubemap](Cubemap.html) CreateExternalTexture(int width,
[TextureFormat](TextureFormat.html) format, bool mipmap, IntPtr nativeTex);

### Parameters

size | The width and height of each face of the cubemap should be the same.  
---|---  
format | Format of underlying cubemap object.  
mipmap | Does the cubemap have mipmaps?  
nativeTex | Native cubemap texture object.  
  
### Description

Creates a Unity cubemap out of externally created native cubemap object.

This method is mostly useful for [native code plugins](../Manual/native-
plugin-interface.html) that create platform specific cubemap texture objects
outside of Unity, and need to use these cubemaps in Unity Scenes.  
  
Parameters passed to CreateExternalTexture should match what the texture
actually is; and the underlying texture should be a Cubemap (2D textures will
not work).  
  
Native texture object on Direct3D-like devices is a pointer to the base type,
from which a texture can be created (ID3D11ShaderResourceView on D3D11). On
OpenGL/OpenGL ES it is GLuint. On Metal it is id<MTLTexture>.
