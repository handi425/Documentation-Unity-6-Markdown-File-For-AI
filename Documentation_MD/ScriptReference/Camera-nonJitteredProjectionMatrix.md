[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-Camera.html "Go to Camera Component in the
Manual")

public [Matrix4x4](Matrix4x4.html) nonJitteredProjectionMatrix;

### Description

Get or set the raw projection matrix with no camera offset (no jittering).

For many temporal image effects, the camera that is currently rendering needs
to be slightly offset from the default projection (that is, the camera is
‘jittered’). Use this function to specify the default (non-jittered)
perspective matrix that was used before the offset was applied. It is possible
to configure whether the jittered or non jittered matrix should be used for
objects rendered after the opaque objects pass (transparent objects for
example), see
[Camera.useJitteredProjectionMatrixForTransparentRendering](Camera-
useJitteredProjectionMatrixForTransparentRendering.html).  
  
If you use motion vectors and camera jittering together, use this property to
keep the motion vectors stable between frames.  
  
Set the jittered matrix using [Camera.projectionMatrix](Camera-
projectionMatrix.html).
