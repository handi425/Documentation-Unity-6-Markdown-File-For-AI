## Declaration

public bool SupportsRemappedAssetType(Type type);

### Parameters

type | The type of asset to check.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**bool** Returns true if the importer supports remapping the given type.
Otherwise, returns false.

### Description

Override this method if your
[ScriptedImporter](AssetImporters.ScriptedImporter.html) supports remapping
specific asset types.

A remapped asset must be explicitly handled by the importer. For example, an
importer for a file format that supports materials can assign a remapped
[Material](Material.html) reference from the external object map directly to
the [MeshRenderer](MeshRenderer.html) component.  
  
Additional resources:
[AssetImporter.GetExternalObjectMap](AssetImporter.GetExternalObjectMap.html).
