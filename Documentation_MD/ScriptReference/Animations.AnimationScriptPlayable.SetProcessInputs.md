## Declaration

public void SetProcessInputs(bool value);

### Parameters

value | The new value for processing the inputs or not.  
---|---  
  
### Description

Sets the new value for processing the inputs or not.

In some cases, like for custom mixers, it is wanted to have full control over
which inputs are processed or not. This method allows to set that: when set to
`true` (the default value), all the inputs are processed before processing the
current [AnimationScriptPlayable](Animations.AnimationScriptPlayable.html);
when set to `false`, the playable inputs aren't processed and the user can
force to process specific inputs using
[AnimationStream.GetInputStream](Animations.AnimationStream.GetInputStream.html)
on the `stream` provided with the methods in
[IAnimationJob](Animations.IAnimationJob.html).  
  
Additional resources: [AnimationStream](Animations.AnimationStream.html).
