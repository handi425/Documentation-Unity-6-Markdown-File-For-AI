### Description

Suspends the coroutine execution until the supplied delegate evaluates to
`true`.

WaitUntil can only be used with a `yield` statement in coroutines.  
  
Supplied delegate will be executed each frame after script
[MonoBehaviour.Update](MonoBehaviour.Update.html) and before
[MonoBehaviour.LateUpdate](MonoBehaviour.LateUpdate.html). When the delegate
finally evaluates to `true`, the coroutine will proceed with its execution.

[WaitForEndOfFrame](WaitForEndOfFrame.html),
[WaitForFixedUpdate](WaitForFixedUpdate.html),
[WaitForSeconds](WaitForSeconds.html),
[WaitForSecondsRealtime](WaitForSecondsRealtime.html),
[WaitWhile](WaitWhile.html).

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class WaitUntilExample : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public int frame;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            StartCoroutine(Example());
        }  
      
        IEnumerator Example()
        {
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("Waiting for princess to be rescued...");
            yield return new [WaitUntil](WaitUntil.html)(() => frame >= 10);
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("Princess was rescued!");
        }  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            if (frame <= 10)
            {
                [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("Frame: " + frame);
                frame++;
            }
        }
    }
