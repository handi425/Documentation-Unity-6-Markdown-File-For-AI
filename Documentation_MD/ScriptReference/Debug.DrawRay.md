## Declaration

public static void DrawRay([Vector3](Vector3.html) start,
[Vector3](Vector3.html) dir, [Color](Color.html) color = Color.white, float
duration = 0.0f, bool depthTest = true);

### Parameters

start | Point in world space where the ray should start.  
---|---  
dir | Direction and length of the ray.  
color | Color of the drawn line.  
duration | How long the line will be visible for (in seconds).  
depthTest | Determines whether objects closer to the camera obscure the line.  
  
### Description

Draws a line from `start` to `start` \+ `dir` in world coordinates.

The `duration` parameter determines how long the line will be visible after
the frame it is drawn. If duration is 0 (the default) then the line is
rendered 1 frame.  
  
If `depthTest` is set to true then the line will be obscured by other objects
in the Scene that are nearer to the camera.  
  
The line will be drawn in the Scene view of the editor. If gizmo drawing is
enabled in the game view, the line will also be drawn there.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        // Frame update example: Draws a 10 meter long green line from the position for 1 frame.
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            [Vector3](Vector3.html) forward = transform.TransformDirection([Vector3.forward](Vector3-forward.html)) * 10;
            [Debug.DrawRay](Debug.DrawRay.html)(transform.position, forward, [Color.green](Color-green.html));
        }
    }
    
    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        // [Event](Event.html) callback example: [Debug](Debug.html)-draw all contact points and normals for 2 seconds.
        void OnCollisionEnter([Collision](Collision.html) collision)
        {
            [Debug.DrawRay](Debug.DrawRay.html)(collision.contacts[0].point, collision.contacts[0].normal, [Color.green](Color-green.html), 2, false);
        }
    }
