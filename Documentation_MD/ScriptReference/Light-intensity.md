Manual")

public float intensity;

### Description

The Intensity of a light is multiplied with the Light color.

The value can be between 0 and 8. This allows you to create over bright
lights.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        [Light](Light.html) myLight;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            myLight = GetComponent<[Light](Light.html)>();
        }  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            myLight.intensity = [Mathf.PingPong](Mathf.PingPong.html)([Time.time](Time-time.html), 8);
        }
    }
