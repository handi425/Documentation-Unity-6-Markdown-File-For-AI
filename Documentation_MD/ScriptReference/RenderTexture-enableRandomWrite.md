[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-RenderTexture.html "Go to RenderTexture
Component in the Manual")

public bool enableRandomWrite;

### Description

Enable random access write into this render texture on Shader Model 5.0 level
shaders.

Shader Model 5.0 level pixel or compute shaders can write into arbitrary
locations of some textures, called "unordered access views" in
[UsingDX11GL3Features](../Manual/UsingDX11GL3Features.html). Set this flag
before creating your render texture to enable this capability.  
  
When a texture has this flag set, it can be written into as one RWTexture*
resources in HLSL or image resources in GLSL. It can also be set as random
access write target for pixel shaders using
[Graphics.SetRandomWriteTarget](Graphics.SetRandomWriteTarget.html).  
  
Use
[SystemInfo.SupportsRandomWriteOnRenderTextureFormat](SystemInfo.SupportsRandomWriteOnRenderTextureFormat.html)
to validate if a given format can be used as this depends on the graphics
API/hardware/driver.
