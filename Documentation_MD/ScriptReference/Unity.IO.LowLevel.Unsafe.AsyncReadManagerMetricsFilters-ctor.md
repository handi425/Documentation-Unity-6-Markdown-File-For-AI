## Declaration

public AsyncReadManagerMetricsFilters();

## Declaration

public AsyncReadManagerMetricsFilters(ulong typeID);

## Declaration

public
AsyncReadManagerMetricsFilters([Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.ProcessingState](Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.ProcessingState.html)
state);

## Declaration

public
AsyncReadManagerMetricsFilters([Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.FileReadType](Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.FileReadType.html)
readType);

## Declaration

public
AsyncReadManagerMetricsFilters([Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.Priority](Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.Priority.html)
priorityLevel);

## Declaration

public
AsyncReadManagerMetricsFilters([Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.AssetLoadingSubsystem](Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.AssetLoadingSubsystem.html)
subsystem);

### Parameters

typeID | The YAML Class ID for the asset type to include in the summary calculations. See the [YAML Class ID Reference](../Manual/ClassIDReference.html) page.  
---|---  
state | The Processing State to include in the summary calculations.  
readType | The type of file read (async or sync) to include in the summary calculations.  
priorityLevel | The priority level to include in the summary calculations.  
subsystem | The Subsystem 'tag' to include in the summary calculations.  
  
### Description

Constructor for an instance of the Summary Metrics Filters, used to filter the
metrics data that is included in the calculation of a summary.

The constructor takes one value of a filter. To take multiple values for the
same filter, you can use the array constructor (below). For multiple filters,
use the Set method for additional required filter types.

    
    
    using Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe;
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class GetMetricsSummary : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
    #if ENABLE_PROFILER && UNITY_2020_2_OR_NEWER
        public void Start()
        {
            // Create a filter for texture file reads that have been completed
            [AsyncReadManagerMetricsFilters](Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.AsyncReadManagerMetricsFilters.html) m_TextureFilter = new [AsyncReadManagerMetricsFilters](Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.AsyncReadManagerMetricsFilters.html)([AssetLoadingSubsystem.Texture](Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.AssetLoadingSubsystem.Texture.html));
            m_TextureFilter.SetStateFilter([ProcessingState.Completed](Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.ProcessingState.Completed.html));
        }  
      
    #endif
    }

## Declaration

public AsyncReadManagerMetricsFilters(ulong[] typeIDs, ProcessingState[]
states, FileReadType[] readTypes, Priority[] priorityLevels,
AssetLoadingSubsystem[] subsystems);

## Declaration

public AsyncReadManagerMetricsFilters(ulong[] typeIDs);

## Declaration

public AsyncReadManagerMetricsFilters(ProcessingState[] states);

## Declaration

public AsyncReadManagerMetricsFilters(FileReadType[] readTypes);

## Declaration

public AsyncReadManagerMetricsFilters(Priority[] priorityLevels);

## Declaration

public AsyncReadManagerMetricsFilters(AssetLoadingSubsystem[] subsystems);

### Parameters

typeIDs | An array of all the [TypeIDs](../Manual/ClassIDReference.html) to include in the summary calculations.  
---|---  
states | An array of all the ProcessingStates to include in the summary calculations.  
readTypes | An array of all the FileReadTypes to include in the summary calculations. As there are only two options, this is generally unnecesary.  
priorityLevels | An array of all the Priority levels to include in the summary calculations. As there are only two options, this is generally unnecesary.  
subsystems | An array of all the Subsystem 'tags' to include in the summary calculations.  
  
### Description

Constructor for an instance of the Summary Metrics Filters, used to filter the
metrics data that is included in the calculation of a summary.

The constructor takes an array of values for a single filter, or for all of
the filters. For multiple filters, but not all, use the Set method for
additional required filter types.

    
    
    using Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe;
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class GetMetricsSummary : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
    #if ENABLE_PROFILER && UNITY_2020_2_OR_NEWER
        public void Start()
        {
            // Create a filter for mesh and texture file reads that have been completed or failed
            [AssetLoadingSubsystem](Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.AssetLoadingSubsystem.html)[] assetLoadingSubsystems = new [AssetLoadingSubsystem](Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.AssetLoadingSubsystem.html)[] {[AssetLoadingSubsystem.Texture](Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.AssetLoadingSubsystem.Texture.html), [AssetLoadingSubsystem.Mesh](Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.AssetLoadingSubsystem.Mesh.html)};
            [AsyncReadManagerMetricsFilters](Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.AsyncReadManagerMetricsFilters.html) m_SummaryFilter = new [AsyncReadManagerMetricsFilters](Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.AsyncReadManagerMetricsFilters.html)(assetLoadingSubsystems);
            m_SummaryFilter.SetStateFilter(new [ProcessingState](Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.ProcessingState.html)[] { [ProcessingState.Completed](Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.ProcessingState.Completed.html), [ProcessingState.Failed](Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.ProcessingState.Failed.html) });
        }  
      
    #endif
    }
