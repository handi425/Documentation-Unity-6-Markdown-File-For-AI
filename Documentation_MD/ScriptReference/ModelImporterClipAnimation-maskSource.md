### Description

The AvatarMask used to mask transforms during the import process.

A mask can be used to discard transform when importing a clip to reduce memory
footprint for this clip. A source mask is only needed if
[ModelImporterClipAnimation.maskType](ModelImporterClipAnimation-
maskType.html) is set to
[ClipAnimationMaskType.CopyFromOther](ClipAnimationMaskType.CopyFromOther.html)
Additional resources: [ClipAnimationMaskType](ClipAnimationMaskType.html).
