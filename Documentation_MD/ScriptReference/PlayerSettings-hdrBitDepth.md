public static [HDRDisplayBitDepth](HDRDisplayBitDepth.html) hdrBitDepth;

### Description

The number of bits in each color channel for swap chain buffers.

The bit count defines the method Unity uses to render content to the display.
When set to `10`, Unity uses the R10G10B10A2 buffer format, Rec2020 primaries,
and ST2084 PQ encoding. When set to `16`, Unity uses the R16G16B16A16 buffer
format, Rec709 primaries, and linear color (no encoding).
