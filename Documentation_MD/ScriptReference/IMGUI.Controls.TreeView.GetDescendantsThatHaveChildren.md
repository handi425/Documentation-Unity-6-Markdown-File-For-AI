### Description

BuildRoot(), then override this method and use your back-end data to find the
correct descendants for the given item.  
  
  
Default behavior: The item with ID id is found by searching from the rootItem
through all its descendants. Once found, all its descendants that have
children are collected. Assumes the full tree has been built.
