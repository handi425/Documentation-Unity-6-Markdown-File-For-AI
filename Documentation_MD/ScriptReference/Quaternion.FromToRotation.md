in the Manual")

## Declaration

public static [Quaternion](Quaternion.html)
FromToRotation([Vector3](Vector3.html) fromDirection, [Vector3](Vector3.html)
toDirection);

### Parameters

fromDirection | A non-unit or unit vector representing a direction axis to rotate.  
---|---  
toDirection | A non-unit or unit vector representing the target direction axis.  
  
### Returns

**Quaternion** A unit quaternion which rotates from `fromDirection` to
`toDirection`.

### Description

Creates a rotation from `fromDirection` to `toDirection`.

Use this method to rotate a transform so that one of its axes, such as the
y-axis, follows the target direction, `toDirection`, in world space.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            // Sets the rotation so that the transform's y-axis goes along the global y-axis and the transform's z-axis goes along the global z-axis
            transform.rotation *= [Quaternion.FromToRotation](Quaternion.FromToRotation.html)(transform.up, [Vector3.up](Vector3-up.html));
            transform.rotation *= [Quaternion.FromToRotation](Quaternion.FromToRotation.html)(transform.forward, [Vector3.forward](Vector3-forward.html));
        }
    }
