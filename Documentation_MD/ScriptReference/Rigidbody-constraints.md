[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-Rigidbody.html "Go to Rigidbody Component
in the Manual")

public [RigidbodyConstraints](RigidbodyConstraints.html) constraints;

### Description

Controls which degrees of freedom are allowed for the simulation of this
Rigidbody.

By default this is set to
[RigidbodyConstraints.None](RigidbodyConstraints.None.html), allowing rotation
and movement along all axes. In some cases, you may want to constrain a
[Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html) to only move or rotate along some axes, for
example when developing 2D games. You can use the bitwise OR operator to
combine multiple constraints.  
  
Note that position constraints are applied in World space, and rotation
constraints are applied in the inertia space (relative to
[Rigidbody.inertiaTensorRotation](Rigidbody-inertiaTensorRotation.html)).

    
    
    //Attach this script to a [GameObject](GameObject.html).
    //Attach a [Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html) to the [GameObject](GameObject.html) by clicking the [GameObject](GameObject.html) in the [Hierarchy](UIElements.VisualElement.Hierarchy.html) and
    //clicking the **Add Component** button. Search for [Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html) in the field and select
    //it when shown.  
      
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        [Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html) m_Rigidbody;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            m_Rigidbody = GetComponent<[Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html)>();
            //This locks the RigidBody so that it does not move or rotate in the Z axis.
            m_Rigidbody.constraints = [RigidbodyConstraints.FreezePositionZ](RigidbodyConstraints.FreezePositionZ.html) | [RigidbodyConstraints.FreezeRotationZ](RigidbodyConstraints.FreezeRotationZ.html);
        }
    }
