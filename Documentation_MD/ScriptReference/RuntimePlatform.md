### Description

The platform application is running. Returned by Application.platform.

**Note:** The difference between using RuntimePlatform and Platform dependent
Compilation is that using RuntimePlatform is evaluated at runtime while
Platform dependent Compilation is evaluated at compile time. So if you can use
platform dependent compilation, don't hesitate to use it. In most cases, you
can get the same functionality using both, and using the defines will produce
smaller and faster code, as you don't need to check at runtime. There are some
cases where RuntimePlatform is needed at runtime.
