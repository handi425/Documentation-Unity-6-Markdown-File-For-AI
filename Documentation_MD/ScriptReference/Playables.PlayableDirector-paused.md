### Description

Event that is raised when a PlayableDirector component has paused.

Add an event handler, to this event, to receive a notification when a
PlayableDirector is paused. The handler also receives the PlayableDirector
that is paused.  
  
When using [PlayableBehaviour](Playables.PlayableBehaviour.html), this event
is raised before
[PlayableBehaviour.OnBehaviourPause](Playables.PlayableBehaviour.OnBehaviourPause.html).

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.Playables;  
      
    public class PlayableDirectorCallbackExample : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public [PlayableDirector](Playables.PlayableDirector.html) director;  
      
        void OnEnable()
        {
            director.paused += OnPlayableDirectorPaused;
        }  
      
        void OnPlayableDirectorPaused([PlayableDirector](Playables.PlayableDirector.html) aDirector)
        {
            if (director == aDirector)
                [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("[PlayableDirector](Playables.PlayableDirector.html) named " + aDirector.name + " is now paused.");
        }  
      
        void OnDisable()
        {
            director.paused -= OnPlayableDirectorPaused;
        }
    }
