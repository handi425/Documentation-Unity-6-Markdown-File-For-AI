## Declaration

public static void SingleSampleWithMetadata(IntPtr markerPtr, int
metadataCount, void* metadata);

### Parameters

markerPtr | Profiler marker handle.  
---|---  
metadataCount | Metadata parameters count.  
metadata | Unsafe pointer to the ProfilerMarkerData array.  
  
### Description

Creates profiling sample with a custom name that the _markerPtr_ handle and
metadata parameters has defined.

Sample created with
[SingleSampleWithMetadata](Unity.Profiling.LowLevel.Unsafe.ProfilerUnsafeUtility.SingleSampleWithMetadata.html)
shows up as a sample with zero duration in the Profiler hierarchy. In the
Timeline view of the Profiler Window the provided _metadata_ is available in
the tooltip message. Use
[HierarchyFrameDataView.GetItemMetadata](Profiling.HierarchyFrameDataView.GetItemMetadata.html)
to retrieve metadata programmatically.  
  
If _markerPtr_ points to a marker with
[MarkerFlags.Counter](Unity.Profiling.LowLevel.MarkerFlags.Counter.html)
defined, the metadata value can be retrieved with
[FrameDataView.GetCounterValueAsInt](Profiling.FrameDataView.GetCounterValueAsInt.html)
methods.  
  
**Note:**
[SingleSampleWithMetadata](Unity.Profiling.LowLevel.Unsafe.ProfilerUnsafeUtility.SingleSampleWithMetadata.html)
is thread safe and can be used in jobified code.  
The low level Profiler API is included in a Release Build.
