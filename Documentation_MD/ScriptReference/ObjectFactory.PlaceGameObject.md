## Declaration

public static void PlaceGameObject([GameObject](GameObject.html) go,
[GameObject](GameObject.html) parent);

### Parameters

go | The GameObject to be initialized.  
---|---  
parent | An optional GameObject to be set as the parent.  
  
### Description

Place the given GameObject in the Scene View using the same preferences as
built-in Unity GameObjects.

Use this method to create GameObjects centered in the Scene View or at world
origin, depending on user preference. This method also ensures that the
GameObject has a unique name, also as defined by preferences.

    
    
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    // Creates a new [GameObject](GameObject.html) with the same preferences that built-in GameObjects instantiate with.
    class CreateGameObjectExample
    {
        [[MenuItem](MenuItem.html)("[GameObject](GameObject.html)/3D Object/My Cube")]
        static void CreateCube([MenuCommand](MenuCommand.html) command)
        {
            var gameObject = [ObjectFactory.CreatePrimitive](ObjectFactory.CreatePrimitive.html)([PrimitiveType.Cube](PrimitiveType.Cube.html));
            [ObjectFactory.PlaceGameObject](ObjectFactory.PlaceGameObject.html)(gameObject, command.context as [GameObject](GameObject.html));
        }
    }
