AudioHighPassFilter Component in the Manual")

public float highpassResonanceQ;

### Description

Determines how much the filter's self-resonance isdampened.

Higher Highpass resonance Q indicates a lower rate of energy loss i.e. the
oscillations die out more slowly.  
  
Highpass resonance Q value goes from 1.0 to 10.0. Default = 1.0.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    [[RequireComponent](RequireComponent.html)(typeof([AudioSource](AudioSource.html)))]
    [[RequireComponent](RequireComponent.html)(typeof([AudioHighPassFilter](AudioHighPassFilter.html)))]
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        // Moves the Highpass Resonance Quality Factor from 0 to 10 following a Sinus function
        // Attach this to an audio source with a HighPassFilter to listen it working.  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            GetComponent<[AudioHighPassFilter](AudioHighPassFilter.html)>().highpassResonanceQ = ([Mathf.Sin](Mathf.Sin.html)([Time.time](Time-time.html)) * 5 + 5);
