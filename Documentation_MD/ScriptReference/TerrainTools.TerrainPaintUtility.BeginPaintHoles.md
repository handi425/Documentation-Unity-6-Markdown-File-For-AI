## Declaration

public static [TerrainTools.PaintContext](TerrainTools.PaintContext.html)
BeginPaintHoles([Terrain](Terrain.html) terrain, [Rect](Rect.html)
boundsInTerrainSpace, int extraBorderPixels = 0, bool fillOutsideTerrain =
true);

### Parameters

terrain | Reference Terrain tile.  
---|---  
boundsInTerrainSpace | The region in Terrain space to edit.  
extraBorderPixels | Number of extra border pixels required.  
fillOutsideTerrain | Whether to fill empty space outside of Terrain tiles with data from the nearest tile.  
  
### Returns

**PaintContext** PaintContext that contains the combined Terrain holes data
for the specified region.

### Description

Helper function to set up a PaintContext for modifying the Terrain holes of
one or more Terrain tiles.

BeginPaintHoles identifies all of the Terrain holes pixels that are within
`extraBorderPixels` of the bounds rectangle. The search is performed across
adjacent connected Terrain tiles. The pixels are collected into a temporary
render texture and stored in
[PaintContext.sourceRenderTexture](TerrainTools.PaintContext-
sourceRenderTexture.html).  
  
After you call this function, you can write new values into
[PaintContext.destinationRenderTexture](TerrainTools.PaintContext-
destinationRenderTexture.html) to modify the Terrain holes. Then, you may
complete the modification by calling
[TerrainPaintUtility.EndPaintHoles](TerrainTools.TerrainPaintUtility.EndPaintHoles.html)
to copy the modified data back to the Terrain tiles. Alteratively, you may
cancel the modification by calling
[TerrainPaintUtility.ReleaseContextResources](TerrainTools.TerrainPaintUtility.ReleaseContextResources.html)
to release the RenderTexture resources.

[TerrainPaintUtility.EndPaintHoles](TerrainTools.TerrainPaintUtility.EndPaintHoles.html)
