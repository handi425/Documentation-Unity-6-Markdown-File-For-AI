public string activeProfileId;

### Description

Gets or sets the ID of the currently active profile.

When active profile is changed all shortcut bindings are updated to reflect
the overrides of active profile and its ancestors profiles. If the active
profile is set to a profile ID of
[ShortcutManager.defaultProfileId](ShortcutManagement.ShortcutManager-
defaultProfileId.html) then all shortcut bindings will return to their default
bindings. Setter throws `ArgumentNullException` if the value is `null`. Setter
throws `ArgumentException` if the given profile ID is not available.
