in the Manual")

## Declaration

public static [Quaternion](Quaternion.html)
RotateTowards([Quaternion](Quaternion.html) from,
[Quaternion](Quaternion.html) to, float maxDegreesDelta);

### Parameters

from | The unit quaternion to be aligned with `to`.  
---|---  
to | The target unit quaternion.  
maxDegreesDelta | The maximum angle in degrees allowed for this rotation.  
  
### Returns

**Quaternion** A unit quaternion rotated towards `to` by an angular step of
`maxDegreesDelta`.

### Description

Rotates a rotation `from` towards `to`.

The `from` quaternion is rotated towards `to` by an angular step of
`maxDegreesDelta`. The rotation will not overshoot the `to` quaternion.
Negative values of `maxDegreesDelta` moves away from `to` until the rotation
is exactly the opposite direction.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        // The object whose rotation we want to match.
        public [Transform](Transform.html) target;  
      
        // Angular speed in degrees per sec.
        public float speed = 1.0f;  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            // The step size is equal to speed times frame time.
            var step = speed * [Time.deltaTime](Time-deltaTime.html);  
      
            // [Rotate](UIElements.Rotate.html) our transform a step closer to the target's.
            transform.rotation = [Quaternion.RotateTowards](Quaternion.RotateTowards.html)(transform.rotation, target.rotation, step);
        }
    }
