## Declaration

public static bool RequiredBone(int i);

### Parameters

i | Index of the bone to test.  
---|---  
  
### Description

Is the bone a member of the minimal set of bones that Mecanim requires for a
human model?

The indexing order of the bones is the same as that used for the
[BoneName](HumanTrait.BoneName.html) array.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            string[] boneName = [HumanTrait.BoneName](HumanTrait.BoneName.html);
            for (int i = 0; i < [HumanTrait.BoneCount](HumanTrait.BoneCount.html); ++i)
            {
                if ([HumanTrait.RequiredBone](HumanTrait.RequiredBone.html)(i))
                    [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)(boneName[i]);
            }
        }
    }
