public int layerOverridePriority;

### Description

A decision priority assigned to this [Collider](Collider.html) used when there
is a conflicting decision on whether a [Collider](Collider.html) can contact
another [Collider](Collider.html).

The Layer Collision Matrix defines which layers can contact other layers.
Additionally, you can include and exclude layers per [Collider](Collider.html)
or for all [Collider](Collider.html)s attached to a specific
[Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html) or [ArticulationBody](ArticulationBody.html). Any
contact involves two different [Collider](Collider.html) instances.
Unfortunately this can result in one [Collider](Collider.html) deciding that
it should contact the other [Collider](Collider.html), but the other
[Collider](Collider.html) deciding it shouldn't. There are rules to decide how
these situations are handled.  
  
The rules for making a decision between two [Collider](Collider.html)s,
referred to here as A and B, are made in the following order:

  1. If both A and B make the same decision then use that decision.
  2. If only A or B are using a layer include or exclude override, then use the decision for A or B that has the include or exclude override specified.
  3. If both A and B are using a layer include or exclude override, then use the decision from A or B that has the higher [Collider.layerOverridePriority](Collider-layerOverridePriority.html).
  4. If A and B have the same [Collider.layerOverridePriority](Collider-layerOverridePriority.html), then the decision will be to not create a contact.
