## Declaration

public static void DrawGUITexture([Rect](Rect.html) screenRect,
[Texture](Texture.html) texture, [Material](Material.html) mat = null);

## Declaration

public static void DrawGUITexture([Rect](Rect.html) screenRect,
[Texture](Texture.html) texture, int leftBorder, int rightBorder, int
topBorder, int bottomBorder, [Material](Material.html) mat = null);

### Parameters

screenRect | The size and position of the texture on the "screen" defined by the XY plane.  
---|---  
texture | The texture to be displayed.  
mat | An optional material to apply the texture.  
leftBorder | Inset from the rectangle's left edge.  
rightBorder | Inset from the rectangle's right edge.  
topBorder | Inset from the rectangle's top edge.  
bottomBorder | Inset from the rectangle's bottom edge.  
  
### Description

Draw a texture in the Scene.

The chosen texture is drawn in 3D space on a "screen" defined by the XY plane
(ie, the plane where the Z coordinate is zero). The values of the texture
rectangle are given in Scene units. The optional border values specify an
inset from each edge within the rectangle in Scene units; the texture is drawn
inside the inset rectangle and the edge pixels are repeated outwards. This is
a useful quick way to create a large background region around the main texture
when its edges are of a single colour.  
  
This function can be useful for creating GUI backgrounds in conjunction with a
camera pointing directly at the texture.

            // Draw a texture rectangle on the XY plane of the scene
            [Gizmos.DrawGUITexture](Gizmos.DrawGUITexture.html)(new [Rect](Rect.html)(10, 10, 20, 20), myTexture);
        }
