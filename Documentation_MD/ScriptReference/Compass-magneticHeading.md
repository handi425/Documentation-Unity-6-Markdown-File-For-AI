public float magneticHeading;

### Description

The heading in degrees relative to the magnetic North Pole. (Read Only)

The value in this property is always measured relative to the top of the
screen in its current orientation. The heading of magnetic north is not
exactly the same as true geographical north - to get the exact heading, use
the [trueHeading](Compass-trueHeading.html) property.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            // Orient an object to point to magnetic north.
            transform.rotation = [Quaternion.Euler](Quaternion.Euler.html)(0, -Input.compass.magneticHeading, 0);
        }
    }
