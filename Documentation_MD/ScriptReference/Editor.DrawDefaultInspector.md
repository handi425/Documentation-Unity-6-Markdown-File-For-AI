## Declaration

public bool DrawDefaultInspector();

### Returns

**bool** Returns true if any GUI controls in the default Inspector changed the
value of the input data, otherwise returns false.

### Description

Draws the built-in Inspector.

Call this method, within the OnInspectorGUI method, to automatically draw the
Inspector. This is useful if you want to add a few buttons without having to
redo the entire Inspector. Additional resources:
[OnInspectorGUI](Editor.OnInspectorGUI.html).

    
    
    // This example shows a custom inspector for an
    // object "MyPlayer", which has a variable speed.
    using UnityEngine;
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);  
      
    class MyPlayer : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        // Hide this field so that it is not shown twice when drawing the default Inspector.
        [[HideInInspector](HideInInspector.html)]
        public float speed;  
      
        public int gear;
    }  
      
    [[CustomEditor](CustomEditor.html)(typeof(MyPlayer))]
    public class Example : [Editor](Editor.html)
    {
        public override void OnInspectorGUI()
        {
            MyPlayer targetPlayer = (MyPlayer)target;
            [EditorGUILayout.LabelField](EditorGUILayout.LabelField.html) ("Some help", "Some other text");  
      
            targetPlayer.speed = [EditorGUILayout.Slider](EditorGUILayout.Slider.html) ("Speed", targetPlayer.speed, 0, 100);  
      
            // Show default inspector property editor
            if(DrawDefaultInspector())
                [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("Gear was changed!");
        }
    }
