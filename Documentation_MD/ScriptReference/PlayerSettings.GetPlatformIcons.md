### Parameters

buildTarget | The [NamedBuildTarget](Build.NamedBuildTarget.html).  
---|---  
kind | Each platform supports a different set of [icon kinds](PlatformIconKind.html). These can be found in the specific platform namespace (for example [iOSPlatformIconKind](iOS.iOSPlatformIconKind.html).

kind](PlatformIconKind.html)."
