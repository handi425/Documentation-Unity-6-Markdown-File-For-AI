## Declaration

public static bool
GetDialogOptOutDecision([DialogOptOutDecisionType](DialogOptOutDecisionType.html)
dialogOptOutDecisionType, string dialogOptOutDecisionStorageKey);

### Parameters

dialogOptOutDecisionType | The type of opt-out decision a user can make.  
---|---  
dialogOptOutDecisionStorageKey | The unique key setting to store the decision under.  
  
### Returns

**bool** `true` if the user previously opted out of seeing the dialog
associated with `dialogOptOutDecisionStorageKey`. Returns `false` if the user
did not yet opt out.

### Description

This method displays a modal dialog that lets the user opt-out of being shown
the current dialog box again.

Use this method as a short-hand to query the opt-out decision a user made on a
dialog displayed via [DisplayDialog](EditorUtility.DisplayDialog.html).  
  
You don't need to query this before you call
[DisplayDialog](EditorUtility.DisplayDialog.html), as Unity handles it
automatically.  
  
If the user chooses to opt-out of a dialog box, Unity stores this decision. If
`dialogOptOutDecisionType` is set to
[DialogOptOutDecisionType.ForThisMachine](DialogOptOutDecisionType.ForThisMachine.html)
Unity stores it via [EditorPrefs.SetBool](EditorPrefs.SetBool.html). If
`dialogOptOutDecisionType` is set to
[DialogOptOutDecisionType.ForThisSession](DialogOptOutDecisionType.ForThisSession.html)
Unity stores it via [SessionState.SetBool](SessionState.SetBool.html). In both
cases Unity stores it under the key provided as
`dialogOptOutDecisionStorageKey`.  
  
This method automatically selects the storage place based on the provided
`dialogOptOutDecisionType`.  
  
If you want to the let the user change their decision that is stored in
[EditorPrefs](EditorUtility.EditorPrefs.html), you can add this to the Editor
Preferences with a [SettingsProvider](EditorUtility.SettingsProvider.html).
