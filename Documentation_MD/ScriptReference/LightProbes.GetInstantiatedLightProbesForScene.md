## Declaration

public static [LightProbes](LightProbes.html)
GetInstantiatedLightProbesForScene([SceneManagement.Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html)
scene);

### Parameters

scene | The scene to get the shared light probe data for.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**LightProbes** The cloned light probe data for the scene.

### Description

Gets an instantiated clone of the `LightProbes` object for a specific scene.

If you modify the `LightProbes` object returned by this method, you will only
affect the lighting of `scene`. Modifications will not affect assets.  
  
**Note** : This function automatically instantiates the `LightProbes` object
and makes it unique to the passed scene. You need to destroy the `LightProbes`
object when it's no longer needed. You can also use
[Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets](Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets.html) to destroy a
`LightProbes` object, which will be called automatically when you switch to a
new scene.
