public [Collider](Collider.html) collider;

### Description

The [Collider](Collider.html) we hit (Read Only).

Fetch the Collider of the GameObject your GameObject hits. To find all
colliders that were hit in detail you have to iterate the contact points
([contacts](Collision-contacts.html) property).

    
    
    //In this example, the name of the [GameObject](GameObject.html) that collides with your [GameObject](GameObject.html) is output to the console. Then this checks the name of the [Collider](Collider.html) and if it matches with the one you specify, it outputs another message.  
      
    //Create a [GameObject](GameObject.html) and make sure it has a [Collider](Collider.html) component. Attach this script to it.
    //Create a second [GameObject](GameObject.html) with a [Collider](Collider.html) and place it on top of the other [GameObject](GameObject.html) to output that there was a collision. You can add movement to the [GameObject](GameObject.html) to test more.  
      
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        //If your [GameObject](GameObject.html) starts to collide with another [GameObject](GameObject.html) with a [Collider](Collider.html)
        void OnCollisionEnter([Collision](Collision.html) collision)
        {
            //Output the [Collider](Collider.html)'s [GameObject](GameObject.html)'s name
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)(collision.collider.name);
        }  
      
        //If your [GameObject](GameObject.html) keeps colliding with another [GameObject](GameObject.html) with a [Collider](Collider.html), do something
        void OnCollisionStay([Collision](Collision.html) collision)
        {
            //Check to see if the [Collider](Collider.html)'s name is "Chest"
            if (collision.collider.name == "Chest")
            {
                //Output the message
                [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("Chest is here!");
            }
        }
    }
