### Description

Signifies that value of this property contains the main color of the Material.

This flag corresponds to the `[MainColor]` [ShaderLab Properties
attribute](../Manual/SL-Properties.html).  
  
By default, Unity considers a color with the property name name `"_Color"` to
be the main color. Use the `[MainColor]` ShaderLab Properties attribute to
make Unity consider a color with a different property name to be the main
color.  
  
Additional resources: [Material.color](Material-color.html), [ShaderLab:
Properties](../Manual/SL-Properties.html),
[ShaderPropertyFlags.MainTexture](Rendering.ShaderPropertyFlags.MainTexture.html).
