## Declaration

protected void
SetupDragAndDrop([IMGUI.Controls.TreeView.SetupDragAndDropArgs](IMGUI.Controls.TreeView.SetupDragAndDropArgs.html)
args);

### Description

This function is called when
[CanStartDrag](IMGUI.Controls.TreeView.CanStartDrag.html) returns true.

Override this function to set the global [DragAndDrop](DragAndDrop.html) state
and set which items can be dragged and dropped. Use
[FindRows](IMGUI.Controls.TreeView.FindRows.html) to convert the dragged IDs
to TreeViewItems if needed.  
  
You control TreeView drag and drop in the following order:  
1) override [CanStartDrag](IMGUI.Controls.TreeView.CanStartDrag.html) to
enable dragging TreeViewItems.  
2) override [SetupDragAndDrop](IMGUI.Controls.TreeView.SetupDragAndDrop.html)
to set which TreeViewItems are dragged.  
3) override
[HandleDragAndDrop](IMGUI.Controls.TreeView.HandleDragAndDrop.html) to control
the drag and drop behavior of the TreeView.  
  
  
Additional resources: [DragAndDrop](DragAndDrop.html).
