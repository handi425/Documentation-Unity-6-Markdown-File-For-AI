### Description

Enables the Editor to handle an event in the Scene view.

In the [OnSceneGUI](Editor.OnSceneGUI.html) you can, for example, edit meshes,
paint terrain, or have advanced gizmos. Refer to the [Handles](Handles.html)
class for methods related to drawing interactable visuals in the
[SceneView](SceneView.html).  
  
If you want to draw elements in the Scene view, for instance by using
`Graphics.DrawMeshNow`, only do so during
[EventType.Repaint](EventType.Repaint.html).  
  
In the following two scripts, [OnSceneGUI](Editor.OnSceneGUI.html) is used to
draw lines between GameObjects. The first script shows how
[OnSceneGUI](Editor.OnSceneGUI.html) is used. In this script, a GameObject is
used as a parent. The script obtains the position of the parent and then draws
lines from that position to GameObjects stored in an array. The script uses
[Handles.DrawLine](Handles.DrawLine.html) to draw lines. The documentation for
[Handles.DrawLine](Handles.DrawLine.html) has a very similar example.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);  
      
    [[CustomEditor](CustomEditor.html)( typeof( DrawLine ) )]
    public class DrawLineEditor : [Editor](Editor.html)
    {
        // Draw lines between a chosen [GameObject](GameObject.html)
        // and a selection of added GameObjects  
      
        void OnSceneGUI()
        {
            // Get the chosen [GameObject](GameObject.html)
            DrawLine t = target as DrawLine;  
      
            if( t == null || t.GameObjects == null )
                return;  
      
            // Grab the center of the parent
            [Vector3](Vector3.html) center = t.transform.position;  
      
            // Iterate over [GameObject](GameObject.html) added to the array...
            for( int i = 0; i < t.GameObjects.Length; i++ )
            {
                // ... and draw a line between them
                if( t.GameObjects[i] != null )
                    [Handles.DrawLine](Handles.DrawLine.html)( center, t.GameObjects[i].transform.position );
            }
        }
    }
    

This script stores the array of GameObjects which have a line drawn to them.
This regular script is attached to a GameObject which is considered to be the
starting point for all lines.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    [[ExecuteInEditMode](ExecuteInEditMode.html)]
    public class DrawLine : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        // an array of game objects which will have a
        // line drawn to in the [Scene](SceneManagement.Scene.html) editor
        public [GameObject](GameObject.html)[] GameObjects;
    }
