## Declaration

public [Search.QueryFilterOperator](Search.QueryFilterOperator.html)
AddOperator(string op);

### Parameters

op | The operator identifier.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**QueryFilterOperator** The added, or existing,
[QueryFilterOperator](Search.QueryFilterOperator.html).

### Description

Add a custom filter operator specific to the filter.

Custom operators defined on a filter take precedence over operators defined
globally on the [QueryEngine](Search.QueryEngine_1.html). This is useful if
you wish to have a custom operator only for a specific filter, or if you wish
to override the default behavior of a built-in operator for a specific filter.
If the operator already exists, the existing operator is returned.

    
    
    // Override global operators with specific operator handlers for this filter
    filter.AddOperator("=").AddHandler(([Vector2](Vector2.html) ev, [Vector2](Vector2.html) fv) => ev == fv);
    filter.AddOperator("!=").AddHandler(([Vector2](Vector2.html) ev, [Vector2](Vector2.html) fv) => ev != fv);
    

See [IQueryEngineFilter](Search.IQueryEngineFilter.html) for a complete
example.
