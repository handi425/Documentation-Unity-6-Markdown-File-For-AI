## Declaration

public [RaycastHit2D](RaycastHit2D.html) Raycast([Vector2](Vector2.html)
origin, [Vector2](Vector2.html) direction, float distance, int layerMask =
Physics2D.DefaultRaycastLayers);

## Declaration

public [RaycastHit2D](RaycastHit2D.html) Raycast([Vector2](Vector2.html)
origin, [Vector2](Vector2.html) direction, float distance,
[ContactFilter2D](ContactFilter2D.html) contactFilter);

### Parameters

origin | The point in 2D space where the ray originates.  
---|---  
direction | The vector representing the direction of the ray.  
distance | Maximum distance over which to cast the ray.  
layerMask | The filter used to detect Colliders only on certain layers.  
contactFilter | The contact filter used to filter the results differently, such as by layer mask and Z depth, or normal angle.  
  
### Returns

**RaycastHit2D** The cast results returned.

### Description

Casts a ray against colliders in the PhysicsScene2D, returning the first
intersection only.

A _raycast_ is conceptually like a laser beam that is fired from a point in
space along a particular direction. Any object making contact with the beam
can be detected and reported. Raycasts are useful for determining lines of
sight, targets hit by gunfire and for many other purposes in gameplay.  
  
This function returns a [RaycastHit2D](RaycastHit2D.html) object with a
reference to the [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) that is hit by the ray (the
collider property of the result will be NULL if nothing was hit).  
  
The _layerMask_ can be used to detect objects selectively only on certain
layers (this allows you to apply the detection only to enemy characters, for
example). Overloads of this method that use `contactFilter` can filter the
results by the options available in [ContactFilter2D](ContactFilter2D.html).  
  
Additionally, this will also detect collider(s) at the start of the ray. In
this case, the ray starts inside the collider and doesn't intersect the
collider surface. This means that the collision normal cannot be calculated,
in which case the returned collision normal is set to the inverse of the ray
vector being tested. This can easily be detected because such results are
always at a RaycastHit2D fraction of zero.

## Declaration

public int Raycast([Vector2](Vector2.html) origin, [Vector2](Vector2.html)
direction, float distance, [ContactFilter2D](ContactFilter2D.html)
contactFilter, RaycastHit2D[] results);

### Parameters

origin | The point in 2D space where the ray originates.  
---|---  
direction | The vector representing the direction of the ray.  
distance | Maximum distance over which to cast the ray.  
layerMask | The filter used to detect Colliders only on certain layers.  
contactFilter | The contact filter used to filter the results differently, such as by layer mask and Z depth, or normal angle.  
results | The array to receive results. The size of the array determines the maximum number of results that can be returned.  
  
### Returns

**int** Returns the number of results placed in the `results` array.

### Description

Casts a ray against colliders the PhysicsScene2D, returning all intersections.

A _raycast_ is conceptually like a laser beam that is fired from a point in
space along a particular direction. Any object making contact with the beam
can be detected and reported. Raycasts are useful for determining lines of
sight, targets hit by gunfire and for many other purposes in gameplay.  
  
This function returns any [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) that intersect the ray
with the results returned in the supplied array. The integer return value is
the number of objects that intersect the line (possibly zero) but the results
array will not be resized if it doesn't contain enough elements to report all
the results. The significance of this is that no memory is allocated for the
results and so garbage collection performance is improved. Note that you will
always get zero results if you pass an empty array.  
  
The _layerMask_ can be used to detect objects selectively only on certain
layers (this allows you to apply the detection only to enemy characters, for
example). Overloads of this method that use `contactFilter` can filter the
results by the options available in [ContactFilter2D](ContactFilter2D.html).  
  
Additionally, this will also detect collider(s) at the start of the ray. In
this case, the ray starts inside the collider and doesn't intersect the
collider surface. This means that the collision normal cannot be calculated,
in which case the returned collision normal is set to the inverse of the ray
vector being tested. This can easily be detected because such results are
always at a RaycastHit2D fraction of zero.  
  
All results are sorted by ascending distance order.

## Declaration

public int Raycast([Vector2](Vector2.html) origin, [Vector2](Vector2.html)
direction, float distance, [ContactFilter2D](ContactFilter2D.html)
contactFilter, List<RaycastHit2D> results);

### Parameters

origin | The point in 2D space where the ray originates.  
---|---  
direction | The vector representing the direction of the ray.  
distance | Maximum distance over which to cast the ray.  
contactFilter | The contact filter used to filter the results differently, such as by layer mask and Z depth, or normal angle.  
results | The list to receive results.  
  
### Returns

**int** Returns the number of results placed in the `results` list.

### Description

Casts a ray against Colliders the PhysicsScene2D, returning all intersections.

A _raycast_ is conceptually like a laser beam that is fired from a point in
space along a particular direction. Any object making contact with the beam
can be detected and reported. Raycasts are useful for determining lines of
sight, targets hit by gunfire and for many other purposes in gameplay.  
  
The integer return value is the number of results written into the `results`
list. The results list will be resized if it doesn't contain enough elements
to report all the results. This prevents memory from being allocated for
results when the `results` list does not need to be resized, and improves
garbage collection performance when the query is performed frequently.  
  
The results can also be filtered by the `contactFilter`. All results are
sorted by ascending distance order.
