## Declaration

public static [RaycastHit2D](RaycastHit2D.html)
Linecast([Vector2](Vector2.html) start, [Vector2](Vector2.html) end, int
layerMask = DefaultRaycastLayers, float minDepth = -Mathf.Infinity, float
maxDepth = Mathf.Infinity);

### Parameters

start | The start point of the line in world space.  
---|---  
end | The end point of the line in world space.  
layerMask | Filter to detect Colliders only on certain layers.  
minDepth | Only include objects with a Z coordinate (depth) greater than or equal to this value.  
maxDepth | Only include objects with a Z coordinate (depth) less than or equal to this value.  
  
### Returns

**RaycastHit2D** The cast results returned.

### Description

Casts a line segment against Colliders in the Scene.

A _linecast_ is an imaginary line between two points in world space. Any
object making contact with this line can be detected and reported. This
differs from the similar _raycast_ in that raycasting specifies the line using
an origin and direction.  
  
This function returns a RaycastHit2D object when the line contacts a Collider
in the Scene. The _layerMask_ can be used to detect objects selectively only
on certain layers (this allows you to apply the detection only to enemy
characters, for example). The direction of the line is assumed to extend from
the start point to the end point. Only the first Collider encountered in that
direction will be reported. Although the Z axis is not relevant for rendering
or collisions in 2D, you can use the _minDepth_ and _maxDepth_ parameters to
filter objects based on their Z coordinate.  
  
Linecasts are useful for determining lines of sight, targets hit by gunfire
and for many other purposes in gameplay.  
  
Note that this function will allocate memory for the returned RaycastHit2D
object. You can use [LinecastNonAlloc](Physics2D.LinecastNonAlloc.html) to
avoid this overhead if you need to make linecasts frequently.  
  
Additionally, this will also detect Collider(s) at the start of the line. In
this case the line is starting inside the Collider and doesn't intersect the
Collider surface. This means that the collision normal cannot be calculated in
which case the collision normal returned is set to the inverse of the line
vector being tested. This can easily be detected because such results are
always at a RaycastHit2D fraction of zero.

## Declaration

public static int Linecast([Vector2](Vector2.html) start,
[Vector2](Vector2.html) end, [ContactFilter2D](ContactFilter2D.html)
contactFilter, RaycastHit2D[] results);

### Parameters

start | The start point of the line in world space.  
---|---  
end | The end point of the line in world space.  
contactFilter | The contact filter used to filter the results differently, such as by layer mask, Z depth, or normal angle.  
results | The array to receive results. The size of the array determines the maximum number of results that can be returned.  
  
### Returns

**int** Returns the number of results placed in the `results` array.

### Description

Casts a line segment against Colliders in the Scene with results filtered by
[ContactFilter2D](ContactFilter2D.html).

The overloads of this function with the `contactFilter` parameter can filter
the returned results by the options in
[ContactFilter2D](ContactFilter2D.html).

## Declaration

public static int Linecast([Vector2](Vector2.html) start,
[Vector2](Vector2.html) end, [ContactFilter2D](ContactFilter2D.html)
contactFilter, List<RaycastHit2D> results);

### Parameters

start | The start point of the line in world space.  
---|---  
end | The end point of the line in world space.  
contactFilter | The contact filter used to filter the results differently, such as by layer mask, Z depth, or normal angle.  
results | The list to receive results.  
  
### Returns

**int** Returns the number of results placed in the `results` list.

### Description

Casts a line segment against Colliders in the Scene with results filtered by
[ContactFilter2D](ContactFilter2D.html).

The integer return value is the number of results written into the `results`
list. The results list will be resized if it doesn't contain enough elements
to report all the results. This prevents memory from being allocated for
results when the `results` list does not need to be resized, and improves
garbage collection performance when the query is performed frequently.  
  
The results can also be filtered by the `contactFilter`.
