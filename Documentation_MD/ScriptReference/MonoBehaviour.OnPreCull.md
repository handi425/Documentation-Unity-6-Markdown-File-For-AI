[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-MonoBehaviour.html "Go to MonoBehaviour
Component in the Manual")

### Description

[Event function](../Manual/event-functions.html) that Unity calls before a
[Camera](Camera.html) culls the scene.

In the Built-in Render Pipeline, Unity calls `OnPreCull` on MonoBehaviours
that are attached to the same GameObject as an enabled [Camera](Camera.html)
component, just before that Camera performs the culling operation that
determines what it can see. Use `OnPreCull` to execute your own code at this
point in the render loop; for example, you can change the Camera's settings
before performing the culling operation, to affect what the Camera sees.
`OnPreCull` can be a coroutine.  
  
For similar functionality that does not require the script to be on the same
GameObject as a Camera component, see [Camera.onPreCull](Camera-
onPreCull.html). For similar functionality in the Scriptable Render Pipeline,
see [RenderPipelineManager](Rendering.RenderPipelineManager.html).

    
    
    // Attach this to the same [GameObject](GameObject.html) as a [Camera](Camera.html) component.
    // This script inverts the view of the [Camera](Camera.html), so that everything rendered by it is flipped  
      
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        [Camera](Camera.html) cam;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            cam = GetComponent<[Camera](Camera.html)>();
        }  
      
        void OnPreCull()
        {
            cam.ResetWorldToCameraMatrix();
            cam.ResetProjectionMatrix();
            cam.projectionMatrix = cam.projectionMatrix * [Matrix4x4.Scale](Matrix4x4.Scale.html)(new [Vector3](Vector3.html)(1, -1, 1));
        }  
      
        void OnPreRender()
        {
            [GL.invertCulling](GL-invertCulling.html) = true;
        }  
      
        void OnPostRender()
        {
            [GL.invertCulling](GL-invertCulling.html) = false;
        }
    }
