### Description

The type of the connected target.

Used in [IConnectionState](Networking.PlayerConnection.IConnectionState.html).
For example, this is used to signify whether the Editor is connected to a
Player, or to an Editor. When the Editor is connected to another Editor or
itself, it also picks up the PlayMode Player. If the Editor is not connected
to a Player, it always falls back onto a connection to itself. Therefore,
[ConnectionTarget.None](Networking.PlayerConnection.ConnectionTarget.None.html)
is only applicable in a Player.

### Properties

[None](Networking.PlayerConnection.ConnectionTarget.None.html)| No target is
connected, this is only possible in a Player.  
---|---  
[Player](Networking.PlayerConnection.ConnectionTarget.Player.html)| The
connected target is a Player.  
[Editor](Networking.PlayerConnection.ConnectionTarget.Editor.html)| The
connected target is an Editor.
