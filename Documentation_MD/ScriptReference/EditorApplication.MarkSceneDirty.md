**Obsolete** Use EditorSceneManager.MarkSceneDirty or
EditorSceneManager.MarkAllScenesDirty.

## Declaration

public static void MarkSceneDirty();

### Description

Explicitly mark the current opened Scene as modified.

Normally, an operation resulting in a Scene file change should register itself
with the undo system, which automatically handles Scene dirty state tracking.
However, if for whatever reason you can't make the operation undoable, you can
use this function to explicitly mark the Scene as modified, so that the user
will be prompted to save the Scene when it's being closed.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
**Known Issue**. Please check with the Issue Tracker at
