## Declaration

public static bool SphereCast([Vector3](Vector3.html) origin, float radius,
[Vector3](Vector3.html) direction, out [RaycastHit](RaycastHit.html) hitInfo,
float maxDistance = Mathf.Infinity, int layerMask = DefaultRaycastLayers,
[QueryTriggerInteraction](QueryTriggerInteraction.html)
queryTriggerInteraction = QueryTriggerInteraction.UseGlobal);

### Parameters

origin | The center of the sphere at the start of the sweep.  
---|---  
radius | The radius of the sphere.  
direction | The direction into which to sweep the sphere.  
hitInfo | If true is returned, `hitInfo` will contain more information about where the collider was hit. (Additional resources: [RaycastHit](RaycastHit.html)).  
maxDistance | The max length of the cast.  
layerMask | A [Layer mask](../Manual/Layers.html) that is used to selectively ignore colliders when casting a capsule.  
queryTriggerInteraction | Specifies whether this query should hit Triggers.  
  
### Returns

**bool** True when the sphere sweep intersects any collider, otherwise false.

### Description

Casts a sphere along a ray and returns detailed information on what was hit.

This is useful when a Raycast does not give enough precision, because you want
to find out if an object of a specific size, such as a character, will be able
to move somewhere without colliding with anything on the way. Think of the
sphere cast like a thick raycast. In this case the ray is specified by a start
vector and a direction.  
  
**Notes:** SphereCast will not detect colliders for which the sphere overlaps
the collider. Passing a zero radius results in undefined output and doesn't
always behave the same as [Physics.Raycast](Physics.Raycast.html).

            float distanceToObstacle = 0;  
      
            // Cast a sphere wrapping character controller 10 meters forward
            // to see if it is about to hit anything.
            if ([Physics.SphereCast](Physics.SphereCast.html)(p1, charCtrl.height / 2, transform.forward, out hit, 10))
            {
                distanceToObstacle = hit.distance;
            }
        }
