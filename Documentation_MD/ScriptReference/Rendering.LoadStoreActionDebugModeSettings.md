### Description

Whether to show undefined areas of the display that might cause rendering
problems in your built application.

If you create a [RenderTexture](RenderTexture.html), it might have undefined
('invalidated') pixels. Rendering to the render texture might fail or produce
artefacts, because undefined pixels in the [depth texture](../Manual/SL-
CameraDepthTexture.html) cause depth testing to fail.  
  
Undefined pixels can be caused by the following:

  * You don't load the previous frame into the render texture - for example, because you use [RenderBufferLoadAction.DontCare](Rendering.RenderBufferLoadAction.DontCare.html)
  * For performance reasons, the platform or API doesn't load the previous frame into the render texture - for example, on mobile platforms or the Vulkan graphics API.
  * You use [RenderBufferStoreAction.DontCare](Rendering.RenderBufferStoreAction.DontCare.html), [RenderBufferStoreAction.Resolve](Rendering.RenderBufferStoreAction.Resolve.html) or [RenderTexture.DiscardContents](RenderTexture.DiscardContents.html) to discard the render buffer's contents after rendering.
  * You don't initialize the render texture after you [create](RenderTexture.Create.html) it.

If you set `LoadStoreActionDebugModeSettings.LoadStoreDebugModeEnabled` to
`true`, Unity highlights undefined areas with `INVALIDATED`. The highlights
appear only in the Game view, and your built application if you select
**Development Build** in [Build settings](../Manual/BuildSettings.html).

In the image above, the cube on the right has failed depth testing and might
not render in your built application, so Unity highlights the area with
`INVALIDATED`. The cube on the left ignores depth testing and renders
correctly.  
  
You shouldn't enable this parameter if you're profiling your project, because
it might reduce rendering performance.  
  
You can also control this setting in [Player settings](../Manual/class-
PlayerSettings.html). You can use the API at runtime to override the value in
Player settings, but Unity resets the value if you restart Play Mode or build
your project.  
  
You can fix undefined areas in the following ways:

  * Check you use the correct [RenderBufferLoadAction](Rendering.RenderBufferLoadAction.html) and [RenderBufferStoreAction](Rendering.RenderBufferStoreAction.html).
  * Check you initialize your render texture - for example, you use [GL.Clear](GL.Clear.html) or [CommandBuffer.ClearRenderTarget](Rendering.CommandBuffer.ClearRenderTarget.html).
  * Use [ZTest Always](../Manual/SL-ZTest.html) in shaders you use in Materials and [Graphics.Blit](Graphics.Blit.html).

### Static Properties
