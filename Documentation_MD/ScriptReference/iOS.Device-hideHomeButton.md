public static bool hideHomeButton;

### Description

Specifies whether the home button should be hidden in the iOS build of this
application.

On iPhone X the home button is implemented as a system gesture (swipe up from
the bottom edge of the screen). The location of this virtual button is
indicated by a white bar. If this setting is enabled, the home button is
hidden from view whenever the user has not touched the screen for several
seconds. Note that iOS Human interface guidelines do not recommend enabling
this behavior for applications not containing passive viewing experiences such
as viewing a video or a photo slideshow. The initial value of this setting is
defined by `PlayerSettings.iOS.hideHomeButton`.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
**Known Issue**. Please check with the Issue Tracker at
