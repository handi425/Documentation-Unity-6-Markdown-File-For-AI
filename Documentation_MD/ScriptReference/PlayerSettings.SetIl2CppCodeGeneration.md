## Declaration

public static void
SetIl2CppCodeGeneration([Build.NamedBuildTarget](Build.NamedBuildTarget.html)
buildTarget, [Build.Il2CppCodeGeneration](Build.Il2CppCodeGeneration.html)
value);

### Parameters

buildTarget | The [NamedBuildTarget](Build.NamedBuildTarget.html).  
---|---  
value | Code generation option.  
  
### Description

Sets the code generation option for IL2CPP for the specified build target.

There are two options for IL2CPP code generation.
[Il2CppCodeGeneration.OptimizeSpeed](Build.Il2CppCodeGeneration.OptimizeSpeed.html)
generates code that is optimized for runtime performance. This is the default
and the behavior in previous versions of Unity.
[Il2CppCodeGeneration.OptimizeSize](Build.Il2CppCodeGeneration.OptimizeSize.html)
generates code that is optimized for build size and iteration. It generates
less code and produces a smaller build but may have an impact on runtime
performance, especially for generic code. You should consider this option when
faster build times are important, such as when iterating on changes.  
  
Additionally,
[Il2CppCodeGeneration.OptimizeSize](Build.Il2CppCodeGeneration.OptimizeSize.html)
generates a universal version of each generic type and method. This avoids
some restrictions
[Il2CppCodeGeneration.OptimizeSpeed](Build.Il2CppCodeGeneration.OptimizeSpeed.html)
has when executing generic code.
