[Experimental.Audio.AudioSampleProvider.ConsumeSampleFramesNativeFunction](Experimental.Audio.AudioSampleProvider.ConsumeSampleFramesNativeFunction.html)
consumeSampleFramesNativeFunction;

### Description

Pointer to the native function that provides access to audio sample frames.

This function pointer can be passed to native plug-ins that need to consume
sample frames while avoiding any overhead related to going from native to C#
or garbage collection interference.  
  
Importing a native function that uses this type, for passing the native
function pointer to the native plugin, would look like this:

    
    
    SetConsumeSampleFramesFunction(
        [AudioSampleProvider.consumeSampleFramesNativeFunction](Experimental.Audio.AudioSampleProvider-consumeSampleFramesNativeFunction.html), signalProvider.id,
        signalProvider.channelCount, signalProvider.sampleRate);
    

See
[ConsumeSampleFramesNativeFunction](Experimental.Audio.AudioSampleProvider.ConsumeSampleFramesNativeFunction.html)
for how to import a native function that uses this signature.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
