Manual")

public Color32[] colors32;

### Description

Vertex colors of the Mesh.

Same as [colors](Mesh-colors.html), except using [Color32](Color32.html)
structure is better for performance.  
  
**Note:** The [Mesh.colors32](Mesh-colors32.html) array has to be modified or
created externally from the Mesh. See, for example, the note on the [uv](Mesh-
uv.html) page.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
**Known Issue**. Please check with the Issue Tracker at
