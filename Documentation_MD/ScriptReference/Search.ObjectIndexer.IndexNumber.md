## Declaration

public void IndexNumber(int documentIndex, string name, double number);

### Parameters

documentIndex | Document where the indexed value was found.  
---|---  
name | Key used to retrieve the value.  
number | Number value to store in the index.  
  
### Description

Adds a key-number value pair to the index. The key won't be added with
variations.

The following example uses `IndexNumber` to index a number `testsize` property
that can be searched using common number operators such as `>=`, i.e.
`testsize>=4.2`.

    
    
    [CustomObjectIndexer(typeof([Collider](Collider.html)), version = 3)]
    static void IndexObjectSize([CustomObjectIndexerTarget](Search.CustomObjectIndexerTarget.html) target, [ObjectIndexer](Search.ObjectIndexer.html) indexer)
    {
        var collider = target.target as [Collider](Collider.html);
        if (collider == null)
            return;
    
        var totalSize = CustomSelectors.ComputeColliderSize(collider);
        indexer.IndexNumber(target.documentIndex, "collidersize", totalSize);
    }
