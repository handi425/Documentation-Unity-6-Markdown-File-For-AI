public static int constantBufferOffsetAlignment;

### Description

Minimum buffer offset (in bytes) when binding a constant buffer using
Shader.SetConstantBuffer or
[Material.SetConstantBuffer](Material.SetConstantBuffer.html).

If the currently active renderer supports binding constant buffers directly
(see [SystemInfo.supportsSetConstantBuffer](SystemInfo-
supportsSetConstantBuffer.html)), and supports binding constant buffers with
an offset, this property specifies the minimum required alignment in bytes for
the offset parameter given to Shader.SetConstantBuffer etc. If this property
is 0, the current renderer only supports binding constant buffers at offset 0
(for example, DX11 devices that do not expose DX11.1 features).

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
