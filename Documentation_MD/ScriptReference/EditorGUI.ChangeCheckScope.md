### Description

Check if any control was changed inside a block of code.

When needing to check if [GUI.changed](GUI-changed.html) is set to true inside
a block of code, wrap the code inside a ChangeCheckScope like this:

    
    
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);  
      
    class ExampleClass
    {
        void ExampleMethod()
        {
            using (var check = new [EditorGUI.ChangeCheckScope](EditorGUI.ChangeCheckScope.html)())
            {
                // [Block](Unity.Android.Gradle.Block.html) of code with controls
                // that may set [GUI.changed](GUI-changed.html) to true  
      
                if (check.changed)
                {
                    // Code to execute if [GUI.changed](GUI-changed.html)
                    // was set to true inside the block of code above.
                }
            }
        }
    }
