## Declaration

public void SetGlobalInteger(string name, int value);

### Description

Adds a command to set the value of a given property for all Shaders, where the
property is an integer.

When Unity executes the CommandBuffer, it sets the value of the given property
for all Shaders. The effect is as the same as calling
[Shader.SetGlobalInteger](Shader.SetGlobalInteger.html).  
  
For properties that use the legacy ShaderLab type `Int`, which are internally
represented as floats, use
[SetGlobalInt](Rendering.CommandBuffer.SetGlobalInt.html).
