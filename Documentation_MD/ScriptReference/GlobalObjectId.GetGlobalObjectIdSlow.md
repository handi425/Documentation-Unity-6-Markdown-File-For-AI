## Declaration

public static [GlobalObjectId](GlobalObjectId.html)
GetGlobalObjectIdSlow([Object](Object.html) targetObject);

### Parameters

targetObject | The object to obtain the unique identifier for.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**GlobalObjectId** The `GlobalObjectId` for the object. If the conversion is
unsuccessful, then the `GlobalObjectId` is set to the default null ID. The
null ID has the string representation
`GlobalObjectId_V1-0-00000000000000000000000000000000-0-0`

### Description

Obtains the unique object identifiers based on an object reference.

This method is slow. Use it sparingly. To get unique identifiers for multiple
objects, it's recommended to use
[GlobalObjectId.GetGlobalObjectIdsSlow](GlobalObjectId.GetGlobalObjectIdsSlow.html)
instead of making multiple calls to this method. If you use this method in a
large project within other performance-sensitive contexts such as
[ISerializationCallbackReceiver.OnBeforeSerialize](ISerializationCallbackReceiver.OnBeforeSerialize.html)
or
[ISerializationCallbackReceiver.OnAfterDeserialize](ISerializationCallbackReceiver.OnAfterDeserialize.html),
it's strongly recommended to profile the performance impact.

[GlobalObjectId.GetGlobalObjectIdsSlow](GlobalObjectId.GetGlobalObjectIdsSlow.html),
[Object.GetInstanceID](Object.GetInstanceID.html)

## Declaration

public static [GlobalObjectId](GlobalObjectId.html) GetGlobalObjectIdSlow(int
instanceId);

### Parameters

instanceId | The instance ID of the object to obtain the unique identifier for.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**GlobalObjectId** The `GlobalObjectId` for the object. If the conversion is
unsuccessful, then the `GlobalObjectId` is set to the default null ID. The
null ID has the string representation
`GlobalObjectId_V1-0-00000000000000000000000000000000-0-0`
