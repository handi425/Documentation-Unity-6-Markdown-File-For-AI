## Declaration

public void DirtyTextureRegion(string textureName, [RectInt](RectInt.html)
region, bool allowDelayedCPUSync);

### Parameters

textureName | The name of the Terrain texture.  
---|---  
region | The rectangular region to mark as dirty.  
allowDelayedCPUSync | Specifies whether to allow delayed CPU synchronization of the texture.  
  
### Description

Marks the specified part of the Terrain texture as dirty.

Use this function only after you manually change the GPU part of the Terrain
texture, such as by using [Graphics.CopyTexture](Graphics.CopyTexture.html).
Set the `allowDelayedCPUSync` parameter to `true` if you want Unity to perform
immediate synchronization of the CPU part. If you set it to `false`, Unity
queues the reading back of the dirty region until the next call to
[SyncTexture](TerrainData.SyncTexture.html).  
  
If the current active [RenderTexture](RenderTexture.html) contains your
changes, and you want to copy a part of it into the Terrain texture, use
[CopyActiveRenderTextureToTexture](TerrainData.CopyActiveRenderTextureToTexture.html)
instead.
