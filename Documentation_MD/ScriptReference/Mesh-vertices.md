[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-Mesh.html "Go to Mesh Component in the
Manual")

public Vector3[] vertices;

### Description

Returns a copy of the vertex positions or assigns a new vertex positions
array.

The number of vertices in the Mesh is changed by assigning a vertex array with
a different number of vertices.  
  
If you resize the vertex array then all other vertex attributes (normals,
colors, tangents, UVs) are automatically resized too.
[RecalculateBounds](Mesh.RecalculateBounds.html) is automatically invoked if
no vertices have been assigned to the Mesh when setting the vertices.  
  
Note that this method returns the vertices in local space, not in world space.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        [Mesh](Mesh.html) mesh;
        [Vector3](Vector3.html)[] vertices;
        void Start()
        {
            mesh = GetComponent<[MeshFilter](MeshFilter.html)>().mesh;
            vertices = mesh.vertices;
        }  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            for (var i = 0; i < vertices.Length; i++)
            {
                vertices[i] += [Vector3.up](Vector3-up.html) * [Time.deltaTime](Time-deltaTime.html);
            }  
      
            // assign the local vertices array into the vertices array of the [Mesh](Mesh.html).
            mesh.vertices = vertices;
            mesh.RecalculateBounds();
        }
    }
    

**Note:** To make changes to the [vertices](Mesh-vertices.html) it is
important to copy the vertices from the [Mesh](Mesh.html). Once the
[vertices](Mesh-vertices.html) have been copied and changed the
[vertices](Mesh-vertices.html) can be reassigned back to the
[Mesh](Mesh.html).
