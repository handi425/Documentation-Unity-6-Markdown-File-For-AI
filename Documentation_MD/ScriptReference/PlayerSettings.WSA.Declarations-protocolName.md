Component in the Manual")

public static string protocolName;

### Description

A URI scheme to register the application as a default handler for.

Windows uses URI schemes to launch the application when the user clicks
hyperlinks that match the URI scheme.  
If you register the application as a URI scheme handler, then it also [handles
URI activation events](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/launch-
resume/handle-uri-activation#step-3-handle-the-activated-event).  
In the Editor, Unity displays this under **File and Protocol Associations** in
[UWP Player Settings](../Manual/class-PlayerSettingsWSA.html). For information
on Windows URI activation, see [Microsoft's
documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/launch-
resume/launch-app-with-uri).

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
