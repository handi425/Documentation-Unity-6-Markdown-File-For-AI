public [Vector3](Vector3.html) rotationRateUnbiased;

### Description

Returns unbiased rotation rate as measured by the device's gyroscope.

The rotation rate is given as a Vector3 representing the speed of rotation
around each of the three axes in radians per second. This value has been
processed to remove "bias" and give a more accurate measurement. The raw value
reported by the gyroscope hardware can be obtained with the
[rotationRate](Gyroscope-rotationRate.html) property.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public float shakeSpeed;
        public [AudioClip](AudioClip.html) shakeSound;
        [AudioSource](AudioSource.html) audioSource;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            audioSource = GetComponent<[AudioSource](AudioSource.html)>();
        }  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            if (Input.gyro.rotationRateUnbiased.y > shakeSpeed && !audioSource.isPlaying)
                audioSource.PlayOneShot(shakeSound);
        }
    }
