### Description

Records profiling data produced by a specific Sampler.

Recorder accumulates elapsed time of every Begin/End pair during a frame. Once
enabled it sums delta time between Begin and End samples produced by a
Sampler. Use [elapsedNanoseconds](Profiling.Recorder-elapsedNanoseconds.html)
to get the accumulated time for the previous frame.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.Profiling;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        [Recorder](Profiling.Recorder.html) behaviourUpdateRecorder;
        void Start()
        {
            behaviourUpdateRecorder = [Recorder.Get](Profiling.Recorder.Get.html)("BehaviourUpdate");
            behaviourUpdateRecorder.enabled = true;
        }  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            if (behaviourUpdateRecorder.isValid)
                [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("BehaviourUpdate time: " + behaviourUpdateRecorder.elapsedNanoseconds);
        }
    }
    

**Note:** A Recorder collects data regardless of the Profiler state. When a
Recorder is enabled, data is accumulated every time its Sampler is hit. This
information is equivalent to the one you can see in Hierarchy view in the
[Profiler Window](../Manual/ProfilerCPU.html).  
  
At the moment Samplers are available only in the Editor and Development
Players. Use [Recorder.isValid](Profiling.Recorder-isValid.html) to verify if
Recorder can collect the data.  
  
Recorder supports only internal static Profiler labels and labels generated by
[CustomSampler](Profiling.CustomSampler.html). Dynamic internal labels
produced by scripting method calls and labels produced by
[Profiler.BeginSample](Profiling.Profiler.BeginSample.html) are not supported.  
  
Additional resources: [Sampler](Profiling.Sampler.html),
[Recorder.isValid](Profiling.Recorder-isValid.html),
[Recorder.elapsedNanoseconds](Profiling.Recorder-elapsedNanoseconds.html).

### Properties

[elapsedNanoseconds](Profiling.Recorder-elapsedNanoseconds.html)| Accumulated
time of Begin/End pairs for the previous frame in nanoseconds. (Read Only)  
---|---  
[enabled](Profiling.Recorder-enabled.html)| Enables recording.  
[gpuElapsedNanoseconds](Profiling.Recorder-gpuElapsedNanoseconds.html)| Gets
the accumulated GPU time, in nanoseconds, for a frame. The Recorder has a
three frame delay so this gives the timings for the frame that was three
frames before the one that you access this property on. (Read Only).  
[gpuSampleBlockCount](Profiling.Recorder-gpuSampleBlockCount.html)| Gets the
number of Begin/End time pairs that the GPU executed during a frame. The
Recorder has a three frame delay so this gives the timings for the frame that
was three frames before the one that you access this property on. (Read Only).  
[isValid](Profiling.Recorder-isValid.html)| Returns true if Recorder is valid
and can collect data. (Read Only)  
[sampleBlockCount](Profiling.Recorder-sampleBlockCount.html)| Number of time
Begin/End pairs was called during the previous frame. (Read Only)  
  
### Public Methods

[CollectFromAllThreads](Profiling.Recorder.CollectFromAllThreads.html)|
Configures the recorder to collect samples from all threads.  
---|---  
[FilterToCurrentThread](Profiling.Recorder.FilterToCurrentThread.html)|
Configures the recorder to only collect data from the current thread.  
  
### Static Methods

[Get](Profiling.Recorder.Get.html)| Use this function to get a Recorder for
the specific Profiler label.
