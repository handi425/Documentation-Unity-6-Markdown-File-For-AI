### Description

Container for holding information about a serialized file to be written.

Note: this class and its members exist to provide low-level support for the
**Scriptable Build Pipeline** package. This is intended for internal use only;
use the [Scriptable Build Pipeline
package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.scriptablebuildpipeline@latest/index.html)
to implement a fully featured build pipeline. You can install this via the
[Unity Package Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.package-
manager-ui@latest/index.html).

### Properties

[fileName](Build.Content.WriteCommand-fileName.html)| Final file name on disk
of the serialized file.  
---|---  
[internalName](Build.Content.WriteCommand-internalName.html)| Internal name
used by the loading system for a serialized file.  
[serializeObjects](Build.Content.WriteCommand-serializeObjects.html)| List of
objects and their order contained inside a serialized file.  
  
### Constructors
