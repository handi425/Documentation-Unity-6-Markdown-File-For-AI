### Parameters

id | The identifier that was used to submit an array of positions to be baked.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**void** True if outBakedProbeSH and outBakedProbeValidity could be
successfully returned.

### Description

Retrieve the bake result of additional probes.

Additional baked probes are probes that can be baked independently of any
Light Probe Groups. The baked probe data contains spherical harmonic L2
coefficients as well as a single float value to determine the validity of each
probe. By setting an array of probe positions with an identifier, a successive
bake will produce probe results for these positions, which can then be fetched
again from the API using the identifier.
