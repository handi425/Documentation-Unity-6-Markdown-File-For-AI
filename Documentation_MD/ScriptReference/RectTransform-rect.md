[ ]()

public [Rect](Rect.html) rect;

### Description

The calculated rectangle in the local space of the
[Transform](Transform.html).

Unity automatically attaches these to UI elements. Manipulate aspects of the
rectangle in the Inspector such as the position, dimensions, rotation, and
scale. This is read-only in a script.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        [RectTransform](RectTransform.html) rectTransform;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            //Fetch the [RectTransform](RectTransform.html) from the [GameObject](GameObject.html)
            rectTransform = GetComponent<[RectTransform](RectTransform.html)>();
        }  
      
        void OnGUI()
        {
            //The [Label](UIElements.Label.html) shows the current [Rect](Rect.html) settings on the screen
            [GUI.Label](GUI.Label.html)(new [Rect](Rect.html)(20, 20, 150, 80), "[Rect](Rect.html) : " + rectTransform.rect);
        }
    }
