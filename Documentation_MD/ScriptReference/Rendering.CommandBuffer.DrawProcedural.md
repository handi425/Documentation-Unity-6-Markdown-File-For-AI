## Declaration

public void DrawProcedural([Matrix4x4](Matrix4x4.html) matrix,
[Material](Material.html) material, int shaderPass,
[MeshTopology](MeshTopology.html) topology, int vertexCount, int instanceCount
= 1, [MaterialPropertyBlock](MaterialPropertyBlock.html) properties = null);

### Parameters

matrix | Transformation matrix to use.  
---|---  
material | Material to use.  
shaderPass | Which pass of the shader to use (or -1 for all passes).  
topology | Topology of the procedural geometry.  
vertexCount | Vertex count to render.  
instanceCount | Instance count to render.  
properties | Additional material properties to apply just before rendering. See [MaterialPropertyBlock](MaterialPropertyBlock.html).  
  
### Description

Add a "draw procedural geometry" command.

When the command buffer executes, this will do a draw call on the GPU, without
any vertex or index buffers. This is mainly useful on [Shader Model
4.5](../Manual/SL-ShaderCompileTargets.html) level hardware where shaders can
read arbitrary data from [ComputeBuffer](ComputeBuffer.html) buffers.  
  
In the vertex shader, you'd typically use the SV_VertexID and SV_InstanceID
input variables to fetch data from some buffers.  
  
Note that the draw call will not have any lighting related shader data (light
colors, directions, shadows, light and reflection probes etc.) set up. If the
shader used by the material uses any lighting related variables, the results
are undefined.
