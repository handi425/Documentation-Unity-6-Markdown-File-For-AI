### Description

A variant of Debug.Log that logs an assertion message to the console.

Message of a type of [LogType.Assert](LogType.Assert.html) is logged.  
  
Note that these methods work only if UNITY_ASSERTIONS symbol is defined. This
means that if you are building assemblies externally, you need to define this
symbol otherwise the call becomes a no-op. (For more details see
[System.Diagnostics.ConditionalAttribute](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-
us/library/system.diagnostics.conditionalattribute\(v=vs.110\).aspx) on the
MSDN website.
