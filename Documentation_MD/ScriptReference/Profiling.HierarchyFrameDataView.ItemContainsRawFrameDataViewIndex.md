## Declaration

public bool ItemContainsRawFrameDataViewIndex(int id, int sampleIndex);

### Parameters

id | Hierarchy item identifier.  
---|---  
sampleIndex | The particular profiler sample index that should be checked if it is represented by this hierarchy item.  
  
### Returns

**bool** True if the sample index is represented by this hierarchy item, false
if it is not.

### Description

Checks if the provided raw sample index matches any of the raw sample indices
associated with this Hierarchy item identifier.

When HierarchyFrameDataView.ViewMode.MergeSamplesWithTheSameName is active,
Unity merges multiple samples with the same name at the same hierarchy level
together in a single item.  
  
As a result of this behavior, and the hierarchical structure of the samples in
_HierarchyFrameDataView_ , the **Hierarchy item identifiers** that
_HierarchyFrameDataView_ uses, do not correspond to the **sample indices**
that [RawFrameDataView](Profiling.RawFrameDataView.html) uses. To get these
indices to use with [RawFrameDataView](Profiling.RawFrameDataView.html), use
_GetItemRawFrameDataViewIndices_.  
  
However, if you only want to confirm that an item in the
_HierarchyFrameDataView_ corresponds to a particular **sample index** you can
use _ItemContainsRawFrameDataViewIndex_ to confirm that without the need to
retrieve the entire list of **sample indices**.  
  
**Throws:**  
_System.ArgumentException_ if _id_ is invalid.
