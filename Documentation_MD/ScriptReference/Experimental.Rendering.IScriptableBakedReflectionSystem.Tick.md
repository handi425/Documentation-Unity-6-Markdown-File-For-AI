## Declaration

public void
Tick([Experimental.Rendering.SceneStateHash](Experimental.Rendering.SceneStateHash.html)
sceneStateHash,
[Experimental.Rendering.IScriptableBakedReflectionSystemStageNotifier](Experimental.Rendering.IScriptableBakedReflectionSystemStageNotifier.html)
handle);

### Parameters

sceneStateHash | Current Scene state hash.  
---|---  
handle | A handle to receive notifications about the status of the stages of the baking process.  
  
### Description

This method is called every Editor update until the
ScriptableBakedReflectionSystem indicates that the baking is complete, with
`handle.SetIsDone(true)`. (See
[IScriptableBakedReflectionSystemStageNotifier.SetIsDone](Experimental.Rendering.IScriptableBakedReflectionSystemStageNotifier.SetIsDone.html)).

You should use this to check if a bake is required by comparing the provided
hashes (or your own hashes) with the baked data.  
  
If you detect any changes, then this is the place to prepare and launch baking
jobs. While the jobs are running, you can indicate their progress with the
`handle.EnterStage(stage, progressMessage, progress)` call. See
[IScriptableBakedReflectionSystemStageNotifier.EnterStage](Experimental.Rendering.IScriptableBakedReflectionSystemStageNotifier.EnterStage.html).  
  
See
[IScriptableBakedReflectionSystem](Experimental.Rendering.IScriptableBakedReflectionSystem.html)
for examples.
