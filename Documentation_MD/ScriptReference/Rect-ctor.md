## Declaration

public Rect(float x, float y, float width, float height);

### Parameters

x | The X value the rect is measured from.  
---|---  
y | The Y value the rect is measured from.  
width | The width of the rectangle.  
height | The height of the rectangle.  
  
### Description

Creates a new rectangle.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class RectExample : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            [Rect](Rect.html) rect = new [Rect](Rect.html)(0, 0, 10, 10);  
      
            // prints: (x:0, y:0, width:10, height:10)
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)(rect);
        }
    }
    

Note: Rect represents an abstract rectangle, and can be used in a variety of
situations. As such, Rects don't have an explicit top, bottom, left or right.
For example, Y values in Camera space are measured from the bottom of the
screen, but Y values in Editor GUI space are measured from the top of the
window, therefore whether the Y value of a Rect is its "top" or "bottom" will
vary depending on where you use the Rect value. You can refer to the corners
by using [Rect.min](Rect-min.html) and [Rect.max](Rect-max.html).

## Declaration

public Rect([Vector2](Vector2.html) position, [Vector2](Vector2.html) size);

### Parameters

position | The position of the minimum corner of the rect.  
---|---  
size | The width and height of the rect.  
  
### Description

Creates a rectangle given a size and position.

This form of the constructor is convenient when you are already working with
Vector2 values.
