public float fileScale;

### Description

Scaling factor used when useFileScale is set to true (Read-only).

The scaling factor is based on the source of the model. For FBX files, the
scaling factor is the multiplier that converts the unit of measurement, of the
imported FBX file, to meters. For other file formats, the scaling factor is a
constant: \- .3ds, .mb, .ma, .c4d, .lxo, .jas : 0.1 \- .max : 1.0
