### Description

The ExternalGPUProfiler API allows developers to programatically take GPU
frame captures in conjunction with supported external GPU profilers.  
GPU frame captures can be used to both analyze performance and debug graphics
related issues.

GPU captures can be taken when running using the API both in Editor and in
standalone development builds.  
The ExternalGPUProfiler API supports both PIX and RenderDoc.  
  
  
**PIX Specific Support**  
Support for PIX is only available on Windows desktop when using the DirectX 12
rendering API.  
**NOTE:** The entire editor will be captured when capturing a frame in editor.  
  
**RenderDoc Specific Support**  
Support for RenderDoc is available when running on both Windows and Linux
desktop.  
Supported rendering APIs include DirectX 12, DirectX 11, and Vulkan.  
**NOTE:** Only the game view will be captured when capturing a frame in
editor.
