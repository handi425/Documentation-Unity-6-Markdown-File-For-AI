### Description

Stores a type to which a Preset can be applied.

Only classes that inherit from UnityEngine.Object are represented by a
PresetType.  
  
This structure is used instead of Type because some native C++ types in Unity
are not exposed to managed C# for optimization reasons.

### Public Methods

[GetManagedTypeName](Presets.PresetType.GetManagedTypeName.html)| Retrieves a
human readable namespace and the name of the target class, regardless of
whether it's a managed C# class or a native C++ class.  
---|---  
[IsValid](Presets.PresetType.IsValid.html)| Checks whether a PresetType
corresponds with a valid native or managed class.  
[IsValidDefault](Presets.PresetType.IsValidDefault.html)| Checks whether a
PresetType can be used within the DefaultPreset system.
