## Declaration

public void DrawWireOverlay([Camera](Camera.html) camera);

### Parameters

camera | The Scene view Camera to draw the overlay for.  
---|---  
  
### Description

Schedules the drawing of a wireframe overlay for a given Scene view Camera.

Note that `DrawWireOverlay` works only in the Unity Editor, when the
[Camera.cameraType](Camera-cameraType.html) is set to
[CameraType.SceneView](CameraType.SceneView.html), and the
[SceneView.CameraMode.drawMode](SceneView.CameraMode-drawMode.html) is set to
[DrawCameraMode.TexturedWire](DrawCameraMode.TexturedWire.html). If these
conditions are not met, calling `DrawWireOverlay` has no effect.  
  
To draw gizmos on top of the wireframe overlay in your Scene view, call
`DrawWireOverlay` and then call
[DrawGizmos](Rendering.ScriptableRenderContext.DrawGizmos.html).
