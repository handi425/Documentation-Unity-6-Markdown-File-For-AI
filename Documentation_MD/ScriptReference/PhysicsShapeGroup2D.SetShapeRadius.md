## Declaration

public void SetShapeRadius(int shapeIndex, float radius);

### Parameters

shapeIndex | The index of the shape stored in the [PhysicsShapeGroup2D](PhysicsShapeGroup2D.html). The shape index is zero-based with the shape group having a quantity of shapes specified by [shapeCount](PhysicsShapeGroup2D-shapeCount.html).  
---|---  
radius | The value to set the shape radius to.  
  
### Description

Sets the radius of a shape.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.Assertions;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            // Create a shape group.
            var shapeGroup = new [PhysicsShapeGroup2D](PhysicsShapeGroup2D.html)();  
      
            // Add a Circle to the shape group.
            var shapeIndex = shapeGroup.AddCircle
                (
                    center: [Vector2.zero](Vector2-zero.html),
                    radius: 0.5f
                );  
      
            // Fetch the Circle shape and validate the radius.
            var physicsShape = shapeGroup.GetShape(shapeIndex);
            [Assert.AreApproximatelyEqual](Assertions.Assert.AreApproximatelyEqual.html)(0.5f, physicsShape.radius);  
      
            // [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html) the Circle radius.
            shapeGroup.SetShapeRadius(shapeIndex, 2f);  
      
            // Fetch the Circle shape and validate the radius.
            physicsShape = shapeGroup.GetShape(shapeIndex);
            [Assert.AreApproximatelyEqual](Assertions.Assert.AreApproximatelyEqual.html)(2f, physicsShape.radius);
        }
    }
