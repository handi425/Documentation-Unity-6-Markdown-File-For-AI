public static bool editingTextField;

### Description

Is a text field currently editing text?

In Editor GUI, text fields can have focus without the text being edited. For
example you may switch focus between text fields or other controls by using
the up and down arrow keys. Once you click inside the text field, editing of
the text itself begins and the arrow keys are then used to navigate the text
content. [editingTextField](EditorGUIUtility-editingTextField.html) is true
when a text field is in this text editing mode.
