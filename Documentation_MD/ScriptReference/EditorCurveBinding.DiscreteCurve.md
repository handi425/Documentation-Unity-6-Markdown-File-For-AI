## Declaration

public static [EditorCurveBinding](EditorCurveBinding.html)
DiscreteCurve(string inPath, Type inType, string inPropertyName);

### Parameters

inPath | The transform path to the object to animate.  
---|---  
inType | The type of the object to animate.  
inPropertyName | The name of the property to animate on the object.  
  
### Description

Creates a preconfigured binding for a curve where values should not be
interpolated.

Use discrete curves for properties with discontinuous values, or for values
that should not be interpolated. For example, use
[EditorCurveBinding.DiscreteCurve](EditorCurveBinding.DiscreteCurve.html) for
enums or hashes. Discrete curves only support properties of type Int (with the
DiscreteEvaluation attribute) or Enum. If you attempt to bind discrete curves
to other types, a warning will be logged and a default interpolated float
curve binding will be returned (see
[EditorCurveBinding.FloatCurve](EditorCurveBinding.FloatCurve.html)).
