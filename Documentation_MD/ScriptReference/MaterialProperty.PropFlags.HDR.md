### Description

Signifies that values of this property contain High Dynamic Range (HDR) data.

When this flag is set, the default material Inspector will display warning if
incompatible data was assigned in the Material. For instance default material
Inspector will warn and suggest to fix the texture that contain alpha channel
(unsupported in HDR textures). This corresponds to "[HDR]" attribute in front
of property in the shader code.
