public static string graphicsDeviceVersion;

### Description

The graphics API type and driver version used by the graphics device (Read
Only).

Returns a string identifying low-level graphics API kind and driver version.
In most cases when you need to detect which graphics API is being used it is
much easier to use [SystemInfo.graphicsDeviceType](SystemInfo-
graphicsDeviceType.html).  
  
In case of OpenGL API, the returned string will contain "`OpenGL`" followed by
version in "`major.minor`" format, followed by full version string in square
brackets.  
  
In case of Direct3D9 API, the returned string will contain "`Direct3D 9.0c`"
followed by driver name and version in square brackets.  
  
In case of Direct3D11 API, the returned string will contain "`Direct3D 11.0`"
followed by feature level in square brackets.  
  
Additional resources: [SystemInfo.graphicsDeviceType](SystemInfo-
graphicsDeviceType.html), [SystemInfo.graphicsDeviceName](SystemInfo-
graphicsDeviceName.html), [SystemInfo.graphicsDeviceVendor](SystemInfo-
graphicsDeviceVendor.html).

    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)

            // Prints "Direct3D 9.0c [atiumdag.dll 7.14.10.471]" on MacBook Pro running Windows Vista
