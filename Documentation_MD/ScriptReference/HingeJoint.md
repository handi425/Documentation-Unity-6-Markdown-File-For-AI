in the Manual")

### Description

The HingeJoint groups together 2 rigid bodies, constraining them to move like
connected by a hinge.

This joint is great for, well, doors, but can also be used to model chains,
etc...  
  
The HingeJoint has a motor which can be used to make the hinge spin around the
joints axis. A spring which attempts to reach for a target angle by spinning
around the joints axis. And a limit which constrains the joint angle.

### Properties

[angle](HingeJoint-angle.html)| The current angle in degrees of the joint
relative to its rest position. (Read Only)  
---|---  
[extendedLimits](HingeJoint-extendedLimits.html)| If enabled, the angle of the
hinge is extended to [-360, 360] degrees.  
[limits](HingeJoint-limits.html)| Limit of angular rotation (in degrees) on
the hinge joint.  
[motor](HingeJoint-motor.html)| The motor will apply a force up to a maximum
force to achieve the target velocity in degrees per second.  
[spring](HingeJoint-spring.html)| The spring attempts to reach a target angle
by adding spring and damping forces.  
[useAcceleration](HingeJoint-useAcceleration.html)| Defines whether the
HingeJoint.spring outputs accelerations instead of forces.  
[useLimits](HingeJoint-useLimits.html)| Enables the joint's limits. Disabled
by default.  
[useMotor](HingeJoint-useMotor.html)| Enables the joint's motor. Disabled by
default.  
[useSpring](HingeJoint-useSpring.html)| Enables the joint's spring. Disabled
by default.  
[velocity](HingeJoint-velocity.html)| The angular velocity of the joint in
degrees per second. (Read Only)  
  
### Inherited Members

### Properties

[gameObject](Component-gameObject.html)| The game object this component is
attached to. A component is always attached to a game object.  
---|---  
[tag](Component-tag.html)| The tag of this game object.  
[transform](Component-transform.html)| The Transform attached to this
GameObject.  
[anchor](Joint-anchor.html)| The Position of the anchor around which the
joints motion is constrained.  
[autoConfigureConnectedAnchor](Joint-autoConfigureConnectedAnchor.html)|
Should the connectedAnchor be calculated automatically?  
[axis](Joint-axis.html)| The Direction of the axis around which the body is
constrained.  
[breakForce](Joint-breakForce.html)| The force that needs to be applied for
this joint to break.  
[breakTorque](Joint-breakTorque.html)| The torque that needs to be applied for
this joint to break. To be able to break, a joint must be _Locked_ or
_Limited_ on the axis of rotation where the torque is being applied. This
means that some joints cannot break, such as an unconstrained Configurable
Joint.  
[connectedAnchor](Joint-connectedAnchor.html)| Position of the anchor relative
to the connected Rigidbody.  
[connectedArticulationBody](Joint-connectedArticulationBody.html)| A reference
to an articulation body this joint connects to.  
[connectedBody](Joint-connectedBody.html)| A reference to another rigidbody
this joint connects to.  
[connectedMassScale](Joint-connectedMassScale.html)| The scale to apply to the
inverse mass and inertia tensor of the connected body prior to solving the
constraints.  
[currentForce](Joint-currentForce.html)| The force applied by the solver to
satisfy all constraints.  
[currentTorque](Joint-currentTorque.html)| The torque applied by the solver to
satisfy all constraints.  
[enableCollision](Joint-enableCollision.html)| Enable collision between bodies
connected with the joint.  
[enablePreprocessing](Joint-enablePreprocessing.html)| Toggle preprocessing
for this joint.  
[massScale](Joint-massScale.html)| The scale to apply to the inverse mass and
inertia tensor of the body prior to solving the constraints.  
[hideFlags](Object-hideFlags.html)| Should the object be hidden, saved with
the Scene or modifiable by the user?  
[name](Object-name.html)| The name of the object.  
  
### Public Methods

methodName on every MonoBehaviour in this game object or any of its children.  
---|---  
[CompareTag](Component.CompareTag.html)| Checks the GameObject's tag against
the defined tag.  
[GetComponent](Component.GetComponent.html)| Gets a reference to a component
of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified.

reference to a component of type T on the same GameObject as the component
specified, or any child of the GameObject.  
[GetComponentIndex](Component.GetComponentIndex.html)| Gets the index of the
component on its parent GameObject.  
[GetComponentInParent](Component.GetComponentInParent.html)| Gets a reference

any parent of the GameObject.  
[GetComponents](Component.GetComponents.html)| Gets references to all
components of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified.  
[GetComponentsInChildren](Component.GetComponentsInChildren.html)| Gets
references to all components of type T on the same GameObject as the component
specified, and any child of the GameObject.  
[GetComponentsInParent](Component.GetComponentsInParent.html)| Gets references
to all components of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified,
and any parent of the GameObject.

specified type, if it exists.  
[GetInstanceID](Object.GetInstanceID.html)| Gets the instance ID of the
object.

### Static Methods

[Destroy](Object.Destroy.html)| Removes a GameObject, component or asset.  
---|---  
[DestroyImmediate](Object.DestroyImmediate.html)| Destroys the object obj
immediately. You are strongly recommended to use Destroy instead.
