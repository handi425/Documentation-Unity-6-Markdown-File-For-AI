## Declaration

public static void
SetPlatformIcons([Build.NamedBuildTarget](Build.NamedBuildTarget.html)
buildTarget, [PlatformIconKind](PlatformIconKind.html) kind, PlatformIcon[]
icons);

**Obsolete** Use SetPlatformIcons(NamedBuildTarget , PlatformIconKind)
instead.

## Declaration

public static void SetPlatformIcons([BuildTargetGroup](BuildTargetGroup.html)
platform, [PlatformIconKind](PlatformIconKind.html) kind, PlatformIcon[]
icons);

### Parameters

platform | The full list of platforms that support this API the supported kinds can be found in [icon kinds](PlatformIconKind.html).  
---|---  
icons | All available [PlatformIcon](PlatformIcon.html) slots must be retrieved with GetPlatformIcons.  
buildTarget | The [NamedBuildTarget](Build.NamedBuildTarget.html).  
  
### Description

Assign a list of icons for the specified platform and icon kind.

Most platforms support icons with several different sizes. This methods allows
you to set [Icons](PlatformIcon.html) for each platform that supports them.
GetPlatformIcons has to be used to retrieve all the supported icons for
specified [PlatformIconKind](PlatformIconKind.html) and platform. Texture
files must be stored in the project and instances obtained using
[AssetDatabase.LoadAssetAtPath](AssetDatabase.LoadAssetAtPath.html).  
  
BuildTargetGroup is marked for deprecation in the future. Use
[NamedBuildTarget](Build.NamedBuildTarget.html) instead.  
  
The following code sample shows how to set up adaptive icons for an Android
application. This is an editor script which means it must be within an Editor
folder to compile.

    
    
    using UnityEditor.Android;
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEditor.Build;  
      
    public static class AndroidPlayerSettingsUtility
    {
        // `Adaptive` icons for [Android](PlayerSettings.Android.html) require a background and foreground layer for each icon
        public static void SetIcons([Texture2D](Texture2D.html)[][] textures)
        {
            [NamedBuildTarget](Build.NamedBuildTarget.html) platform = [NamedBuildTarget.Android](Build.NamedBuildTarget.Android.html);
            [PlatformIconKind](PlatformIconKind.html) kind = [AndroidPlatformIconKind.Adaptive](Android.AndroidPlatformIconKind.Adaptive.html);  
      
            [PlatformIcon](PlatformIcon.html)[] icons = [PlayerSettings.GetPlatformIcons](PlayerSettings.GetPlatformIcons.html)(platform, kind);  
      
            //Assign textures to each available icon slot.
            for (int i = 0; i < icons.Length; i++)
            {
                icons[i].SetTextures(textures[i]);
            }
            [PlayerSettings.SetPlatformIcons](PlayerSettings.SetPlatformIcons.html)(platform, kind, icons);
        }
    }
    

The following code sample shows how to set all App icons for an iOS
application. This is an editor script which means it must be within an Editor
folder to compile.

    
    
    using UnityEditor.iOS;
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEditor.Build;  
      
    public static class iOSPlayerSettingsUtility
    {
        // Setting all `App` icons for [iOS](PlayerSettings.iOS.html)
        public static void SetAppIcons([Texture2D](Texture2D.html)[] textures)
        {
            [NamedBuildTarget](Build.NamedBuildTarget.html) platform = [NamedBuildTarget.iOS](Build.NamedBuildTarget.iOS.html);
            [PlatformIconKind](PlatformIconKind.html) kind = [iOSPlatformIconKind.Application](iOS.iOSPlatformIconKind.Application.html);  
      
            [PlatformIcon](PlatformIcon.html)[] icons = [PlayerSettings.GetPlatformIcons](PlayerSettings.GetPlatformIcons.html)(platform, kind);  
      
            //Assign textures to each available icon slot.
            for (int i = 0; i < icons.Length; i++)
            {
                icons[i].SetTextures(textures[i]);
            }
            [PlayerSettings.SetPlatformIcons](PlayerSettings.SetPlatformIcons.html)(platform, kind, icons);
        }
    }
