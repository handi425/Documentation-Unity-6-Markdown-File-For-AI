## Declaration

public static void
SetTierSettings([Build.NamedBuildTarget](Build.NamedBuildTarget.html) target,
[Rendering.GraphicsTier](Rendering.GraphicsTier.html) tier,
[Rendering.TierSettings](Rendering.TierSettings.html) settings);

## Declaration

public static void SetTierSettings([BuildTargetGroup](BuildTargetGroup.html)
target, [Rendering.GraphicsTier](Rendering.GraphicsTier.html) tier,
[Rendering.TierSettings](Rendering.TierSettings.html) settings);

### Description

Set the [TierSettings](Rendering.TierSettings.html) for a given build target
and [graphics tier](../Manual/graphics-tiers.html).

**Note:** Graphics tiers and tier settings are only supported in the Built-in
Render Pipeline.  
  
If you change the [TierSettings](Rendering.TierSettings.html) for the active
build target, Unity reloads the shaders so you can see the results
immediately.  
  
Additional resources: [Graphics tiers](../Manual/graphics-tiers.html),
[GraphicsTier](Rendering.GraphicsTier.html),
[TierSettings](Rendering.TierSettings.html).
