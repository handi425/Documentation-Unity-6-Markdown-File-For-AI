## Declaration

public static void DrawLineStrip(ReadOnlySpan<Vector3> points, bool looped);

### Parameters

points | The points that define the sequence of lines to draw. The function draws a line between each point and the one that follows it.  
---|---  
looped | Whether to draw an additional line between the last point and the first. When this is `true`, Unity draws an additional line between `points[points.Length - 1]` and `points[0]`. When this is `false`, the lines terminate at the last point.  
  
### Description

Draws a line between each point in the supplied span.

This function provides a more efficient way to draw multiple lines than
repeatedly calling the [Gizmos.DrawLine](Gizmos.DrawLine.html) function for
each one.  
  
Unity draws the first line from `points[0]` to `points[1]`, the next from
`points[1]` to `points[2]`, and so on.
