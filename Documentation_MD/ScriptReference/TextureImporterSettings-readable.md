public bool readable;

### Description

Is texture data readable from scripts.

Texture has to be set as "readable" in order for
[Texture2D.GetPixel](Texture2D.GetPixel.html),
[Texture2D.GetPixels](Texture2D.GetPixels.html) and similar functions to work.
Textures are **not** set as readable by default.  
  
When texture is not readable, it consumes much less memory, because a system-
memory copy does not have to be kept around after texture is uploaded to the
graphics API.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
**Known Issue**. Please check with the Issue Tracker at
