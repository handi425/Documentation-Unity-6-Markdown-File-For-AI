public [Vector3](Vector3.html) extents;

### Description

The extents of the Bounding Box. This is always half of the [size](Bounds-
size.html) of the Bounds.

**Note:** If [Bounds.extents](Bounds-extents.html) has a negative value for
any axis, [Bounds.Contains](Bounds.Contains.html) always returns False.

    
    
    //Attach this script to a visible [GameObject](GameObject.html).
    //Click on the [GameObject](GameObject.html) to expand it and output the Bound extents to the Console.  
      
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        [Collider](Collider.html) m_ObjectCollider;
        public [Vector3](Vector3.html) m_MyScale;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            //Fetch the [GameObject](GameObject.html)'s collider (make sure they have a [Collider](Collider.html) component)
            m_ObjectCollider = gameObject.GetComponent<[Collider](Collider.html)>();
            //Output the [GameObject](GameObject.html)'s [Collider](Collider.html) Bound extents
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("extents : " + m_ObjectCollider.bounds.extents);
        }  
      
        //Detect when the user clicks the [GameObject](GameObject.html)
        void OnMouseDown()
        {
            //Change the scale of the [GameObject](GameObject.html) to the size you define in the Inspector
            transform.localScale = m_MyScale;
            //Output the extents of the [Bounds](Bounds.html) after clicking the [GameObject](GameObject.html). Extents change to half of the scale.
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("extents : " + m_ObjectCollider.bounds.extents);
        }
    }
