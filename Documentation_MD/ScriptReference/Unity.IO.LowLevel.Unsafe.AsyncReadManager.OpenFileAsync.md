## Declaration

public static
[Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.FileHandle](Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.FileHandle.html)
OpenFileAsync(string fileName);

### Parameters

fileName | The path to the file to be opened.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**FileHandle** The FileHandle of the file being opened. Use the FileHandle to
check the status of the open operation, to read the file, and to close the
file when done.

### Description

Opens the file asynchronously.

**Note:** WebGL builds do not support using `AsyncReadManager` to open files
from a remote web server; for example, from the path
`Application.streamingAssetsPath` which maps to a URL on a remote web server.

    
    
    using System.IO;
    using Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe;
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    class AsyncOpenSample : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        [FileHandle](Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.FileHandle.html) fileHandle;
        public unsafe void Start()
        {
            string filePath = Path.Combine([Application.streamingAssetsPath](Application-streamingAssetsPath.html), "myfile.bin");  
      
            fileHandle = [AsyncReadManager.OpenFileAsync](Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.AsyncReadManager.OpenFileAsync.html)(filePath);
        }  
      
        public unsafe void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            if (fileHandle.IsValid() && fileHandle.JobHandle.IsCompleted)
            {
                fileHandle.Close().Complete();
            }
        }
    }
