## Declaration

public static void
ConnectionTargetSelectionDropdown([Networking.PlayerConnection.IConnectionState](Networking.PlayerConnection.IConnectionState.html)
state, [GUIStyle](GUIStyle.html) style, int maxWidth);

### Parameters

state | The state of the connection that the [EditorWindow](EditorWindow.html) displaying the drop-down uses. Use [PlayerConnectionGUIUtility.GetConnectionState](Networking.PlayerConnection.PlayerConnectionGUIUtility.GetConnectionState.html) to get a state in OnEnable. Make sure you dispose of that state in OnDisable to avoid leaking it.  
---|---  
style | Define the [GUIStyle](GUIStyle.html) the drop-down button should be drawn in. A default drop-down button will be drawn if non is specified.  
maxWidth | The maximum width of the dropdown in pixels (optional).  
  
### Description

Display a drop-down button and menu for the user to choose and establish a
connection to a Player.

This is the same control that is used in the toolbars of the [Profiler
Window](../Manual/ProfilerWindow.html), [Frame
Debugger](../Manual/FrameDebugger.html) or [Console
Window](../Manual/Console.html). The drop-down will list all available Players
and Editors that your Editor can connect to and that are discoverable. It also
offers an entry to directly connect to an IP address. You need to provide the
state of the connection for your [EditorWindow](EditorWindow.html). To get the
state, use
[PlayerConnectionGUIUtility.GetConnectionState](Networking.PlayerConnection.PlayerConnectionGUIUtility.GetConnectionState.html)
in OnEnable. Make sure you dispose of the state in OnDisable of the
[EditorWindow](EditorWindow.html) you use it in to avoid leaking it.  
  
This class currently only works for the connection that the Profiling tools
and the Console use. In a future release this will work with
[PlayerConnection](Networking.PlayerConnection.PlayerConnection.html).

    public class MyWindow : [EditorWindow](EditorWindow.html)
    {
        // The state can survive for the life time of the [EditorWindow](EditorWindow.html) so it's best to store it here and just renew/dispose of it in OnEnable and OnDisable, rather than fetching repeatedly it in OnGUI.
        [IConnectionState](Networking.PlayerConnection.IConnectionState.html) attachProfilerState;

        {
            // The state of the connection is not getting serialized and needs to be disposed of.
            // Therefore, it's recommended to fetch it in OnEnable and call Dispose() on it in OnDisable.

                    //This case can never happen within the [Editor](Editor.html), since the [Editor](Editor.html) will always fall back onto a connection to itself.

                    // The name of the [Editor](Editor.html) or the [PlayMode](PlayMode.html) Player would be "[Editor](Editor.html)" so adding the connectionName here would not add anything.
                    [Profiler.enabled](Profiling.Profiler-enabled.html) = [GUILayout.Toggle](GUILayout.Toggle.html)([Profiler.enabled](Profiling.Profiler-enabled.html), "Profile the Player in the [Editor](Editor.html)", [EditorStyles.toolbarButton](EditorStyles-toolbarButton.html));
                    break;
                default:
                    break;
            }
            [EditorGUILayout.EndHorizontal](EditorGUILayout.EndHorizontal.html)();
        }  
      
        private void OnDisable()
        {
            // Remember to always dispose of the state!
            attachProfilerState.Dispose();
        }
