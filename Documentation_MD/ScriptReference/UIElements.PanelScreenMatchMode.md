### Description

Options that specify how to scale the panel area when the aspect ratio of the
current screen resolution does not match the reference resolution. See
[PanelSettings.screenMatchMode](UIElements.PanelSettings-
screenMatchMode.html).

### Properties

[MatchWidthOrHeight](UIElements.PanelScreenMatchMode.MatchWidthOrHeight.html)|
Scales the panel area using width, height, or a mix of the two as a reference.  
---|---  
[Shrink](UIElements.PanelScreenMatchMode.Shrink.html)|  Crops the panel area
horizontally or vertically so the panel size never exceeds the reference
resolution.  
[Expand](UIElements.PanelScreenMatchMode.Expand.html)|  Expand the panel area
horizontally or vertically so the panel size is never smaller than the
reference resolution.
