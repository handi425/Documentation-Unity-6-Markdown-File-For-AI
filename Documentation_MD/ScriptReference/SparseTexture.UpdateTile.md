## Declaration

public void UpdateTile(int tileX, int tileY, int miplevel, Color32[] data);

### Parameters

tileX | Tile X coordinate.  
---|---  
tileY | Tile Y coordinate.  
miplevel | Mipmap level of the texture.  
data | Tile color data.  
  
### Description

Update sparse texture tile with color values.

This function makes a tile at (tileX,tileY) coordinates resident in memory,
and updates its pixels. If a tile is already resident, then only the pixels
are updated.  
  
Data passed should have enough pixels for the tile (tileWidth*tileHeight
elements). Exception can be small mipmap levels that are smaller than tile
size; then it's ok to pass enough data for the mip level size.  
  
UpdateTile only works for non-compressed color formats. If you use a sparse
texture with a compressed format, use
[UpdateTileRaw](SparseTexture.UpdateTileRaw.html) and pass raw tile data bytes
(e.g. DXT/BCn-compressed data). UpdateTileRaw can also be more efficient if
texture format is not RGBA32, as then Unity does not have to convert from
Color32 data into the underlying texture format.

[UpdateTileRaw](SparseTexture.UpdateTileRaw.html).
