## Declaration

public void MarkModified();

### Description

Notify [Renderer](Renderer.html) components of mesh geometry change.

By default, whenever Mesh data changes that could affect the geometry of the
mesh, all [Renderer](Renderer.html) components that use this mesh get
notified. For example, [MeshRenderer](MeshRenderer.html) components
recalculate their bounding boxes, and
[ShapeModule](ParticleSystem.ShapeModule.html) rebuild internal data used for
mesh surface emission.  
  
However a
[MeshUpdateFlags.DontNotifyMeshUsers](Rendering.MeshUpdateFlags.DontNotifyMeshUsers.html)
flag can be used in [Mesh.SetVertexBufferData](Mesh.SetVertexBufferData.html),
[Mesh.SetIndexBufferData](Mesh.SetIndexBufferData.html) or
[Mesh.SetSubMesh](Mesh.SetSubMesh.html) in order to skip this notification.
This can be beneficial when you know that many mesh modifications will happen
before the renderer components will need to actually update. A manual call to
`MarkModified` can be used later to notify the dependent renderer components
of a mesh geometry change.  
  
`MarkModified` function only needs to be called if you actually use the
`DontNotifyMeshUsers` flag. In all other cases the mesh change notifications
happen automatically.
