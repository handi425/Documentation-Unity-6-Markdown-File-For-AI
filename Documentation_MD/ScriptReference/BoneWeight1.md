### Description

Describes a bone weight that affects a vertex in a mesh.

This struct can be used with the
[Mesh.GetAllBoneWeights](Mesh.GetAllBoneWeights.html),
[Mesh.SetBoneWeights](Mesh.SetBoneWeights.html) and
[Mesh.GetBonesPerVertex](Mesh.GetBonesPerVertex.html) APIs to describe up to
255 bone weights per vertex.  
  
Note that the older [BoneWeight](BoneWeight.html) struct, and the associated
[Mesh.boneWeights](Mesh-boneWeights.html) and
[Mesh.GetBoneWeights](Mesh.GetBoneWeights.html) APIs, describe exactly 4 bone
weights per vertex. It is preferable to use [BoneWeight1](BoneWeight1.html)
and its associated APIs; they offer more flexibility, and might result in
small performance benefits as Unity does not have to perform unnecessary
conversion operations.
