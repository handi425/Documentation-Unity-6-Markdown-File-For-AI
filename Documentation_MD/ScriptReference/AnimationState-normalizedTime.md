public float normalizedTime;

### Description

Normalized time of the State.

The normalized time is a progression ratio. The integer part is the number of
times the State has looped. The fractional part is a percentage (0-1) that
represents the progress of the current loop. For example, a normalized time of
0.5 means that the State has not looped (0) and is halfway (50% or .5) through
the first loop.

    using System.Collections;

    {
        public [Animation](Animation.html) anim;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            // Fast forward to the middle of the animation
            anim["Walk"].normalizedTime = 0.5f;
        }
    }
