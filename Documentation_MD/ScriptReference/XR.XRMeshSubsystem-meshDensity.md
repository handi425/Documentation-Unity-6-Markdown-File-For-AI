public float meshDensity;

### Description

Call this function to request a change in the density of the generated Meshes.
Unity gives the density level as a value within the range 0.0 to 1.0 and the
provider determines how to map that value to their implementation. Setting
this value does not guarantee an immediate change in the density of any
currently created Mesh and may only change the density for new or updated
Meshes.
