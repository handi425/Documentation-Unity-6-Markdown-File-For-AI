## Declaration

public static void EndThreadProfiling();

### Description

Frees the internal resources used by the Profiler for the thread.

Profiler allocates memory to store information about the thread. To free that
memory use _EndThreadProfiling_. Once called, Profiler stops collecting any
data on the thread.  
  
**Note:** Calling this method on an internal Unity thread (such as main
thread, render thread or job system threads) has no effect.

            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
            {
                sampler.Begin();
