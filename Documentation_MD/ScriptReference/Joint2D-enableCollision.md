public bool enableCollision;

### Description

Should the two [Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) connected with this joint
collide with each other?

When this is disabled, the two [Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) connected with
this joint will never produce collision or trigger contacts with each other.
When this is enabled, the [Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) are allowed to
produce collision or trigger contacts should they be configured to do so.  
  
NOTE: When this is disabled but no
[Joint2D.connectedBody](Joint2D-connectedBody.html) is specified then no
collision or trigger contacts are produced with any implicitly Static
[Collider2D](Collider2D.html) i.e. [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) that are not
attached to any [Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html).  
  
Additional resources: [Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) class,
[connectedBody](Joint2D-connectedBody.html).
