## Declaration

public void OverridePhysicsShape(IList<Vector2[]> physicsShapes);

### Parameters

physicsShapes | A multidimensional list of points in [Sprite.rect](Sprite-rect.html) space denoting the physics shape outlines.  
---|---  
  
### Description

Sets up a new Sprite physics shape.

The positions are in [Sprite.rect](Sprite-rect.html) space and this space is
from [Rect.zero](Rect-zero.html) to [Rect.size](Rect-size.html). Pivot offset
and transformation to unit space are done automatically. Values outside of the
Rect bounds are valid and are transformed based on [Sprite.rect](Sprite-
rect.html) space.  
  
Each internal array of physics shape outlines must have more than 2 positions
to be able to describe a shape.  
  
Additional resources: [Sprite.rect](Sprite-rect.html).
