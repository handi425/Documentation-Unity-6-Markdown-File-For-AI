public float maxDistance;

### Description

Distance a vertex is allowed to travel from the skinned mesh vertex position.

The Cloth component makes sure that the cloth vertices stay within maxDistance
from the skinned mesh vertex positions. If maxDistance is zero, the vertex is
not simulated but set to the skinned mesh vertex position. This behavior is
useful for attaching the cloth vertex to the skin of an animated character.
Default: 0.2 Range: [0, inf).
