Component in the Manual")

## Declaration

public bool IsSupported(int kernelIndex);

### Parameters

kernelIndex | Which kernel to query.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**bool** True if the specified compute kernel is able to run on the current
end user device, false otherwise.

### Description

Allows you to check whether the current end user device supports the features
required to run the specified compute shader kernel.

The result of this call depends on which hardware requirements the compute
shader in question is expected to rely on (as defined by the `#pragma require
<requirement_a> <requirement_b> <requirement_c> ...` shader syntax). This
method implicitly refers to the compute shader variant defined by the set of
currently enabled shader keywords (the variant that would be run if
[ComputeShader.Dispatch](ComputeShader.Dispatch.html) were called instead).
This means that when the source code of the shader in question contains per-
keyword requirements defined using the '#pragma require KEYWORD_A KEYWORD_B
... : <requirement_a> <requirement_b> <requirement_c>...' syntax the result of
[IsSupported](ComputeShader.IsSupported.html) might depend on which shader
keywords are enabled.
