public static string iconUssClassName;

### Description

The USS class name for Button elements with an icon.

Unity adds this USS class to an instance of the Button element if the
instance's [Button.iconImage](UIElements.Button-iconImage.html) property
contains a valid Texture. Any styling applied to this class affects every
button with an icon located beside, or below the stylesheet in the visual
tree.
