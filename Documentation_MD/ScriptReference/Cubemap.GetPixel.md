## Declaration

public [Color](Color.html) GetPixel([CubemapFace](CubemapFace.html) face, int
x, int y, int mip = 0);

### Parameters

x | The x coordinate of the pixel to get. The range is `0` through (texture width - 1).  
---|---  
y | The y coordinate of the pixel to get. The range is `0` through (texture height - 1).  
mip | The mipmap level to sample. The range is `0` through the texture's [Texture.mipmapCount](Texture-mipmapCount.html). The default value is `0`.  
face | The [CubemapFace](CubemapFace.html) to sample.  
  
### Returns

**Color** The pixel color.

### Description

Gets the pixel color at coordinates (`x`, `y`).

This method gets pixel data from the texture in CPU memory.
[Texture.isReadable](Texture-isReadable.html) must be `true`.  
  
The lower left corner of a face is (0, 0). If the pixel coordinate is outside
the texture's dimensions, Unity clamps or repeats it, depending on the
texture's [TextureWrapMode](TextureWrapMode.html).  
  
`GetPixel` might be slower than some other texture methods because it converts
the format the texture uses into [Color](Color.html). `GetPixel` also needs to
decompress compressed textures, and use memory to store the decompressed area.
To get pixel data more quickly, use [GetPixelData](Cubemap.GetPixelData.html)
instead.  
  
If you need to get a large block of pixels, it might be faster to use
[GetPixels](Cubemap.GetPixels.html).  
  
You can't use `GetPixel` with textures that use Crunch texture compression.  
  
Additional resources: [GetPixels](Cubemap.GetPixels.html),
[SetPixel](Cubemap.SetPixel.html).

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public [Cubemap](Cubemap.html) texture;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            // prints the color of the pixel at (0,0) of the +X face
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)(texture.GetPixel([CubemapFace.PositiveX](CubemapFace.PositiveX.html), 0, 0));
        }
    }
