### Description

Provides read-only access to
[ReadOnly](Unity.Collections.NativeArray_1.ReadOnly.html) elements by index.

The elements of the array are returned by value, not by reference. If you need
the reference, use the NativeArray.ReadOnly.UnsafeElementAt(int) method.  
  
Additional resources: ReadOnly.UnsafeElementAt.
