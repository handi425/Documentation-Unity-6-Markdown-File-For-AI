public [RenderTexture](RenderTexture.html) targetTexture;

### Description

[RenderTexture](RenderTexture.html) to draw to when
[VideoPlayer.renderMode](Video.VideoPlayer-renderMode.html) is set to
Video.VideoTarget.RenderTexture.

If the [RenderTexture](RenderTexture.html) is of
[TextureDimension.Tex2D](Rendering.TextureDimension.Tex2D.html) the video
frames will be drawn directly into this target. For optimal performance,
[RenderTexture.width](RenderTexture-width.html) and
[RenderTexture.height](RenderTexture-height.html) should match those of the
video media exactly.  
  
If the [RenderTexture](RenderTexture.html) is of
[TextureDimension.Cube](Rendering.TextureDimension.Cube.html) the video frames
will be interpreted as a cubemap in one of the 4 supported layouts (horizontal
or vertical orientation of a cross or strip layout) based on video aspect
ratio. The cubemap faces of the video frame are drawn to the 6 faces of the
[RenderTexture](RenderTexture.html). For a one-to-one pixel mapping,
[RenderTexture.width](RenderTexture-width.html) and
[RenderTexture.height](RenderTexture-height.html) should match the size of the
individual faces contained within the video media's cubemap (eg. for a
2048x1536 horizontal cross cubemap video, the
[RenderTexture](RenderTexture.html) cube size should be set to 512x512).
