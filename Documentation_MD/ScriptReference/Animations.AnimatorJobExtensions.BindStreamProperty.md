## Declaration

public static
[Animations.PropertyStreamHandle](Animations.PropertyStreamHandle.html)
BindStreamProperty([Animator](Animator.html) animator,
[Transform](Transform.html) transform, Type type, string property);

## Declaration

public static
[Animations.PropertyStreamHandle](Animations.PropertyStreamHandle.html)
BindStreamProperty([Animator](Animator.html) animator,
[Transform](Transform.html) transform, Type type, string property, bool
isObjectReference = false);

### Parameters

animator | The [Animator](Animator.html) instance that calls this method.  
---|---  
transform | The [Transform](Transform.html) to target.  
type | The [Component](Component.html) type.  
property | The property to bind.  
isObjectReference | isObjectReference need to be set to true if the property to bind does animate an Object like [SpriteRenderer.sprite](SpriteRenderer-sprite.html).  
  
### Returns

**PropertyStreamHandle** Returns the PropertyStreamHandle that represents the
new binding.

### Description

Create a PropertyStreamHandle representing the new binding on the
[Component](Component.html) property of a [Transform](Transform.html) already
bound to the [Animator](Animator.html).

You can bind a property that doesn't exist yet. For example you can bind a
property on a [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html) that will be added later
dynamically. In this case, you need to manually resolve the handle after
adding the [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html) on the
[GameObject](GameObject.html), using
[ResolveAllStreamHandles](Animations.AnimatorJobExtensions.ResolveAllStreamHandles.html).
