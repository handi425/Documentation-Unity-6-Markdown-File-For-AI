public long elapsedNanoseconds;

### Description

Accumulated time of Begin/End pairs for the previous frame in nanoseconds.
(Read Only)

Long-lasting operations (for example, on a preloading thread) might not end
within a single frame. In this case, **elapsedNanoseconds** is calculated
until the end of the frame, so you can always see activity for these
operations.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.Profiling;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        [Recorder](Profiling.Recorder.html) behaviourUpdateRecorder;
        void Start()
        {
            behaviourUpdateRecorder = [Recorder.Get](Profiling.Recorder.Get.html)("BehaviourUpdate");
            behaviourUpdateRecorder.enabled = true;
        }  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            if (behaviourUpdateRecorder.isValid)
                [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("BehaviourUpdate time: " + behaviourUpdateRecorder.elapsedNanoseconds);
        }
    }
    

Use _elapsedNanoseconds_ to retrieve timings of a code tagged with
[ProfilerMarker.Auto](Unity.Profiling.ProfilerMarker.Auto.html).

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.Profiling;  
      
    public class Example
    {
        public static void TimeSynchronousMethodWithMarkers()
        {
            var recorder = [Recorder.Get](Profiling.Recorder.Get.html)("MyMarker");
            recorder.enabled = true; // Start measurements  
      
            // Call method which uses MyMarker
            // MyMethod();  
      
            recorder.enabled = false; // Stops measurements and makes data available immediately
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("MyMarker total time, ns: " + recorder.elapsedNanoseconds);
        }
    }
    

In synchronous measurements that don't involve a frame change,
_elapsedNanoseconds_ only becomes a non-zero value after the Recorder is
disabled.
