### Description

This is an optimized version of the
[XRSettings.StereoRenderingMode.SinglePass](XR.XRSettings.StereoRenderingMode.SinglePass.html)
mode.

The scene graph is only traversed once and a single instanced draw call is
issued for each render node, thus reducing the bandwidth required to render
the scene. Scene culling and shadow map rendering is shared between both eyes.
The main render target must be an array of render targets. Special hardware
support is required for this mode to run. See the
[manual](../Manual/SinglePassStereoRendering.html) for how to get the most out
of instanced rendering. Additional resources:
[XRSettings.stereoRenderingMode](XR.XRSettings-stereoRenderingMode.html).
