## Declaration

public static [Search.SearchProvider](Search.SearchProvider.html)
CreateGroupProvider([Search.SearchProvider](Search.SearchProvider.html)
templateProvider, string groupId, int groupPriority, bool cacheProvider);

### Parameters

templateProvider | Search provider template to copy.  
---|---  
groupId | New group id. This id is also used as the display name for the group tab if displayed in the [ISearchView](Search.ISearchView.html).  
groupPriority | Priority used to order the group tab in the [ISearchView](Search.ISearchView.html).  
cacheProvider | Ask the system to cache the provider in case the function gets called with the same ID later.  
  
### Returns

**SearchProvider** A new search provider that can be used temporarily for a
given search session.

### Description

Copy of a search provider to create a new group copy.

This can be useful to base a new search provider on an existing one simply by
replacing a few handlers. Note that this search provider will not be globally
available, in example with
[SearchService.GetProvider](Search.SearchService.GetProvider.html).

    
    
    static [SearchProvider](Search.SearchProvider.html) CreateDecalProvider()
    {
        var assetProvider = [SearchService.GetProvider](Search.SearchService.GetProvider.html)("asset");
        var decalProvider = [SearchUtils.CreateGroupProvider](Search.SearchUtils.CreateGroupProvider.html)(assetProvider, "Decals", 0, true);
        decalProvider.fetchPropositions = EnumerateDecalPropositions;
        return decalProvider;
    }
