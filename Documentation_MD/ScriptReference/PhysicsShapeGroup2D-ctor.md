## Declaration

public PhysicsShapeGroup2D(int shapeCapacity = 1, int vertexCapacity = 8);

### Parameters

shapeCapacity | The initial capacity of the [PhysicsShape2D](PhysicsShape2D.html) list used to contain the shapes.  
---|---  
vertexCapacity | The initial capacity of the [vertices](Vector2.html) list used to contain the shape geometry.  
  
### Description

Initializes and returns an instance of
[PhysicsShapeGroup2D](PhysicsShapeGroup2D.html). The shape group will be empty
and ready for use by [Collider2D.GetShapes](Collider2D.GetShapes.html),
[Rigidbody2D.GetShapes](Rigidbody2D.GetShapes.html) or manually adding shapes.

Both the `shapeCapacity` and `vertexCapacity` should be set high enough so
that new allocations are not required and therefore no garbage collection work
is produced.
