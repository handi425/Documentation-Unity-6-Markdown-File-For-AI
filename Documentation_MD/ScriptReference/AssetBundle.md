### Description

API for accessing the content of AssetBundle files.

This class exposes an API, via static methods, for loading and managing
AssetBundles.  
  
This same class offers non-static methods and properties that expose the
contents of a specific loaded AssetBundle, including the ability to load an
Asset from within an AssetBundle.  
  
Create AssetBundles by calling
[BuildPipeline.BuildAssetBundles](BuildPipeline.BuildAssetBundles.html) or
using the [Addressables
package](http://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.addressables@latest/index.html).
The build process generates one or more AssetBundle files, and each
AssetBundle file contains a serialized instance of this class.  
  
Note: AssetBundle.LoadAsset, and the other Load methods, do not support
loading Scenes from AssetBundles. Instead, in runtime you load the streamed
scene AssetBundle and then call
[SceneManager.LoadScene](SceneManagement.SceneManager.LoadScene.html) or
[SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync](SceneManagement.SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync.html)
with the Scene name. In the Editor it is not supported to load Scenes from
AssetBundles so calls to
[EditorSceneManager.OpenScene](SceneManagement.EditorSceneManager.OpenScene.html)
will fail with an error that the Scene file is not found.

AssetBundles](../Manual/AssetBundlesIntro.html),

[BuildPipeline.BuildAssetBundles](BuildPipeline.BuildAssetBundles.html).

    
    
    using System.Collections;
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.Networking;  
      
    public class SampleBehaviour : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        IEnumerator Start()
        {
            var uwr = [UnityWebRequestAssetBundle.GetAssetBundle](Networking.UnityWebRequestAssetBundle.GetAssetBundle.html)("https://myserver/myBundle.unity3d");
            yield return uwr.SendWebRequest();  
      
            // Get an asset from the bundle and instantiate it.
            [AssetBundle](AssetBundle.html) bundle = [DownloadHandlerAssetBundle.GetContent](Networking.DownloadHandlerAssetBundle.GetContent.html)(uwr);
            var loadAsset = bundle.LoadAssetAsync<[GameObject](GameObject.html)>("Assets/Players/MainPlayer.prefab");
            yield return loadAsset;  
      
            Instantiate(loadAsset.asset);  
      
            bundle.Unload(true);
        }
    }
