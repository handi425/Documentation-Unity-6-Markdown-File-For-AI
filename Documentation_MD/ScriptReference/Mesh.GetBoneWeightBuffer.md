## Declaration

public [GraphicsBuffer](GraphicsBuffer.html)
GetBoneWeightBuffer([SkinWeights](SkinWeights.html) layout);

### Parameters

layout | Which buffer to access, based on maximum bones per vertex.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**GraphicsBuffer** The bone weight data as a
[GraphicsBuffer](GraphicsBuffer.html).

### Description

Retrieves a [GraphicsBuffer](GraphicsBuffer.html) that provides direct read
and write access to GPU bone weight data.

The buffer that this function returns is called the bone weight buffer. It
contains indices and weights to use for skinning.  
  
To know which buffer the mesh is using, call [skinWeightBufferLayout](Mesh-
skinWeightBufferLayout.html).  
  
It is possible to access the buffer with a lower SkinWeigts setting, for
instance a mesh with [SkinWeights.Unlimited](SkinWeights.Unlimited.html) can
be accessed with [SkinWeights.FourBones](SkinWeights.FourBones.html) and
[SkinWeights.TwoBones](SkinWeights.TwoBones.html). However, a mesh with
[SkinWeights.FourBones](SkinWeights.FourBones.html) can not be accessed using
[SkinWeights.Unlimited](SkinWeights.Unlimited.html).  
  
[Mesh.isReadable](Mesh-isReadable.html) does not need to be `true` to access
this data.  
  
After using this buffer, you should dispose of it.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public [Mesh](Mesh.html) mesh;
        public [ComputeShader](ComputeShader.html) computeShader;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            // Fetch [GraphicsBuffer](GraphicsBuffer.html) with [Bone](XR.Bone.html) Weight data
            var boneWeightBuffer = mesh.GetBoneWeightBuffer(mesh.skinWeightBufferLayout);  
      
            // Set [Bone](XR.Bone.html) Weight data to a compute shader
            computeShader.SetBuffer(0, "BoneWeightBuffer", boneWeightBuffer);  
      
            // Dispatch compute shader and access [Bone](XR.Bone.html) Weight data on the GPU
            computeShader.Dispatch(0, 64, 1, 1);  
      
            // Dispose of [GraphicsBuffer](GraphicsBuffer.html) to avoid leaking memory
            boneWeightBuffer .Dispose();
        }  
      
    }
