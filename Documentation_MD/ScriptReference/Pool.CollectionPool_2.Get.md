    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.Pool;  
      
    // This example shows how both version of Get could be used to simplify a line of points.
    public class Simplify2DLine
    {
        public List<[Vector2](Vector2.html)> SimplifyLine([Vector2](Vector2.html)[] points)
        {
            // This version will only be returned to the pool if we call Release on it.
            var simplifiedPoints = CollectionPool<List<[Vector2](Vector2.html)>, [Vector2](Vector2.html)>.Get();  
      
            // Copy the points into a temp list so we can pass them into the Simplify method
            // When the pooled object leaves the scope it will be Disposed and returned to the pool automatically.
            // This version is ideal for working with temporary lists.
            using (CollectionPool<List<[Vector2](Vector2.html)>, [Vector2](Vector2.html)>.Get(out List<[Vector2](Vector2.html)> tempList))
            {
                for (int i = 0; i < points.Length; ++i)
                {
                    tempList.Add(points[i]);
                }  
      
                [LineUtility.Simplify](LineUtility.Simplify.html)(tempList, 1.5f, simplifiedPoints);
            }
            return simplifiedPoints;
        }
    }
