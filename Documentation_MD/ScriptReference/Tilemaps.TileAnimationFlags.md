### Description

Options for flags controlling behavior for a Tile Animation on a
[Tilemap](Tilemaps.Tilemap.html).

### Properties

[None](Tilemaps.TileAnimationFlags.None.html)| Sets no TileAnimationFlags and
the Tile Animation will run normally.  
---|---  
[LoopOnce](Tilemaps.TileAnimationFlags.LoopOnce.html)| Loops the Tile
Animation once, then stops on the last Sprite of the animation.  
[PauseAnimation](Tilemaps.TileAnimationFlags.PauseAnimation.html)| Pauses the
Tile Animation, stopping it from running.  
[UpdatePhysics](Tilemaps.TileAnimationFlags.UpdatePhysics.html)| Updates the
Physics Shape in the TilemapCollider2D whenever the Tile Animation switches to
the next Sprite in the animation.  
[UnscaledTime](Tilemaps.TileAnimationFlags.UnscaledTime.html)| When true, the
unscaled time is used to run the Tile Animation. Otherwise, the scaled time is
used to run the Tile Animation.  
[SyncAnimation](Tilemaps.TileAnimationFlags.SyncAnimation.html)| When set,
this will sync the start time of this Tile Animation with other Tile
Animations that are the same.
