### Parameters

graph | The [PlayableGraph](Playables.PlayableGraph.html) to sample.  
---|---  
index | The output index to sample in the Playable Graph.  
time | The time at which to sample.  
  
### Description

Samples the specified output index of a
[PlayableGraph](Playables.PlayableGraph.html) and also records modified
properties when in Animation mode.

To successfully use this method,
[BeginSampling](AnimationMode.BeginSampling.html) must be called before this
method and [EndSampling](AnimationMode.EndSampling.html) must be called after.
If a property is no longer sampled (for example, through
[SampleAnimationClip](AnimationMode.SampleAnimationClip.html),
[SamplePlayableGraph](AnimationMode.SamplePlayableGraph.html), or
[AddPropertyModification](AnimationMode.AddPropertyModification.html)), the
property reverts to its original value when
[EndSampling](AnimationMode.EndSampling.html) is called.
