### Description

Delegate that you can use to invoke custom code right before
[RenderPipelineManager.currentPipeline](Rendering.RenderPipelineManager-
currentPipeline.html) is disposed.

Whenever you switch
[GraphicsSettings.currentRenderPipeline](Rendering.GraphicsSettings-
currentRenderPipeline.html) or
[QualitySettings.renderPipeline](QualitySettings-renderPipeline.html), Unity
will dispose the current `RenderPipeline` before instantiate the new
`RenderPipeline`. You can subscribe to this event to know when current
`RenderPipeline` will be disposed. To access the currently disposing
`RenderPipeline` object you can rely on
[RenderPipelineManager.currentPipeline](Rendering.RenderPipelineManager-
currentPipeline.html).

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.Rendering;  
      
    public class CurrentRenderPipelineDisposedExample : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            [RenderPipelineManager.activeRenderPipelineDisposed](Rendering.RenderPipelineManager-activeRenderPipelineDisposed.html) += RenderPipelineManager_activeRenderPipelineDisposed;
        }  
      
        private void OnDestroy()
        {
            [RenderPipelineManager.activeRenderPipelineDisposed](Rendering.RenderPipelineManager-activeRenderPipelineDisposed.html) -= RenderPipelineManager_activeRenderPipelineDisposed;
        }  
      
        private void RenderPipelineManager_activeRenderPipelineDisposed()
        {
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)($"Render Pipeline {RenderPipelineManager.currentPipeline.GetType().Name} is disposing.");
        }
    }
