[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-Rigidbody.html "Go to Rigidbody Component
in the Manual")

## Declaration

public RaycastHit[] SweepTestAll([Vector3](Vector3.html) direction, float
maxDistance = Mathf.Infinity,
[QueryTriggerInteraction](QueryTriggerInteraction.html)
queryTriggerInteraction = QueryTriggerInteraction.UseGlobal);

### Parameters

direction | The direction into which to sweep the rigidbody.  
---|---  
maxDistance | The length of the sweep.  
queryTriggerInteraction | Specifies whether this query should hit Triggers.  
  
### Returns

**RaycastHit[]** An array of all colliders hit in the sweep.

### Description

Like [Rigidbody.SweepTest](Rigidbody.SweepTest.html), but returns all hits.

The sweep may return multiple hits against the same collider if more then one
of the rigidbody's attached colliders would hit it.  
  
Note that this function only works when a primitive collider type (sphere,
cube or capsule) or a convex mesh is attached to the rigidbody object -
concave mesh colliders will not work, although they can be detected in the
Scene by the sweep.  
  
This function can only return up to 128 hits.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
**Known Issue**. Please check with the Issue Tracker at
