[ ]()

public float yMax;

### Description

Returns or specifies the maximum angular motion about the y-axis.

The value returned by this property depends on the current value of the
[yMotion](IMGUI.Controls.JointAngularLimitHandle-yMotion.html) property. If it
is [ConfigurableJointMotion.Locked](ConfigurableJointMotion.Locked.html), then
it will always return 0. If it is
[ConfigurableJointMotion.Free](ConfigurableJointMotion.Free.html), then it
will always return the upper limit of
[yRange](IMGUI.Controls.JointAngularLimitHandle-yRange.html). If it is
[ConfigurableJointMotion.Limited](ConfigurableJointMotion.Limited.html), then
it will be clamped between the upper limit of
[yRange](IMGUI.Controls.JointAngularLimitHandle-yRange.html) and the current
value of [yMin](IMGUI.Controls.JointAngularLimitHandle-yMin.html).  
  
Additional resources: [yMin](IMGUI.Controls.JointAngularLimitHandle-
yMin.html), [yMotion](IMGUI.Controls.JointAngularLimitHandle-yMotion.html),
[yRange](IMGUI.Controls.JointAngularLimitHandle-yRange.html).
