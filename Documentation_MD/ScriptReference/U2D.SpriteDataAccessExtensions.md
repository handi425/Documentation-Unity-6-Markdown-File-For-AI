### Description

A list of methods designed for reading and writing to the rich internal data
of a Sprite.

It is now possible to read and write to all the channels of the
VertexAttribute, BoneWeight, BindPose and the SpriteBones of a Sprite.

### Static Methods

[GetBindPoses](U2D.SpriteDataAccessExtensions.GetBindPoses.html)| Returns an
array of BindPoses.  
---|---  
[GetBones](U2D.SpriteDataAccessExtensions.GetBones.html)| Returns a list of
SpriteBone in this Sprite.  
[GetIndices](U2D.SpriteDataAccessExtensions.GetIndices.html)| Returns a list
of indices. This is the same as Sprite.triangle.  
[GetVertexAttribute](U2D.SpriteDataAccessExtensions.GetVertexAttribute.html)|
Retrieves a strided accessor to the internal vertex attributes.  
[GetVertexCount](U2D.SpriteDataAccessExtensions.GetVertexCount.html)| Returns
the number of vertices in this Sprite.  
[HasVertexAttribute](U2D.SpriteDataAccessExtensions.HasVertexAttribute.html)|
Checks if a specific channel exists for this Sprite.  
[SetBindPoses](U2D.SpriteDataAccessExtensions.SetBindPoses.html)| Sets the
bind poses for this Sprite.  
[SetBones](U2D.SpriteDataAccessExtensions.SetBones.html)| Sets the SpriteBones
for this Sprite.  
[SetIndices](U2D.SpriteDataAccessExtensions.SetIndices.html)| Set the indices
for this Sprite. This is the same as Sprite.triangle.  
[SetVertexAttribute](U2D.SpriteDataAccessExtensions.SetVertexAttribute.html)|
Sets a specific channel of the VertexAttribute.  
[SetVertexCount](U2D.SpriteDataAccessExtensions.SetVertexCount.html)| Sets the
vertex count. This resizes the internal buffer. It also preserves any
configurations of VertexAttributes.
