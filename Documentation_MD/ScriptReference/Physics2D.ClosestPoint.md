## Declaration

public static [Vector2](Vector2.html) ClosestPoint([Vector2](Vector2.html)
position, [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) collider);

### Parameters

position | The position from which to find the closest point on the specified `Collider`.  
---|---  
Collider | The Collider on which to find the closest specified `position`.  
  
### Returns

**Vector2** A point on the perimeter of the `Collider` that is closest to the
specified `position`.

### Description

Returns a point on the perimeter of the `Collider` that is closest to the
specified `position`.

This function provides the ability to calculate the closest point of a
specified `position` to the perimeter of any [Collider2D](Collider2D.html)
type.  
  
In the case where the `position` is inside the `Collider` or the `Collider` is
disabled, then the input `position` is returned instead.

## Declaration

public static [Vector2](Vector2.html) ClosestPoint([Vector2](Vector2.html)
position, [Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html) rigidbody);

### Parameters

position | The position from which to find the closest point on the specified `rigidbody`.  
---|---  
rigidbody | The Rigidbody on which to find the closest specified `position`.  
  
### Returns

**Vector2** A point on the perimeter of a Collider attached to the `rigidbody`
that is closest to the specified `position`.

### Description

Returns a point on the perimeter of all enabled Colliders attached to the
`rigidbody` that is closest to the specified `position`.

This function provides the ability to calculate the closest point of a
specified `position` to the perimeter of any enabled
[Collider2D](Collider2D.html) type attached to the specified
[Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html).  
  
In the case where the `position` is inside any of the enabled
[Collider2D](Collider2D.html) attached to the `rigidbody`, the input
`position` is returned instead.
