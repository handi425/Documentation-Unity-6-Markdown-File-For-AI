### Description

Combines multiple dependencies into a single dependency.

All job schedule methods for [IJob](Unity.Jobs.IJob.html) or
[IJobParallelFor](Unity.Jobs.IJobParallelFor.html) job types take a single
dependency. Sometimes you might need to express dependencies against multiple
running jobs at the same time. Use this method to combine a set of
dependencies into a single dependency that can be passed to a job.

    
    
    // Schedule 3 jobs, jobs a and b can run in parallel to each other,
    // job c will only run once both jobA and jobB has completed  
      
    // Schedule job a
    var jobA = new MyJob(...);
    var jobAHandle = jobA.Schedule();  
      
    // Schedule job b
    var jobB = new MyJob(...);
    var jobBHandle = jobB.Schedule();  
      
    // For job c, combine dependencies of job a and b
    // Then use that for scheduling the next job
    var jobC = new DependentJob(...);
    var dependency = [JobHandle.CombineDependencies](Unity.Jobs.JobHandle.CombineDependencies.html)(jobAHandle, jobBHandle);
    jobC.Schedule(dependency);
