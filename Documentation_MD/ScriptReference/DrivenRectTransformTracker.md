### Description

A component can be designed to drive a RectTransform. The
DrivenRectTransformTracker struct is used to specify which RectTransforms it
is driving.

Driving a RectTransform means that the values of the driven RectTransform are
controlled by that component. These driven values cannot be edited in the
Inspector (they are shown as disabled). They also won't be saved when saving a
Scene, which prevents undesired Scene file changes.  
  
Whenever the component is changing values of driven RectTransforms, it should
first call the Clear method and then use the Add method to add all
RectTransforms it is driving. The Clear method should also be called in the
OnDisable callback of the component.

### Public Methods

[Add](DrivenRectTransformTracker.Add.html)| Add a RectTransform to be driven.  
---|---  
[Clear](DrivenRectTransformTracker.Clear.html)| Clear the list of
RectTransforms being driven.  
  
### Static Methods

[StartRecordingUndo](DrivenRectTransformTracker.StartRecordingUndo.html)|
Resume recording undo of driven RectTransforms.  
---|---  
[StopRecordingUndo](DrivenRectTransformTracker.StopRecordingUndo.html)| Stop
recording undo actions from driven RectTransforms.
