### Description

Indicates that Unity should not recalculate the bounds when you set Mesh data
using [Mesh.SetSubMesh](Mesh.SetSubMesh.html).

When you use [Mesh.SetSubMesh](Mesh.SetSubMesh.html) to modify a Mesh's data,
Unity's default behaviour is to re-calculate the values of the
[SubMeshDescriptor.bounds](Rendering.SubMeshDescriptor-bounds.html),
SubMeshDescriptor.startVertex and
[SubMeshDescriptor.vertexCount](Rendering.SubMeshDescriptor-vertexCount.html)
fields from the current vertex and index buffer data.  
  
You can make Unity skip these calculations by using the
`MeshUpdateFlags.DontRecalculateBounds` flag. This can be beneficial to
performance, however if you use this flag you must make sure that you pass
correct values of the `bounds`, `startVertex` and `vertexCount` fields.
