## Declaration

public static void SetRenderTarget([RenderTexture](RenderTexture.html) rt, int
mipLevel = 0, [CubemapFace](CubemapFace.html) face = CubemapFace.Unknown, int
depthSlice = 0);

## Declaration

public static void
SetRenderTarget([Rendering.GraphicsTexture](Rendering.GraphicsTexture.html)
rt, int mipLevel = 0, [CubemapFace](CubemapFace.html) face =
CubemapFace.Unknown, int depthSlice = 0);

## Declaration

public static void SetRenderTarget(RenderBuffer[] colorBuffers,
[RenderBuffer](RenderBuffer.html) depthBuffer);

## Declaration

public static void SetRenderTarget([RenderBuffer](RenderBuffer.html)
colorBuffer, [RenderBuffer](RenderBuffer.html) depthBuffer, int mipLevel = 0,
[CubemapFace](CubemapFace.html) face = CubemapFace.Unknown, int depthSlice =
0);

## Declaration

public static void SetRenderTarget([RenderTargetSetup](RenderTargetSetup.html)
setup);

### Parameters

rt |  [RenderTexture](RenderTexture.html) or [GraphicsTexture](Rendering.GraphicsTexture.html) to set as active render target.  
---|---  
mipLevel | Mipmap level to render into (use 0 if not mipmapped).  
face | Cubemap face to render into (use Unknown if not a cubemap).  
depthSlice | Depth slice to render into (use 0 if not a 3D or 2DArray render target).  
colorBuffer | Color buffer to render into.  
depthBuffer | Depth buffer to render into.  
colorBuffers | Color buffers to render into (for multiple render target effects).  
setup | Full render target setup information.  
  
### Description

Sets current render target.

This function sets which [RenderTexture](RenderTexture.html),
[GraphicsTexture](Rendering.GraphicsTexture.html), or a
[RenderBuffer](RenderBuffer.html) combination will be rendered into next. Use
it when implementing custom rendering algorithms, where you need to render
something into a render target texture manually.  
  
Variants with mipLevel and face arguments enable rendering into a specific
mipmap level of a texture, or specific cubemap face of a cubemap
RenderTexture/GraphicsTexture. Variants with depthSlice allow rendering into a
specific slice of a 3D or 2DArray render texture.  
  
The function call with colorBuffers array enables techniques that use Multiple
Render Targets (MRT), where fragment shader can output more than one final
color.  
  
Calling SetRenderTarget with just a RenderTexture or GraphicsTexture argument
is the same as setting the [RenderTexture.active](RenderTexture-active.html)
and [GraphicsTexture.active](Rendering.GraphicsTexture-active.html) property.
To set a GraphicsTexture as the render target, it must have
GraphicsTextureDescFlags.RenderTarget enabled in
GraphicsTexture.descriptor.flags.  
  
Note that in Linear color space, it is important to have the correct
sRGB<->Linear color conversion state set. Depending on what was rendered
previously, the current state might not be the one you expect. You should
consider setting [GL.sRGBWrite](GL-sRGBWrite.html) as you need it before doing
SetRenderTarget or any other manual rendering.
