## Declaration

public void
Finish([Actions.EditorActionResult](Actions.EditorActionResult.html) result);

### Parameters

result | The state that the [EditorAction](Actions.EditorAction.html) was finished in.  
---|---  
  
### Description

Finishes an [EditorAction](Actions.EditorAction.html) with a specific result.

Call this method to forcibly end an active
[EditorAction](Actions.EditorAction.html) with a
[EditorActionResult](Actions.EditorActionResult.html). A common use is when
implementing atomic actions that do not require interactivity.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);
    using UnityEditor.Actions;
    
    public class SingleFrameActionSample : [EditorAction](Actions.EditorAction.html)
    {
        [[MenuItem](MenuItem.html)("Test/Start Single Frame [Action](Unity.Android.Gradle.Manifest.Action.html)")]
        static void StartEditorActionSample()
        {
            Start(new SingleFrameActionSample(4));
        }
    
        int m_Value;
    
        public SingleFrameActionSample(int value)
        {
            m_Value = value;
            Finish([EditorActionResult.Success](Actions.EditorActionResult.Success.html));
        }
    
        protected override void OnFinish([EditorActionResult](Actions.EditorActionResult.html) result)
        {
            m_Value += 2;
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)($"[Action](Unity.Android.Gradle.Manifest.Action.html) Finished [{result}] with value: {m_Value}");
        }
    }
