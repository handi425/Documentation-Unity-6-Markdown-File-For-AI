---|---  
[Shadowmask](MixedLightingMode.Shadowmask.html)| Mixed lights provide real-
time direct lighting. Indirect lighting gets baked into lightmaps and light
probes. Shadowmasks and light probe occlusion get generated for baked shadows.
The Shadowmask Mode used at run time can be set in the Quality Settings panel.  
[Subtractive](MixedLightingMode.Subtractive.html)| Mixed lights provide baked
direct and indirect lighting for static objects. Dynamic objects receive real-
time direct lighting and cast shadows on static objects using the main
directional light in the Scene.
