## Declaration

public static void CopyCount([GraphicsBuffer](GraphicsBuffer.html) src,
[GraphicsBuffer](GraphicsBuffer.html) dst, int dstOffsetBytes);

### Parameters

src | The source GraphicsBuffer.  
---|---  
dst | The destination GraphicsBuffer.  
dstOffsetBytes | The destination buffer offset in bytes.  
  
### Description

Copy the counter value of a GraphicsBuffer into another buffer.

Append/consume buffers (see
[GraphicsBuffer.Target.Append](GraphicsBuffer.Target.Append.html) and counter
buffers [GraphicsBuffer.Target.Counter](GraphicsBuffer.Target.Counter.html))
keep track of the number of elements in them with a special counter variable.
CopyCount takes such a buffer as `src`, and copies its counter value into
`dst` buffer at given byte offset.  
  
This is most commonly used in conjunction with
[Graphics.RenderPrimitivesIndirect](Graphics.RenderPrimitivesIndirect.html),
to render an arbitrary number of primitives without reading their count back
to the CPU.  
  
The `src` buffer must have been created with a usage target of
[GraphicsBuffer.Target.Append](GraphicsBuffer.Target.Append.html) or
[GraphicsBuffer.Target.Counter](GraphicsBuffer.Target.Counter.html).  
  
On DirectX 11 and 12, the `dst` buffer must have been created with a usage
target of [GraphicsBuffer.Target.Raw](GraphicsBuffer.Target.Raw.html) or
[GraphicsBuffer.Target.IndirectArguments](GraphicsBuffer.Target.IndirectArguments.html).
For other graphics APIs, there is no such restriction.  
  
Additional resources: [SetCounterValue](GraphicsBuffer.SetCounterValue.html).
