### Description

The humanoid stream of animation data passed from one
[Playable](Playables.Playable.html) to another.

The AnimationHumanStream structure is passed through the animation
[Playable](Playables.Playable.html) structures, like
[AnimationClipPlayable](Animations.AnimationClipPlayable.html) and
[AnimationMixerPlayable](Animations.AnimationMixerPlayable.html). They can be
modified when used with an
[IAnimationJobPlayable](Animations.IAnimationJobPlayable.html), like the
[AnimationScriptPlayable](Animations.AnimationScriptPlayable.html).  
  
The Playables implementing
[IAnimationJobPlayable](Animations.IAnimationJobPlayable.html) take a custom
C# job, which must implement [IAnimationJob](Animations.IAnimationJob.html),
and the AnimationHumanStream is then passed to its callbacks during the
animation processing pass.  
  
Additional resources: [AnimationStream](Animations.AnimationStream.html),
[AnimationStream.isHumanStream](Animations.AnimationStream-
isHumanStream.html), and AnimationStream.AsHuman().
