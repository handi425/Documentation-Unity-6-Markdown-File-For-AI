public static double unscaledTimeAsDouble;

### Description

The double precision timeScale-independent time for this frame (Read Only).
This is the time in seconds since the start of the game.

Double precision version of [unscaledTime](Time-unscaledTime.html). This
offers more precision than a float or single value, particularly over extended
periods of real-world time. In almost all cases, use the
`unscaledTimeAsDouble` equivalent over [unscaledTime](Time-unscaledTime.html).  
  
When called from inside MonoBehaviour's
[FixedUpdate](MonoBehaviour.FixedUpdate.html), it returns the unscaled fixed
time.  
  
Returns the same value if called multiple times in a single frame. Unlike
[timeAsDouble](Time-timeAsDouble.html) this value is not affected by
[timeScale](Time-timeScale.html).

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
