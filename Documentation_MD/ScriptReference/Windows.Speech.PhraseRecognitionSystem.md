### Description

Phrase recognition system is responsible for managing phrase recognizers and
dispatching recognition events to them.

In order for any phrase recognizers to recognize a phrase,
PhraseRecognitionSystem must be running. Starting a phrase recognition will
automatically start the phrase recognition system if it's stopped.  
  
Phrase recognition system cannot be started if there are any dictation
recognizers active.  
  
Phrase recognition system is currently only functional on Windows 10. Use
PhraseRecognitionSystem.isSupported property to determine whether speech
recognition is supported on the system that the application is running on.
