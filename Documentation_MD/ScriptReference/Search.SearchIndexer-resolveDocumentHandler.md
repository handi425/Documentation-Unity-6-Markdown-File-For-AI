public Func<string,string> resolveDocumentHandler;

### Description

Handler used to resolve a document ID to some other data string.

    /// Since the search indexes only contain string document IDs that must be unique,
    /// you can use `resolveDocumentHandler` to transform these document IDs into something
    /// that can be searched while running queries that contain simple words.
    /// </summary>
