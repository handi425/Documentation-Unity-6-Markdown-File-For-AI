[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-TextAsset.html "Go to TextAsset Component
in the Manual")

public string text;

### Description

The text contents of the file as a string. (Read Only)

Encodings are detected and interpreted automatically. Supported encodings are:

  * UTF-32 Big or Little Endian with a byte order mark,
  * UTF-16 Big or Little Endian with a byte order mark,
  * UTF-8 with a byte order mark,
  * UTF-8 without a byte order mark. This encoding is used as a fallback, if the above encodings can't decode the file without missing characters.

To use a specific encoding to decode a file, use [TextAsset.bytes](TextAsset-
bytes.html) and C# encoding classes.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        [TextAsset](TextAsset.html) asset;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)(asset.text);
        }
    }

[GetData](TextAsset.GetData.html), [Text Assets](../Manual/class-
TextAsset.html).
