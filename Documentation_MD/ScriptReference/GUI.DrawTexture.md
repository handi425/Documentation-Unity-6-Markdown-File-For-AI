## Declaration

public static void DrawTexture([Rect](Rect.html) position,
[Texture](Texture.html) image);

## Declaration

public static void DrawTexture([Rect](Rect.html) position,
[Texture](Texture.html) image, [ScaleMode](ScaleMode.html) scaleMode);

## Declaration

public static void DrawTexture([Rect](Rect.html) position,
[Texture](Texture.html) image, [ScaleMode](ScaleMode.html) scaleMode, bool
alphaBlend);

## Declaration

public static void DrawTexture([Rect](Rect.html) position,
[Texture](Texture.html) image, [ScaleMode](ScaleMode.html) scaleMode, bool
alphaBlend, float imageAspect);

### Parameters

position | Rectangle on the screen to draw the texture within.  
---|---  
image |  [Texture](Texture.html) to display.  
scaleMode | How to scale the image when the aspect ratio of it doesn't fit the aspect ratio to be drawn within.  
alphaBlend | Whether to apply alpha blending when drawing the image (enabled by default).  
imageAspect | Aspect ratio to use for the source image. If 0 (the default), the aspect ratio from the image is used. Pass in w/h for the desired aspect ratio. This allows the aspect ratio of the source image to be adjusted without changing the pixel width and height.  
  
### Description

Draw a texture within a rectangle.

Additional resources: [GUI.color](GUI-color.html), [GUI.contentColor](GUI-
contentColor.html).

    
    
    // Draws a texture in the left corner of the screen.
    // The texture is drawn in a window 60x60 pixels.
    // The source texture is given an aspect ratio of 10x1
    // and scaled to fit in the 60x60 rectangle.  Because
    // the aspect ratio is preserved, the texture will fit
    // inside a 60x10 pixel area of the screen rectangle.  
      
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public [Texture](Texture.html) aTexture;  
      
        void OnGUI()
        {
            if (!aTexture)
            {
                [Debug.LogError](Debug.LogError.html)("Assign a [Texture](Texture.html) in the inspector.");
                return;
            }  
      
            [GUI.DrawTexture](GUI.DrawTexture.html)(new [Rect](Rect.html)(10, 10, 60, 60), aTexture, [ScaleMode.ScaleToFit](ScaleMode.ScaleToFit.html), true, 10.0F);
        }
    }

## Declaration

public static void DrawTexture([Rect](Rect.html) position,
[Texture](Texture.html) image, [ScaleMode](ScaleMode.html) scaleMode, bool
alphaBlend, float imageAspect, [Color](Color.html) color, float borderWidth,
float borderRadius);

## Declaration

public static void DrawTexture([Rect](Rect.html) position,
[Texture](Texture.html) image, [ScaleMode](ScaleMode.html) scaleMode, bool
alphaBlend, float imageAspect, [Color](Color.html) color,
[Vector4](Vector4.html) borderWidths, float borderRadius);

### Parameters

position | Rectangle on the screen to draw the texture within.  
---|---  
image |  [Texture](Texture.html) to display.  
scaleMode | How to scale the image when the aspect ratio of it doesn't fit the aspect ratio to be drawn within.  
alphaBlend | Whether to apply alpha blending when drawing the image (enabled by default).  
imageAspect | Aspect ratio to use for the source image. If 0 (the default), the aspect ratio from the image is used. Pass in w/h for the desired aspect ratio. This allows the aspect ratio of the source image to be adjusted without changing the pixel width and height.  
color | A tint color to apply on the texture.  
borderWidth | The width of the border. If 0, the full texture is drawn.  
borderWidths | The width of the borders (left, top, right and bottom). If Vector4.zero, the full texture is drawn.  
borderRadius | The radius for rounded corners. If 0, corners will not be rounded.  
borderRadiuses | The radiuses for rounded corners (top-left, top-right, bottom-right and bottom-left). If Vector4.zero, corners will not be rounded.  
  
### Description

Draws a border with rounded corners within a rectangle. The texture is used to
pattern the border. Note that this method only works on shader model 2.5 and
above.
