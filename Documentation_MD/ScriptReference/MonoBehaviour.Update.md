[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-MonoBehaviour.html "Go to MonoBehaviour
Component in the Manual")

### Description

Update is called every frame, if the MonoBehaviour is enabled.

`Update` is the most commonly used function to implement any kind of game
script. Not every `MonoBehaviour` script needs `Update`.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    // The ExampleClass starts with Awake.  The [GameObject](GameObject.html) class has activeSelf
    // set to false.  When activeSelf is set to true the Start() and [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
    // functions will be called causing the ExampleClass to run.
    // Note that ExampleClass (Script) in the Inspector is turned off.  It
    // needs to be ticked to make script call Start.  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        private float update;  
      
        void Awake()
        {
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("Awake");
            update = 0.0f;
        }  
      
        IEnumerator Start()
        {
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("Start1");
            yield return new [WaitForSeconds](WaitForSeconds.html)(2.5f);
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("Start2");
        }  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            update += [Time.deltaTime](Time-deltaTime.html);
            if (update > 1.0f)
            {
                update = 0.0f;
                [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("[Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)");
            }
        }
    }
    

In order to get the elapsed time since last call to Update, use
[Time.deltaTime](Time-deltaTime.html). This function is only called if the
[Behaviour](Behaviour.html) is enabled. Override this function in order to
provide your component's functionality.
