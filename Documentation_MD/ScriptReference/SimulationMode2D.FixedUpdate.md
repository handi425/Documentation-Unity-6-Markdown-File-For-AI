### Description

Use this enumeration to specify to Unity that it should execute the physics
simulation immediately after the
[MonoBehaviour.FixedUpdate](MonoBehaviour.FixedUpdate.html).

Executing the physics simulation during
[MonoBehaviour.FixedUpdate](MonoBehaviour.FixedUpdate.html) provides the most
stable physics simulation however, Unity may render multiple frames between
simulation updates. This means that changes made per-frame may not be
synchronized with the physics simulation including contacts between
[Collider2D](Collider2D.html). In this mode [Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html)
interpolation should be used to provide smoother movement per-frame where
appropriate.
