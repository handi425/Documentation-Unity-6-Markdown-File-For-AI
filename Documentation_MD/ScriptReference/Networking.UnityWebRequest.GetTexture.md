**Obsolete** UnityWebRequest.GetTexture is obsolete. Use
UnityWebRequestTexture.GetTexture instead.  
**Upgrade to[GetTexture](Networking.UnityWebRequestTexture.GetTexture.html)**

## Declaration

public static [Networking.UnityWebRequest](Networking.UnityWebRequest.html)
GetTexture(string uri);

**Obsolete** UnityWebRequest.GetTexture is obsolete. Use
UnityWebRequestTexture.GetTexture instead.  
**Upgrade to[GetTexture](Networking.UnityWebRequestTexture.GetTexture.html)**

## Declaration

public static [Networking.UnityWebRequest](Networking.UnityWebRequest.html)
GetTexture(string uri, bool nonReadable);

### Parameters

uri | The URI of the image to download.  
---|---  
nonReadable | If true, the texture's raw data will not be accessible to script. This can conserve memory. Default: `false`.  
  
### Returns

**UnityWebRequest** A [UnityWebRequest](Networking.UnityWebRequest.html)
properly configured to download an image and convert it to a
[Texture](Texture.html).

### Description

Creates a [UnityWebRequest](Networking.UnityWebRequest.html) intended to
download an image via HTTP GET and create a [Texture](Texture.html) based on
the retrieved data.

**Obsolete** \- instead use
[UnityWebRequestTexture.GetTexture](Networking.UnityWebRequestTexture.GetTexture.html).  
  
This method creates a [UnityWebRequest](Networking.UnityWebRequest.html) and
sets the target URL to the string `uri` argument. This method sets no other
flags or custom headers.  
  
This method attaches a
[DownloadHandlerTexture](Networking.DownloadHandlerTexture.html) object to the
[UnityWebRequest](Networking.UnityWebRequest.html).
[DownloadHandlerTexture](Networking.DownloadHandlerTexture.html) is a
specialized [DownloadHandler](Networking.DownloadHandler.html) which is
optimized for storing images which are to be used as textures in the Unity
Engine. Using this class significantly reduces memory reallocation compared to
downloading raw bytes and creating a texture manually in script. In addition,
texture conversion will be performed on a worker thread.  
  
This method attaches no [UploadHandler](Networking.UploadHandler.html) to the
[UnityWebRequest](Networking.UnityWebRequest.html).  
  
UnityWebRequest.GetTexture is obsolete. Use UnityWebRequestTexture.GetTexture
instead.
