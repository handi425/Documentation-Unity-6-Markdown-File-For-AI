public float outWeight;

### Description

Sets the outgoing weight for this key. The outgoing weight affects the slope
of the curve from this key to the next key.

The weight is a value between 0 and 1. Set [weightedMode](Keyframe-
weightedMode.html) to [WeightedMode.Out](WeightedMode.Out.html) or
[WeightedMode.Both](WeightedMode.Both.html) to include weight when calculating
the slope of the outgoing curve.  
  
Additional resources: [inWeight](Keyframe-inWeight.html).

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class KeyFrameWeightExample : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        [AnimationCurve](AnimationCurve.html)  animCurve = null;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            [Keyframe](Keyframe.html)[] ks = new [Keyframe](Keyframe.html)[3];  
      
            ks[0] = new [Keyframe](Keyframe.html)(0, 0);
            ks[0].weightedMode = [WeightedMode.Out](WeightedMode.Out.html);
            ks[0].outWeight = 0.5f;  
      
            ks[1] = new [Keyframe](Keyframe.html)(4, 0);
            ks[1].weightedMode = [WeightedMode.Out](WeightedMode.Out.html);
            ks[1].outWeight = 0f;    // Zero weight.  The segment will be linear if next keyframe [inWeight](Keyframe-inWeight.html) is also zero.  
      
            ks[2] = new [Keyframe](Keyframe.html)(6, 0);
            ks[2].weightedMode = [WeightedMode.Out](WeightedMode.Out.html);
            ks[2].outWeight = 1f / 3f;    // 1/3 is the default weight in [WeightedMode.None](WeightedMode.None.html) weightedMode.  
      
            animCurve = new [AnimationCurve](AnimationCurve.html)(ks);
        }  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            if (animCurve != null)
                transform.position = new [Vector3](Vector3.html)([Time.time](Time-time.html), animCurve.Evaluate([Time.time](Time-time.html)), 0);
        }
