public float trueHeading;

### Description

The heading in degrees relative to the geographic North Pole. (Read Only)

The value in this property is always measured relative to the top of the
screen in its current orientation. Note, that if you want this property to
contain a valid value, you must also enable location updates by calling
`Input.location.Start()`. (Read Only)  
  
**Note:** On the web platform this property will return the magnetic heading.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    public class Example : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            // Orient an object to point northward.
            transform.rotation = [Quaternion.Euler](Quaternion.Euler.html)(0, -Input.compass.trueHeading, 0);
        }
    }
