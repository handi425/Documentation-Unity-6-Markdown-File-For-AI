## Declaration

public static int NewStaticSafetyId(byte* ownerTypeNameBytes, int byteCount);

### Parameters

ownerTypeNameBytes | The name of the scripting type that owns the [AtomicSafetyHandle](Unity.Collections.LowLevel.Unsafe.AtomicSafetyHandle.html), to be embedded in error messages involving the handle. This must be a UTF8-encoded byte array, and doesn't have to be null-terminated.  
---|---  
byteCount | The number of bytes in the `ownerTypeNameBytes` array, excluding the optional null terminator.  
  
### Returns

**int** The newly allocated safety ID.

### Description

Allocates a new static safety ID to store information for the provided type.

After creating a new static safety ID, use
[SetStaticSafetyId](Unity.Collections.LowLevel.Unsafe.AtomicSafetyHandle.SetStaticSafetyId.html)
to assign it to the applicable
[AtomicSafetyHandle](Unity.Collections.LowLevel.Unsafe.AtomicSafetyHandle.html)
instances.  
  
The job debugger uses this static safety ID to look up the provided type's
name, and any custom error messages created with
[SetCustomErrorMessage](Unity.Collections.LowLevel.Unsafe.AtomicSafetyHandle.SetCustomErrorMessage.html).
Without this information, the job debugger can only give general error
messages that might not clearly identify the source of the error.
