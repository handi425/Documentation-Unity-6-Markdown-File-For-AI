[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-Camera.html "Go to Camera Component in the
Manual")

public [Matrix4x4](Matrix4x4.html) worldToCameraMatrix;

### Description

Matrix that transforms from world to camera space.

This matrix is often referred to as "view matrix" in graphics literature.  
  
Use this to calculate the Camera space position of GameObjects or to provide a
custom Camera's location that is not based on the transform.  
  
Note that camera space matches OpenGL convention: camera's forward is the
negative Z axis. This is different from Unity's convention, where forward is
the positive Z axis.  
  
If you change this matrix, the camera no longer updates its rendering based on
its [Transform](Transform.html). This lasts until you call
[ResetWorldToCameraMatrix](Camera.ResetWorldToCameraMatrix.html).

    
    
    // Offsets camera's rendering from the transform's position.
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public [Vector3](Vector3.html) offset = new [Vector3](Vector3.html)(0, 1, 0);
        [Camera](Camera.html) cam;  
      
        void Start()
        {
            cam = GetComponent<[Camera](Camera.html)>();
        }  
      
        void LateUpdate()
        {
            [Vector3](Vector3.html) camoffset = new [Vector3](Vector3.html)(-offset.x, -offset.y, offset.z);
            [Matrix4x4](Matrix4x4.html) m = [Matrix4x4.TRS](Matrix4x4.TRS.html)(camoffset, [Quaternion.identity](Quaternion-identity.html), new [Vector3](Vector3.html)(1, 1, -1));
            cam.worldToCameraMatrix = m * transform.worldToLocalMatrix;
        }
    }
