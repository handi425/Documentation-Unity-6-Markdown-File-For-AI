## Declaration

public void DispatchCompute([ComputeShader](ComputeShader.html) computeShader,
int kernelIndex, int threadGroupsX, int threadGroupsY, int threadGroupsZ);

## Declaration

public void DispatchCompute([ComputeShader](ComputeShader.html) computeShader,
int kernelIndex, [ComputeBuffer](ComputeBuffer.html) indirectBuffer, uint
argsOffset);

## Declaration

public void DispatchCompute([ComputeShader](ComputeShader.html) computeShader,
int kernelIndex, [GraphicsBuffer](GraphicsBuffer.html) indirectBuffer, uint
argsOffset);

### Parameters

computeShader |  [ComputeShader](ComputeShader.html) to execute.  
---|---  
kernelIndex | Kernel index to execute, see [ComputeShader.FindKernel](ComputeShader.FindKernel.html).  
threadGroupsX | Number of work groups in the X dimension.  
threadGroupsY | Number of work groups in the Y dimension.  
threadGroupsZ | Number of work groups in the Z dimension.  
indirectBuffer |  [ComputeBuffer](ComputeBuffer.html) with dispatch arguments.  
argsOffset | Byte offset indicating the location of the dispatch arguments in the buffer.  
  
### Description

Add a command to execute a [ComputeShader](ComputeShader.html).

When the command buffer executes, a compute shader kernel is dispatched, with
work group size either specified directly (see
[ComputeShader.Dispatch](ComputeShader.Dispatch.html)) or read from the GPU
buffer (see
[ComputeShader.DispatchIndirect](ComputeShader.DispatchIndirect.html)).
