### Description

Specify which struct method and property requires write access to be invoked.

Used in conjunction with the
[ReadOnlyAttribute](Unity.Collections.ReadOnlyAttribute.html),
WriteAccessRequiredAttribute lets you specify which struct method and property
requires write access to be invoked. When you add the
[ReadOnly](Unity.Collections.NativeArray_1.ReadOnly.html) attribute to a
native container, it indicates that only operations that read data can be
performed on the native container, and you can't use methods and properties on
the native container that modify the array. The `WriteAccessRequired`
attribute indicates which methods and properties can't be used on a native
container with the [ReadOnly](Unity.Collections.NativeArray_1.ReadOnly.html)
attribute.

    
    
    using Unity.Collections.LowLevel.Unsafe;
    using Unity.Collections;
    using UnityEngine;  
      
    [NativeContainer]
    public struct MyList<T> where T : struct
    {
        public int [Length](UIElements.Length.html) { get; private set; }  
      
        [WriteAccessRequired]
        public void Grow(int capacity)
        {
            // ...
        }
    }  
      
    public class MyMonoBehaviour : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        [[ReadOnly](Unity.Collections.NativeArray_1.ReadOnly.html)]
        MyList<int> readOnlyList;  
      
        MyList<int> writableList = new MyList<int>();  
      
        public void OnUpdate()
        {
            writableList.Grow(10); // Ok
            readOnlyList.Grow(10); // Illegal
        }
    }
