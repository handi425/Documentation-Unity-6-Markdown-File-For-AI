### Description

Decides whether the Workflow in the Physics Debug window should be
`inclusive/`
([ShowSelectedItems](PhysicsVisualizationSettings.FilterWorkflow.ShowSelectedItems.html))
or `exclusive`
([HideSelectedItems](PhysicsVisualizationSettings.FilterWorkflow.HideSelectedItems.html)).

By default
[HideSelectedItems](PhysicsVisualizationSettings.FilterWorkflow.HideSelectedItems.html)
is chosen and none of filtering items are selected. This means that nothing is
hidden and thus everything is visible.  
  
Additional resources: PhysicsVisualizationSettings.filterWorkflow.

### Properties

[HideSelectedItems](PhysicsVisualizationSettings.FilterWorkflow.HideSelectedItems.html)|
With HideSelectedItems you can hide selected filter items in order to easily
discard uninteresting Collider properties thereby making overview and
navigation easier.  
---|---  
[ShowSelectedItems](PhysicsVisualizationSettings.FilterWorkflow.ShowSelectedItems.html)|
With ShowSelectedItems and the Select None button is it easy to monitor very
specific Colliders.
