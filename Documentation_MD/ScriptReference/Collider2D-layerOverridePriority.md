public int layerOverridePriority;

### Description

A decision priority assigned to this [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) used when
there is a conflicting decision on whether a contact between itself and
another [Collision2D](Collision2D.html) should happen or not.

The Layer Collision Matrix defines which Layers can and cannot contact other
Layers. Addition Layer includes and excludes can be made per
[Collider2D](Collider2D.html) or all [Collider2D](Collider2D.html) attached to
a specific [Rigidbody2D](Rigidbody2D.html). Any contact involves two different
[Collider2D](Collider2D.html) instances. Unfortunately this can result in one
[Collider2D](Collider2D.html) deciding that it should contact the other
[Collider2D](Collider2D.html) but the other [Collider2D](Collider2D.html)
deciding it should not. There are rules however in determining and ultimately
arbitrating the final decision on whether a contact should be created or not.  
  
The rules for a making a decision for contact between two
[Collider2D](Collider2D.html), referred to here as A and B, are made in the
following order:

  1. If both A and B make the same decision then use that decision.
  2. If only A or B are using a Layer include or exclude then use the decision for A or B that has include or exclude specified.
  3. If both A and B are using a Layer include or exclude then use the decision from A or B that has the higher [Collider2D.layerOverridePriority](Collider2D-layerOverridePriority.html).
  4. If A and B have the same [Collider2D.layerOverridePriority](Collider2D-layerOverridePriority.html) then the decision will be to not create a contact.
