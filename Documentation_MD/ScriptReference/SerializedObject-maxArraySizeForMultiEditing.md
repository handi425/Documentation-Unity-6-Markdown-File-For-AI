public int maxArraySizeForMultiEditing;

### Description

Defines the maximum size beyond which arrays cannot be edited when multiple
objects are selected.

This value controls the maximum array size that you can edit during multiple-
object-editing in the Inspector.  
  
When you select two or more GameObjects and the minimum array size for a
property is larger than this value, the Inspector shows an empty array and
[SerializedProperty.arraySize](SerializedProperty-arraySize.html) returns 0.
In that case, [SerializedProperty.minArraySize](SerializedProperty-
minArraySize.html) exposes the actual minimum size.  
  
As a compromise between performance and utility, the default array size is 64.  
  
If your serialized object typically has arrays larger than this, you can set
this value to a higher number to allow multi-editing on those arrays. Please
be aware that setting too high a value might affect Inspector performance when
editing large arrays or a large number of objects.
