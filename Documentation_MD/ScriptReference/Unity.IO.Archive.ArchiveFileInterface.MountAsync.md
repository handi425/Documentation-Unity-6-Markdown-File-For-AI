## Declaration

public static
[Unity.IO.Archive.ArchiveHandle](Unity.IO.Archive.ArchiveHandle.html)
MountAsync([Unity.Content.ContentNamespace](Unity.Content.ContentNamespace.html)
namespaceId, string filePath, string prefix);

### Parameters

namespaceId | ContentNamespace identifier.  
---|---  
filePath | Path of the archive on disk.  
prefix | Mount point identifier. Set to an empty string if no prefix should be used.  
  
### Returns

**ArchiveHandle** Returns an operation handle that references the archive.

### Description

Loads all files in an archive to a mount point.

The mounted files can only be accessed through APIs that use Unity's virtual
file system such as
[AsyncReadManager](Unity.IO.LowLevel.Unsafe.AsyncReadManager.html). They
cannot be accessed through the regular C# APIs such as System.IO.
