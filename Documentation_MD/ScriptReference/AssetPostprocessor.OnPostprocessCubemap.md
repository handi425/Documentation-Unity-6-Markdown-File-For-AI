### Description

Add this function to a subclass to get a notification just before a cubemap
texture has completed importing.

Note that you should avoid modifying the TextureImporter settings in this
manner as it would have no effect on the texture that is currently being
imported but would apply the next time the texture is imported. This behavior
is nondeterministic and therefore undesirable.

    
    
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);
    using UnityEngine;

    // Postprocesses all cubemaps that are placed in a folder
    // Here we just halve the texels values
    public class ProcessCubemap : [AssetPostprocessor](AssetPostprocessor.html)
    {
        void OnPostprocessCubemap([Cubemap](Cubemap.html) texture)
        {
            string lowerCaseAssetPath = assetPath.ToLower();
            if (lowerCaseAssetPath.IndexOf("/postprocessedcubemaps/") == -1)
                return;  
      
            for (int m = 0; m < texture.mipmapCount; m++)

                for (int face = 0; face < 6; face++)
                {
                    [CubemapFace](CubemapFace.html) f = ([CubemapFace](CubemapFace.html))face;
                    [Color](Color.html)[] c = texture.GetPixels(f, m);  
      
                    for (int i = 0; i < c.Length; i++)
                    {
                        c[i].r = c[i].r * 0.5f;
                        c[i].g = c[i].g * 0.5f;
                        c[i].b = c[i].b * 0.5f;

                    texture.SetPixels(c, f, m);
                }
                // Instead of setting pixels for each mipmap level, you can also
                // modify only the pixels in the highest mip level. And then simply use
                // texture.Apply(true); to generate lower mip levels.
            }
        }
