### Description

Trigger when any [Sprite](Sprite.html) was bound to
[SpriteAtlas](U2D.SpriteAtlas.html) but couldn't locate the atlas asset during
runtime.

This usually means the sprite was packed to an atlas which is not included in
build  
  
This callback does not expect an immediate response from the user. Instead, it
passes on a System.Action. The user can load the atlas object later and use
this System.Action to pass back the loaded atlas.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using UnityEngine.U2D;  
      
    public class AtlasLoader : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void OnEnable()
        {
            [SpriteAtlasManager.atlasRequested](U2D.SpriteAtlasManager-atlasRequested.html) += RequestAtlas;
        }  
      
        void OnDisable()
        {
            [SpriteAtlasManager.atlasRequested](U2D.SpriteAtlasManager-atlasRequested.html) -= RequestAtlas;
        }  
      
        void RequestAtlas(string tag, System.Action<[SpriteAtlas](U2D.SpriteAtlas.html)> callback)
        {
            var sa = [Resources.Load](Resources.Load.html)<[SpriteAtlas](U2D.SpriteAtlas.html)>(tag);
            callback(sa);
        }
    }
