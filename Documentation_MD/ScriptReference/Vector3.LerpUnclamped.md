## Declaration

public static [Vector3](Vector3.html) LerpUnclamped([Vector3](Vector3.html) a,
[Vector3](Vector3.html) b, float t);

### Description

Linearly interpolates between two vectors.

Interpolates between the vectors `a` and `b` by the interpolant `t`. This is
most commonly used to find a point some fraction of the way along a line
between two endpoints (e.g. to move an object gradually between those points).  
  
When `t` = 0 returns `a`. When `t` = 1 returns `b`. When `t` = 0.5 returns the
point midway between `a` and `b`.
