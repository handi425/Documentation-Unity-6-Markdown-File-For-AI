### Description

OverlayCanvas is a container for collections of
[Overlay](Overlays.Overlay.html)s.

Every [EditorWindow](EditorWindow.html) has an
[OverlayCanvas](Overlays.OverlayCanvas.html), but only windows that opt-in to
Overlay support will display Overlays. See
[ISupportsOverlays](Overlays.ISupportsOverlays.html) for more information.

### Properties

[overlays](Overlays.OverlayCanvas-overlays.html)| The Overlays in this canvas.  
---|---  
[overlaysEnabled](Overlays.OverlayCanvas-overlaysEnabled.html)| Returns true
if overlays display in the window, or false if overlays are hidden.  
  
### Public Methods

[Add](Overlays.OverlayCanvas.Add.html)| Add an Overlay to this canvas. Added
Overlays will be displayed in the associated EditorWindow until they are
removed.  
---|---  
[OnAfterDeserialize](Overlays.OverlayCanvas.OnAfterDeserialize.html)| Invoked
after OverlayCanvas is deserialized.  
[OnBeforeSerialize](Overlays.OverlayCanvas.OnBeforeSerialize.html)| Invoked
before OverlayCanvas will be serialized. This is used to store Overlay layout
data.  
[Remove](Overlays.OverlayCanvas.Remove.html)| Remove an Overlay from this
canvas. Removed Overlays are disassociated from OverlayCanvas and the related
EditorWindow, but not destroyed. This means you are able to move a single
Overlay between multiple windows.  
[ResetOverlay](Overlays.OverlayCanvas.ResetOverlay.html)| Resets the overlay
to its default state.  
[RestoreOverlay](Overlays.OverlayCanvas.RestoreOverlay.html)| Restores Overlay
state according to the data parameter.  
[ShowPopup](Overlays.OverlayCanvas.ShowPopup.html)| Displays an overlay as a
pop-up in a EditorWindow.  
[ShowPopupAtMouse](Overlays.OverlayCanvas.ShowPopupAtMouse.html)| Displays an
overlay as a pop-up in a EditorWindow at the mouse position.
