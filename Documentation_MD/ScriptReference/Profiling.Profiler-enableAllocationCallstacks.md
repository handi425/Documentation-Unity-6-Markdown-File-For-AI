public static bool enableAllocationCallstacks;

### Description

Enables the recording of callstacks for managed allocations.

When enabled, the Unity player saves callstack for each managed allocation
sample which is known as _GC.Alloc_. You can see the callstacks in the
Timeline View or in the Object Details pane of the Hierarchy View when
selecting the _GC.Alloc_ sample.  
  
You must also set [Profiler.enabled](Profiling.Profiler-enabled.html) to
`true` in order to start the capture.

    
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;
    using UnityEngine.Profiling;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        void Start()
        {
            [Profiler.logFile](Profiling.Profiler-logFile.html) = "mylog"; //Also supports passing "myLog.raw"
            [Profiler.enableBinaryLog](Profiling.Profiler-enableBinaryLog.html) = true;
            [Profiler.enableAllocationCallstacks](Profiling.Profiler-enableAllocationCallstacks.html) = true;
            [Profiler.enabled](Profiling.Profiler-enabled.html) = true;  
      
            // Optional, if more memory is needed for the buffer
            [Profiler.maxUsedMemory](Profiling.Profiler-maxUsedMemory.html) = 256 * 1024 * 1024;
        }
    }
    

**Note:** Callstacks capture adds noticable performance overhead to the
profiling for every managed allocation.
