public bool gameObjectsNotMatchedBecomesOverride;

### Description

If a GameObject is not matched up then it can become an added GameObject on
the new Prefab instance. This property is only used when used together with
[ObjectMatchMode.ByHierarchy](ObjectMatchMode.ByHierarchy.html).

If this property is false then the GameObject will be deleted if it doesn't
match a GameObject on the PrefabAsset. Additional resources:
[componentsNotMatchedBecomesOverride](ConvertToPrefabInstanceSettings-
componentsNotMatchedBecomesOverride.html),
[recordPropertyOverridesOfMatches](ConvertToPrefabInstanceSettings-
recordPropertyOverridesOfMatches.html).
