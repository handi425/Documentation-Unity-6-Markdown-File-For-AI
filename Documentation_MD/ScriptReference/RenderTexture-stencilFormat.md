Component in the Manual")

public
[Experimental.Rendering.GraphicsFormat](Experimental.Rendering.GraphicsFormat.html)
stencilFormat;

### Description

The format of the stencil data that you can encapsulate within a
RenderTexture.  
  
Specifying this property creates a stencil element for the RenderTexture and
sets its format. This allows for stencil data to be bound as a Texture to all
shader types for the platforms that support it. This property does not specify
the format of the stencil buffer, which is constrained by the depth buffer
format specified in [RenderTexture.depth](RenderTexture-depth.html).  
  
Currently, most platforms only support `R8_UInt` (DirectX11, DirectX12).

[GraphicsFormat](Experimental.Rendering.GraphicsFormat.html),
[RenderTexture.depth](RenderTexture-depth.html).
