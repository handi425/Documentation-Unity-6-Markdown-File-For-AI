## Declaration

public void SetVertexBufferParams(int vertexCount, params
VertexAttributeDescriptor[] attributes);

## Declaration

public void SetVertexBufferParams(int vertexCount,
NativeArray<VertexAttributeDescriptor> attributes);

### Parameters

vertexCount | The number of vertices in the Mesh.  
---|---  
attributes | Layout of the vertex data: which attributes are present, their data types and so on.  
  
### Description

Sets the vertex buffer size and layout of the Mesh that Unity creates from the
`MeshData`.

Use this function to set vertex buffer size and layout for newly created Mesh
data (see
[Mesh.AllocateWritableMeshData](Mesh.AllocateWritableMeshData.html)). For
details, see [Mesh.SetVertexBufferParams](Mesh.SetVertexBufferParams.html).  
  
After you have set the vertex buffer parameters, you can write the vertices
into the array returned by
[Mesh.MeshData.GetVertexData](Mesh.MeshData.GetVertexData.html). If you call
this method on a read-only `MeshData`, Unity throws an exception.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
