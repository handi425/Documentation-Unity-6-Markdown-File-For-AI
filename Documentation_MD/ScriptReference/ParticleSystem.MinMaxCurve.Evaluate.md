## Declaration

public float Evaluate(float time);

## Declaration

public float Evaluate(float time, float lerpFactor);

### Parameters

time | Normalized time (in the range 0 - 1, where 1 represents 100%) at which to evaluate the curve. This is valid when [ParticleSystem.MinMaxCurve.mode](ParticleSystem.MinMaxCurve-mode.html) is set to [ParticleSystemCurveMode.Curve](ParticleSystemCurveMode.Curve.html) or [ParticleSystemCurveMode.TwoCurves](ParticleSystemCurveMode.TwoCurves.html).  
---|---  
lerpFactor | Blend between the two curves/constants (Valid when [ParticleSystem.MinMaxCurve.mode](ParticleSystem.MinMaxCurve-mode.html) is set to [ParticleSystemCurveMode.TwoConstants](ParticleSystemCurveMode.TwoConstants.html) or [ParticleSystemCurveMode.TwoCurves](ParticleSystemCurveMode.TwoCurves.html)).  
  
### Returns

**float** Calculated curve/constant value.

### Description

Manually query the curve to calculate values based on what mode it is in.

This automatically clamps the time and lerpFactor properties between 0 and 1.
