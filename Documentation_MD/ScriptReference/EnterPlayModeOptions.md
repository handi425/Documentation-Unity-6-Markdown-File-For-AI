### Description

Determines the flags for the Enter Play Mode Options in the Unity Editor.

### Properties

[None](EnterPlayModeOptions.None.html)| This makes Unity reload the .NET
Application Domain and entire Scene when entering Play Mode.  
---|---  
[DisableDomainReload](EnterPlayModeOptions.DisableDomainReload.html)| When
Domain Reload is disabled, scripts are not reloaded when entering Play Mode.
This makes it quicker to switch to Play Mode, because there's no need to
destroy, create and reload the .NET Application Domain.  
[DisableSceneReload](EnterPlayModeOptions.DisableSceneReload.html)| When Scene
Reload is disabled, Unity resets the Scene state and emulates all of the
required post-processor calls when entering Play Mode, instead of reloading
the whole Scene. This makes it quicker to switch to Play Mode, because there's
no need to destroy, create and awaken all the Scene objects, and serialize and
deserialize the Scene from disk.
