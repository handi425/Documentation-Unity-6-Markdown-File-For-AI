### Description

A container for audio data.

An AudioClip stores the audio file either compressed as ogg vorbis or
uncompressed. AudioClips are referenced and used by AudioSources to play
sounds.  
  
Additional resources: [AudioClip component](../Manual/class-AudioClip.html) in
the Components Reference.

### Properties

[ambisonic](AudioClip-ambisonic.html)| Returns true if this audio clip is
ambisonic (read-only).  
---|---  
[channels](AudioClip-channels.html)| The number of channels in the audio clip.
(Read Only)  
[frequency](AudioClip-frequency.html)| The sample frequency of the clip in
Hertz. (Read Only)  
[length](AudioClip-length.html)| The length of the audio clip in seconds.

[loadInBackground](AudioClip-loadInBackground.html)| Corresponding to the
"Load In Background" flag in the inspector, when this flag is set, the loading

[loadState](AudioClip-loadState.html)| Returns the current load state of the
audio data associated with an AudioClip.  
[loadType](AudioClip-loadType.html)| The load type of the clip (read-only).  
[preloadAudioData](AudioClip-preloadAudioData.html)| Preloads audio data of

[UnloadAudioData](AudioClip.UnloadAudioData.html)| Unloads the audio data
associated with the clip. This works only for AudioClips that are based on
