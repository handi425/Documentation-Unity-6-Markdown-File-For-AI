### Description

A set of bit flags describing [InputDevice](XR.InputDevice.html)
characteristics.

The XR system combines the **InputDeviceFlags** members into the
[InputDevice.characteristics](XR.InputDevice-characteristics.html) bitmask to
describe the characteristics and capabilities of an input device. You can also
pass a bitwise combination of flags from this enumeration to
[InputDevices.GetDevicesWithCharacteristics](XR.InputDevices.GetDevicesWithCharacteristics.html)
to get a list of devices with specific characteristics. For example, you could
use the following to get the right-hand controller:  
  
`(InputDeviceCharacteristics.HeldInHand | InputDeviceCharacteristics.Right)`.

### Properties

[None](XR.InputDeviceCharacteristics.None.html)| A default value specifying no
flags.  
---|---  
[HeadMounted](XR.InputDeviceCharacteristics.HeadMounted.html)| The InputDevice
is attached to the head.  
[Camera](XR.InputDeviceCharacteristics.Camera.html)| The InputDevice has a
camera and associated camera tracking information.  
[HeldInHand](XR.InputDeviceCharacteristics.HeldInHand.html)| The InputDevice
is held in the user's hand. Typically, a tracked controller.  
[HandTracking](XR.InputDeviceCharacteristics.HandTracking.html)| The
InputDevice provides hand tracking information via a Hand input feature.  
[EyeTracking](XR.InputDeviceCharacteristics.EyeTracking.html)| The InputDevice
provides eye tracking information via an Eyes input feature.  
[TrackedDevice](XR.InputDeviceCharacteristics.TrackedDevice.html)| The
InputDevice provides 3DOF or 6DOF tracking data.  
[Controller](XR.InputDeviceCharacteristics.Controller.html)| The InputDevice
is a game controller.  
[TrackingReference](XR.InputDeviceCharacteristics.TrackingReference.html)| The
InputDevice is an unmoving reference object used to locate and track other
objects in the world.  
[Left](XR.InputDeviceCharacteristics.Left.html)| The InputDevice is associated
with the left side of the user.  
[Right](XR.InputDeviceCharacteristics.Right.html)| The InputDevice is
associated with the right side of the user.
