### Description

`CreateGUI` is called when the EditorWindow's rootVisualElement is ready to be
populated.

Use `CreateGUI` to add UI Toolkit UI elements to your window.  
  
When creating a custom Editor window, follow these guidelines:

  * Put code dependent on UXML/USS loading in the [CreateGUI](EditorWindow.CreateGUI.html) method to ensure that all necessary assets are available.
  * Keep the event registration code inside [CreateGUI](EditorWindow.CreateGUI.html) or after [CreateGUI](EditorWindow.CreateGUI.html) is called.

It's important to note that `CreateGUI` might not be called before the first
call to [Update](EditorWindow.Update.html). For more information, refer to
[the order of execution of the Editor window](EditorWindow.html).  
  
For an example on how to create an Editor window to react to user input, refer
to [Create a custom Editor window with C# script](../Manual/UIE-HowTo-
CreateEditorWindow.html).

    
    
    // The window appears in front of the [Editor](Editor.html).
    // The window shows the type of a Unity object the cursor is over.
    
    using UnityEngine;
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);
    using UnityEngine.UIElements;
    
    public class MouseOverWindowExample : [EditorWindow](EditorWindow.html)
    {
        string mouseOver = "Nothing...";
        [Label](UIElements.Label.html) label;
    
        [[MenuItem](MenuItem.html)("Examples/Mouse Over Example")]
        static void Init()
        {
            GetWindow<MouseOverWindowExample>("mouseOver");
        }
    
        void CreateGUI()
        {
            label = new [Label](UIElements.Label.html)($"Mouse over: {mouseOver}");
            rootVisualElement.Add(label);
        }
    
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            label.schedule.Execute(() =>
            {
                mouseOver = [EditorWindow.mouseOverWindow](EditorWindow-mouseOverWindow.html) ?
                            EditorWindow.mouseOverWindow.ToString() : "Nothing...";
                label.text = $"Mouse over: {mouseOver}";
            }).Every(10);
        }
    }
