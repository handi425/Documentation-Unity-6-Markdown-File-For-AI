## Declaration

public static void DrawMeshInstancedProcedural([Mesh](Mesh.html) mesh, int
submeshIndex, [Material](Material.html) material, [Bounds](Bounds.html)
bounds, int count, [MaterialPropertyBlock](MaterialPropertyBlock.html)
properties, [Rendering.ShadowCastingMode](Rendering.ShadowCastingMode.html)
castShadows, bool receiveShadows, int layer, [Camera](Camera.html) camera,
[Rendering.LightProbeUsage](Rendering.LightProbeUsage.html) lightProbeUsage,
[LightProbeProxyVolume](LightProbeProxyVolume.html) lightProbeProxyVolume);

### Parameters

mesh | The [Mesh](Mesh.html) to draw.  
---|---  
submeshIndex | Which subset of the mesh to draw. This applies only to meshes that are composed of several materials.  
material |  [Material](Material.html) to use.  
bounds | The bounding volume surrounding the instances you intend to draw.  
count | The number of instances to be drawn.  
properties | Additional material properties to apply. See [MaterialPropertyBlock](MaterialPropertyBlock.html).  
castShadows | Determines whether the Meshes should cast shadows.  
receiveShadows | Determines whether the Meshes should receive shadows.  
layer |  [Layer](../Manual/Layers.html) to use.  
camera | If `null` (default), the mesh will be drawn in all cameras. Otherwise it will be drawn in the given Camera only.  
lightProbeUsage |  [LightProbeUsage](Rendering.LightProbeUsage.html) for the instances.  
  
### Description

This function is now obsolete. Use
[Graphics.RenderMeshPrimitives](Graphics.RenderMeshPrimitives.html) instead.
Draws the same mesh multiple times using GPU instancing. This is similar to
[Graphics.DrawMeshInstancedIndirect](Graphics.DrawMeshInstancedIndirect.html),
except that when the instance count is known from script, it can be supplied
directly using this method, rather than via a ComputeBuffer.

To render the instances with light probes, provide the light probe data via
the MaterialPropertyBlock and specify `lightProbeUsage` with
[LightProbeUsage.CustomProvided](Rendering.LightProbeUsage.CustomProvided.html).
Check
[LightProbes.CalculateInterpolatedLightAndOcclusionProbes](LightProbes.CalculateInterpolatedLightAndOcclusionProbes.html)
for the details. Additional resources:
[Graphics.RenderMeshPrimitives](Graphics.RenderMeshPrimitives.html).
