## Declaration

public uint GetFaceIndex(int i);

### Parameters

i | Index of the contact point.  
---|---  
  
### Returns

**uint** Index of a face this contact point belongs to.

### Description

Get the index of a face a particular contact point belongs to in this contact
pair. Use this with [Mesh.triangles](Mesh-triangles.html).

Only valid if one of the colliders in this pair is a non-convex MeshCollider.
In this case, that collider will always be the second shape of the pair. A
value of 0xffffFFFF indicates an error, which could be none of the Colliders
were non-convex MeshColliders, or that the contact point index was out of
bounds.
