public int Count;

### Description

Collected samples count.

Use to determine how many samples had been collected by the ProfilerRecorder.
Count is always >= 0 and <
[Capacity](Unity.Profiling.ProfilerRecorder.Capacity.html).  
  
**Note:** If recorder is created with
[ProfilerRecorderOptions.WrapAroundWhenCapacityReached](Unity.Profiling.ProfilerRecorderOptions.WrapAroundWhenCapacityReached.html)
the Count property determines the index of the next sample to be collected.
You can look at it as a running index in a round-robin sample buffer. This is
useful in use cases such as mapping data to the histogram texture.

Is something described here not working as you expect it to? It might be a
**Known Issue**. Please check with the Issue Tracker at
