## Declaration

public int GetInstanceID();

### Returns

**int** Returns the instance ID of the object.

### Description

Gets the instance ID of the object.

The instance ID of an object acts like a handle to the in-memory instance. It
is always unique, and never has the value 0. Objects loaded from file will be
assigned a positive Instance ID. Newly created objects will have a negative
Instance ID, and retain that negative value even if the object is later saved
to file. Therefore the sign of the InstanceID value is not a safe indicator
for whether or not the object is persistent.  
  
The ID changes between sessions of the player runtime and Editor. As such, the
ID is not reliable for performing actions that could span between sessions,
for example, loading an object state from a file.
