## Declaration

public void SetBufferCounterValue([ComputeBuffer](ComputeBuffer.html) buffer,
uint counterValue);

## Declaration

public void SetBufferCounterValue([GraphicsBuffer](GraphicsBuffer.html)
buffer, uint counterValue);

### Parameters

buffer | The destination buffer.  
---|---  
counterValue | Value of the append/consume counter.  
  
### Description

Adds a command to set the counter value of append/consume buffer.

Append/consume and counter buffers (see
[ComputeBufferType.Append](ComputeBufferType.Append.html),
[ComputeBufferType.Counter](ComputeBufferType.Counter.html)) keep track of the
number of elements in them with a special counter variable. SetCounterValue
explicitly sets the counter value.  
  
This can be used to reset the counter or to set it to a specific value.  
  
Note: SetCounterValue can not be called while the buffer is bound via
[CommandBuffer.SetRandomWriteTarget](Rendering.CommandBuffer.SetRandomWriteTarget.html).
