[Switch to Manual](../Manual/class-Mathf.html "Go to Mathf Component in the
Manual")

## Declaration

public static float Atan2(float y, float x);

### Description

Returns the angle in radians whose [Tan](Mathf.Tan.html) is `y/x`.

Return value is the angle between the x-axis and a 2D vector starting at zero
and terminating at (x,y).  
  
**Note:** This function takes account of the cases where x is zero and returns
the correct angle rather than throwing a division by zero exception.

    
    
    // Usually you use transform.LookAt for this.
    // But this can give you more control over the angle  
      
    using UnityEngine;
    using System.Collections;  
      
    public class ExampleClass : [MonoBehaviour](MonoBehaviour.html)
    {
        public [Transform](Transform.html) target;  
      
        void [Update](PlayerLoop.Update.html)()
        {
            [Vector3](Vector3.html) relative = transform.InverseTransformPoint(target.position);
            float angle = [Mathf.Atan2](Mathf.Atan2.html)(relative.x, relative.z) * [Mathf.Rad2Deg](Mathf.Rad2Deg.html);
            transform.Rotate(0, angle, 0);
        }
    }
