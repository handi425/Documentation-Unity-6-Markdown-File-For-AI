## Declaration

public static int OverlapCollider([Collider2D](Collider2D.html) collider,
List<Collider2D> results);

### Parameters

collider | The Collider that defines the area used to query for other Collider overlaps.  
---|---  
results | The list to receive results.  
  
### Returns

**int** Returns the number of results placed in the `results` list.

### Description

Gets a list of all Colliders that overlap the given `Collider`.

The integer return value is the number of results written into the `results`
list. The results list will be resized if it doesn't contain enough elements
to report all the results. This prevents memory from being allocated for
results when the `results` list does not need to be resized, and improves
garbage collection performance when the query is performed frequently.

## Declaration

public static int OverlapCollider([Collider2D](Collider2D.html) collider,
[ContactFilter2D](ContactFilter2D.html) contactFilter, List<Collider2D>
results);

### Parameters

collider | The Collider that defines the area used to query for other Collider overlaps.  
---|---  
contactFilter | The contact filter used to filter the results differently, such as by layer mask, Z depth. Note that normal angle is not used for overlap testing.  
results | The list to receive results.  
  
### Returns

**int** Returns the number of results placed in the `results` list.

### Description

Gets a list of all Colliders that overlap the given `Collider`.

list. The results list will be resized if it doesn't contain enough elements
to report all the results. This prevents memory from being allocated for
results when the `results` list does not need to be resized, and improves

## Declaration

public static int OverlapCollider([Collider2D](Collider2D.html) collider,
[ContactFilter2D](ContactFilter2D.html) contactFilter, Collider2D[] results);

### Parameters

collider | The Collider that defines the area used to query for other Collider overlaps.  
---|---  
contactFilter | The contact filter used to filter the results differently, such as by layer mask, Z depth. Note that normal angle is not used for overlap testing.  
results | The array to receive results. The size of the array determines the maximum number of results that can be returned.  
  
### Returns

**int** Returns the number of results placed in the `results` array.

### Description

Gets a list of all Colliders that overlap the given `Collider`.

The integer return value is the number of Colliders that overlap the
`Collider` and which could be stored in the supplied array given its length.
The results array will not be resized if it doesn't contain enough elements to
report all the results. The significance of this is that no memory is
allocated for the results and so garbage collection performance is improved
when the check is performed frequently.
