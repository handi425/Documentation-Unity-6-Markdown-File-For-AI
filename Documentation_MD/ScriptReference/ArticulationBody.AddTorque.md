ArticulationBody Component in the Manual")

## Declaration

public void AddTorque([Vector3](Vector3.html) torque,
[ForceMode](ForceMode.html) mode = ForceMode.Force);

### Parameters

torque | The torque to apply.  
---|---  
mode | The type of torque to apply.  
  
### Description

Add torque to the articulation body.

You can only apply a torque to an active ArticulationBody. If a GameObject is
inactive, AddTorque has no effect.  
  
[ForceMode.Force](ForceMode.Force.html) and
[ForceMode.Acceleration](ForceMode.Acceleration.html) modes modify the Angular
Velocity Per Second accumulator and
[ForceMode.Impulse](ForceMode.Impulse.html) and
[ForceMode.VelocityChange](ForceMode.VelocityChange.html) modify the Angular
Velocity Per Step accumulator. Mixing these 2 groups of ForceModes doesn't
work for Articulation Bodies and will result in only the Angular Velocity Per
Second accumulator being applied.  
  
For more information on how ForceMode affects angular velocity, see
[Rigidbody.AddTorque](Rigidbody.AddTorque.html).  
  
Applying a torque to an ArticulationBody wakes up that body. If the torque
size is zero then the ArticulationBody does not wake up.  
Unit of measurement - Nm (Newtonmeters).

            ab = GetComponent<[ArticulationBody](ArticulationBody.html)>();
        }  
      
        void [FixedUpdate](PlayerLoop.FixedUpdate.html)()
        {
            float turn = [Input.GetAxis](Input.GetAxis.html)("Horizontal");
            ab.AddTorque(transform.up * torque * turn);
        }
    }
