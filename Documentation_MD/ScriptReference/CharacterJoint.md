### Description

Character Joints are mainly used for Ragdoll effects.

They are an extended ball-socket joint which allows you to limit the joint on
each axis.

### Properties

[enableProjection](CharacterJoint-enableProjection.html)| Brings violated
constraints back into alignment even when the solver fails.  
---|---  
[highTwistLimit](CharacterJoint-highTwistLimit.html)| The upper limit around
the primary axis of the character joint.  
[lowTwistLimit](CharacterJoint-lowTwistLimit.html)| The lower limit around the
primary axis of the character joint.  
[projectionAngle](CharacterJoint-projectionAngle.html)| Set the angular
tolerance threshold (in degrees) for projection.  
[projectionDistance](CharacterJoint-projectionDistance.html)| Set the linear
tolerance threshold for projection.  
[swing1Limit](CharacterJoint-swing1Limit.html)| The angular limit of rotation
(in degrees) around the primary axis of the character joint.  
[swing2Limit](CharacterJoint-swing2Limit.html)| The angular limit of rotation
(in degrees) around the primary axis of the character joint.  
[swingAxis](CharacterJoint-swingAxis.html)| The secondary axis around which
the joint can rotate.  
[swingLimitSpring](CharacterJoint-swingLimitSpring.html)| The configuration of
the spring attached to the swing limits of the joint.  
[twistLimitSpring](CharacterJoint-twistLimitSpring.html)| The configuration of
the spring attached to the twist limits of the joint.  
  
### Inherited Members

### Properties

[gameObject](Component-gameObject.html)| The game object this component is
attached to. A component is always attached to a game object.  
---|---  
[tag](Component-tag.html)| The tag of this game object.  
[transform](Component-transform.html)| The Transform attached to this
GameObject.  
[anchor](Joint-anchor.html)| The Position of the anchor around which the
joints motion is constrained.  
[autoConfigureConnectedAnchor](Joint-autoConfigureConnectedAnchor.html)|
Should the connectedAnchor be calculated automatically?  
[axis](Joint-axis.html)| The Direction of the axis around which the body is
constrained.  
[breakForce](Joint-breakForce.html)| The force that needs to be applied for
this joint to break.  
[breakTorque](Joint-breakTorque.html)| The torque that needs to be applied for
this joint to break. To be able to break, a joint must be _Locked_ or
_Limited_ on the axis of rotation where the torque is being applied. This
means that some joints cannot break, such as an unconstrained Configurable
Joint.  
[connectedAnchor](Joint-connectedAnchor.html)| Position of the anchor relative
to the connected Rigidbody.  
[connectedArticulationBody](Joint-connectedArticulationBody.html)| A reference
to an articulation body this joint connects to.  
[connectedBody](Joint-connectedBody.html)| A reference to another rigidbody
this joint connects to.  
[connectedMassScale](Joint-connectedMassScale.html)| The scale to apply to the
inverse mass and inertia tensor of the connected body prior to solving the
constraints.  
[currentForce](Joint-currentForce.html)| The force applied by the solver to
satisfy all constraints.  
[currentTorque](Joint-currentTorque.html)| The torque applied by the solver to
satisfy all constraints.  
[enableCollision](Joint-enableCollision.html)| Enable collision between bodies
connected with the joint.  
[enablePreprocessing](Joint-enablePreprocessing.html)| Toggle preprocessing
for this joint.  
[massScale](Joint-massScale.html)| The scale to apply to the inverse mass and
inertia tensor of the body prior to solving the constraints.  
[hideFlags](Object-hideFlags.html)| Should the object be hidden, saved with
the Scene or modifiable by the user?  
[name](Object-name.html)| The name of the object.  
  
### Public Methods

[BroadcastMessage](Component.BroadcastMessage.html)| Calls the method named
methodName on every MonoBehaviour in this game object or any of its children.  
---|---  
[CompareTag](Component.CompareTag.html)| Checks the GameObject's tag against
the defined tag.  
[GetComponent](Component.GetComponent.html)| Gets a reference to a component
of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified.  
[GetComponentInChildren](Component.GetComponentInChildren.html)| Gets a
reference to a component of type T on the same GameObject as the component
specified, or any child of the GameObject.  
[GetComponentIndex](Component.GetComponentIndex.html)| Gets the index of the
component on its parent GameObject.  
[GetComponentInParent](Component.GetComponentInParent.html)| Gets a reference
to a component of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified, or
any parent of the GameObject.  
[GetComponents](Component.GetComponents.html)| Gets references to all
components of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified.  
[GetComponentsInChildren](Component.GetComponentsInChildren.html)| Gets
references to all components of type T on the same GameObject as the component
specified, and any child of the GameObject.  
[GetComponentsInParent](Component.GetComponentsInParent.html)| Gets references
to all components of type T on the same GameObject as the component specified,
and any parent of the GameObject.  
[SendMessage](Component.SendMessage.html)| Calls the method named methodName
on every MonoBehaviour in this game object.  
[SendMessageUpwards](Component.SendMessageUpwards.html)| Calls the method
named methodName on every MonoBehaviour in this game object and on every
ancestor of the behaviour.  
[TryGetComponent](Component.TryGetComponent.html)| Gets the component of the
specified type, if it exists.  
[GetInstanceID](Object.GetInstanceID.html)| Gets the instance ID of the
object.  
[ToString](Object.ToString.html)| Returns the name of the object.  
  
### Static Methods

[Destroy](Object.Destroy.html)| Removes a GameObject, component or asset.  
---|---  
[DestroyImmediate](Object.DestroyImmediate.html)| Destroys the object obj
immediately. You are strongly recommended to use Destroy instead.  
[DontDestroyOnLoad](Object.DontDestroyOnLoad.html)| Do not destroy the target
Object when loading a new Scene.  
[FindAnyObjectByType](Object.FindAnyObjectByType.html)| Retrieves any active
loaded object of Type type.  
[FindFirstObjectByType](Object.FindFirstObjectByType.html)| Retrieves the
first active loaded object of Type type.  
[FindObjectsByType](Object.FindObjectsByType.html)| Retrieves a list of all
loaded objects of Type type.  
[Instantiate](Object.Instantiate.html)| Clones the object original and returns
the clone.  
[InstantiateAsync](Object.InstantiateAsync.html)| Captures a snapshot of the
original object (that must be related to some GameObject) and returns the
AsyncInstantiateOperation.  
  
### Operators

[bool](Object-operator_Object.html)| Does the object exist?  
---|---  
[operator !=](Object-operator_ne.html)| Compares if two objects refer to a
different object.  
[operator ==](Object-operator_eq.html)| Compares two object references to see
if they refer to the same object.
