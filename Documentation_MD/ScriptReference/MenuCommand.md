### Description

Used to extract the context for a [MenuItem](MenuItem.html).

[MenuCommand](MenuCommand.html) objects are passed to custom menu item
functions defined using the [MenuItem](MenuItem.html) attribute.  
  
**Note:** The menu is added to the object and is accessible by right-clicking
in the inspector. The script code requires the CONTEXT option.

    
    
    // Add context menu named "Do Something" to context menu
    using UnityEngine;
    using [UnityEditor](UnityEditor.html);  
      
    public class Something : [EditorWindow](EditorWindow.html)
    {
        // Add menu item
        [[MenuItem](MenuItem.html)("CONTEXT/[Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html)/Do Something")]
        static void DoSomething([MenuCommand](MenuCommand.html) command)
        {
            [Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html) body = ([Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html))command.context;
            body.mass = 5;
            [Debug.Log](Debug.Log.html)("Changed [Rigidbody](Rigidbody.html)'s Mass to " + body.mass + " from Context [Menu](Menu.html)...");
        }
    }
