More info See in Glossary 2D is used to adjust the friction and bounce that occur between 2D physics objects when they collide. For more detailed information on game physics, see 3D Physics . Use a Physics Material 2D To create a Physics Material 2D, go to Assets > Create > 2D > Physics Material 2D . Property Function Friction Set the coefficient of friction for this collider An invisible shape that is used to handle physical collisions for an object. A collider doesn’t need to be",
    "exactly the same shape as the object’s mesh - a rough approximation is often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay. More info See in Glossary . Bounciness Set the degree to which collisions A collision occurs when the physics engine detects that the colliders of two GameObjects make contact or overlap, when at least one has a Rigidbody component and is in motion. More info See in Glossary rebound from the surface. A value of 0 indicates no bounce while a value of 1 indicates a perfect bounce with no loss of energy. To use your created Physics Material 2D Use to adjust the friction and bounce that occurs between 2D physics objects when they collide More info See in Glossary , drag it onto an object with an attached 2D Collider component or drag it onto the collider in the Inspector A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values.
