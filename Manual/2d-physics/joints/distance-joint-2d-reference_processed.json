More info See in Glossary 2D is a 2D joint that attaches two GameObjects The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. More info See in Glossary controlled by Rigidbody A component that allows a GameObject to be affected by simulated gravity and",
    "other forces. More info See in Glossary 2D physics, and keeps them a certain distance apart. Properties Property Function Enable Collision A collision occurs when the physics engine detects that the colliders of two GameObjects make contact or overlap, when at least one has a Rigidbody component and is in motion. More info See in Glossary Enable this property to enable collisions between the two connected GameObjects. Connected Rigidbody Specify the other object this joint connects to. Leave this as None to have the other end of the joint fixed at a point in space defined by the Connected Anchor property. Select the circle icon to the right to view a list of GameObjects to connect to. Auto Configure Connected Anchor Enable this property to automatically set the anchor location for the other object this joint connects to. You do not need to enter coordinates for the Connected Anchor property if you enable this property. Anchor Define where (in terms of x, y-coordinates on the Rigidbody",
    "2D ) the end point of the joint connects to this GameObject. Connected Anchor Define where (in terms of x, y-coordinates on the Rigidbody 2D ) the end point of the joint connects to the other GameObject. Auto Configure Distance Enable this to automatically detect the current distance between the two GameObjects, and set it as the distance that the Distance Joint 2D keeps between the two GameObjects. When enabled, you do not need to specify the distance between the GameObjects at Distance . Distance Specify the distance that the Distance Joint 2D keeps between the two GameObjects. Max Distance Only Enable this to only enforce a maximum distance. This allows connected GameObjects to move closer to each other, but not further than the distance set by Distance . Clear this to keep the distance between the GameObjects fixed. Break Action Set the action taken when either a force or torque threshold is exceeded. Break Force Set the force threshold which if exceeded, will cause the joint to",
    "perform the selected Break Action . The default value is set to Infinity , which can never be exceeded and therefore the Break Action can never be taken while the threshold remains at this value.
