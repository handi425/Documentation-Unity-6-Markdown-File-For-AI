More info See in Glossary 2D to connect two GameObjects The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. More info See in Glossary controlled by Rigidbody A component that allows a GameObject to be affected by simulated gravity and other forces. More info See",
    "in Glossary 2D physics to keep them in a position relative to each other, so the GameObjects are always offset at a given position and angle. It is a spring-type 2D joint for which you don’t need to set maximum forces. You can set the spring to be rigid or soft. Refer to Fixed Joint 2D and Relative Joint 2D for the differences between Fixed Joint A joint type that is completely constrained, allowing two objects to be held together. Implemented as a spring so some motion may still occur. More info See in Glossary 2D and Relative Joint 2D A 2D joint that allows two game objects controlled by Rigidbody physics to maintain in a position based on each other’s location. Use this joint to keep two objects offset from each other, at a position and angle you decide More info See in Glossary . Properties Property Function Enable Collision A collision occurs when the physics engine detects that the colliders of two GameObjects make contact or overlap, when at least one has a Rigidbody component",
    "and is in motion. More info See in Glossary Enable this property to enable collisions between the two connected GameObjects. Connected Rigid Body Specify the other object this joint connects to. Leave this as None to have the other end of the joint fixed at a point in space defined by the Connected Anchor property. Select the circle icon to the right to view a list of GameObjects to connect to. Auto Configure Connected Anchor Enable this property to automatically set the anchor location for the other object this joint connects to. You do not need to enter coordinates for the Connected Anchor property if you enable this property. Anchor Define where (in terms of x, y-coordinates on the Rigidbody 2D ) the end point of the joint connects to this GameObject. Connected Anchor Define where (in terms of x, y-coordinates on the Rigidbody 2D ) the end point of the joint connects to the other GameObject. Damping Ratio A joint setting to control spring oscillation. A higher damping ratio means the",
    "spring will come to rest faster. More info See in Glossary Set the degree to suppress spring oscillation. In the range 0 to 1, the higher the value, the less movement. Frequency Set the frequency at which the spring oscillates while the GameObjects are approaching the separation distance you want (measured in cycles per second). In the range 0 to 1,000,000 - the higher the value, the stiffer the spring. Note: Setting Frequency to zero will create the stiffest spring type joint possible. Break Action Set the action taken when either the force or torque threshold is exceeded. Break Force Set the force threshold which if exceeded, will cause the joint to perform the selected Break Action . The default value is set to Infinity , which can never be exceeded and therefore the Break Action can never be taken while the threshold remains at this value. Break Torque Set the torque threshold which if exceeded, will cause the joint to perform the selected Break Action . The default value is set to",
