More info See in Glossary to connect a Rigidbody A component that allows a GameObject to be affected by simulated gravity and other forces. More info See in Glossary GameObject The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. More info See in Glossary to a point in space. The aim of this joint",
    "is to keep zero linear distance between two points: An anchor point on a Rigidbody object and a world space position, called the “ Target ”. The joint applies linear force to the Rigidbody object, it does not apply torque (angular force). The joint uses a simulated spring. You can set the spring’s stiffness and movement by adjusting its settings. For example, to set a stiff and barely moving spring: Set a high (1,000,000 is the highest) Frequency == a stiff spring. Set a high (1 is the highest) Damping Ratio A joint setting to control spring oscillation. A higher damping ratio means the spring will come to rest faster. More info See in Glossary == a barely moving spring. To simulate a looser and more freely moving spring, you would use the following settings: Set a low Frequency == a loose spring. Set a low Damping Ratio == a moving spring. When the spring applies its force between the Rigidbody object and target, it tends to overshoot the distance you have set between them, and then",
    "rebound repeatedly, giving in a continuous oscillation. The Damping Ratio sets how quickly the Rigidbody object stops moving. The Frequency sets how quickly the Rigidbody object oscillates either side of the distance you have specified. This joint has one constraint: Maintain a zero linear distance between the anchor point on a Rigidbody object and a world space position ( Target ). You can use this joint to construct physical objects that need to move to designated target positions and stay there until another target position A joint property to set the target position that the joint’s drive force should move it to. More info See in Glossary is selected or the target is cleared. For example: A game where players pick up cakes, using a mouse-click, and drag them into to a plate. You can use this joint to move each cake to the plate. You could also use the joint to allow objects to hang: If the anchor point is not the center of mass Represents the average position of all mass in a",
    "Rigidbody for the purposes of physics calculations. By default it is computed from all colliders belonging to the Rigidbody, but can be modified via script. More info See in Glossary , then the object will rotate. Such as: A game where players pick up boxes. If they use a mouse-click to pick a box up by its corner and drag it, it will hang from the cursor.
