More info See in Glossary physics components, and are made to work only with 2D GameObjects. You can only attach 2D joints to GameObjects which have an attached Rigidbody A component that allows a GameObject to be affected by simulated gravity and other forces. More info See in Glossary 2D component, or to a fixed position in world space. A 2D joint connects a Rigidbody 2D GameObject The fundamental object in Unity scenes,",
    "which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. More info See in Glossary to another Rigidbody 2D GameObject. 2D joints can apply forces that move Rigidbody GameObjects, and joint limits can restrict that movement. You can tell a 2D joint from its 3D counterpart in the Component browser by its name ending in ‘2D’. There are many different types of 2D joints available. Refer to each joint’s respective page for detailed information about their properties and uses. These can be found in the 2D Joints section. 2D joints 2D joint constraints Copyright ©2005-2025 Unity Technologies. All rights reserved. Built from 6000.0.36f1 (02b661dc617c). Built on: 2025-01-14.
