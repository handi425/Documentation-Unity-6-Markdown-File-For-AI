More info See in Glossary 2D to simulate a rolling wheel, on which an object can move. You can apply motor power to the joint. The wheel uses a suspension spring to maintain its distance from the main body of the vehicle. Properties Property Function Enable Collision A collision occurs when the physics engine detects that the colliders of two GameObjects make contact or overlap, when at least one has a Rigidbody component and is in motion. More info See in",
    "Glossary Enable this property to enable collisions between the two connected GameObjects The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. More info See in Glossary . Connected Rigid Body Specify the other GameObject this joint connects to. If you leave this as None , the other end of the joint is fixed to a point in space defined by the Connected Anchor setting. Select the circle icon to the right to view a list of GameObjects to connect to. Auto Configure Connected Anchor Enable this property to automatically set the anchor location for the other GameObject this Hinge Joint A joint that groups together two Rigidbody components, constraining them to move like they are connected by a hinge. It is perfect for doors, but can also be used to model chains, pendulums and so on. More info See in Glossary 2D connects to. You do not need to enter",
    "coordinates for the Connected Anchor property if you enable this property. Anchor Define where (in terms of x, y-coordinates on the Rigidbody 2D ) the end point of the joint connects to this GameObject. Connected Anchor Define where (in terms of x, y-coordinates on the Rigidbody 2D ) the end point of the joint connects to the other GameObject. Suspension Select this to expand this property’s settings. Damping Ratio A joint setting to control spring oscillation. A higher damping ratio means the spring will come to rest faster. More info See in Glossary Set the degree to suppress spring oscillation. In the range 0 to 1, the higher the value, the less movement. Frequency Set the frequency at which the spring oscillates while the GameObjects are approaching the separation distance you want (measured in cycles per second). In the range 0 to 1,000,000 - the higher the value, the stiffer the spring. Note: Setting Frequency to zero will create the stiffest spring type joint possible. Angle Set",
    "the world movement angle for the suspension. Use Motor Enable this to apply motor force to the joint. Motor Select this to expand this property’s settings. Motor Speed Target speed (degrees per second) for the motor to reach. Maximum Motor Force Set the maximum torque (or rotation) the motor can apply when attempting to reach the target speed. Break Action Set the action taken when either the force or torque threshold is exceeded. Break Force Set the force threshold which if exceeded, will cause the joint to perform the selected Break Action . The default value is set to Infinity , which can never be exceeded and therefore the Break Action can never be taken while the threshold remains at this value. Break Torque Set the torque threshold which if exceeded, will cause the joint to perform the selected Break Action . The default value is set to Infinity , which can never be exceeded and therefore the Break Action can never be taken while the threshold remains at this value. Wheel Joint 2D",
