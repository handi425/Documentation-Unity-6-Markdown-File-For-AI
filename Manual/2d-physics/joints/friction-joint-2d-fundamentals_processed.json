More info See in Glossary 2D to slow down movement between two points to a stop. This joint’s aim is to maintain a zero relative linear and angular offset between two points. Those two points can be two Rigidbody A component that allows a GameObject to be affected by simulated gravity and other forces.

    "world. (Connect to a fixed position in the world by setting Connected Rigidbody to None). Resistance The joint applies linear force ( Force ) and angle force ( Torque ) to both Rigidbody 2D points. It uses a simulated motor that is pre-configured to have a low motor power (and so, low resistance). You can change the resistance to make it weaker or stronger. Strong Resistance: A high (1,000,000 is the highest) Max Force creates strong linear resistance. The Rigidbody 2D GameObjects The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. More info See in Glossary won’t move in a line relative to each other very much. A high (1,000,000 is the highest) Max Torque creates strong angular resistance. The Rigidbody 2D GameObjects won’t move at an angle relative to each other very much. Weak Resistance: A low Max Force creates weak linear resistance. The",
    "Rigidbody 2D GameObjects move easily in a line relative to each other. A low Max Torque creates weak angular resistance. The Rigidbody 2D GameObjects move easily at an angle relative to each other. Constraints Friction Joint 2D has two simultaneous constraints: Maintain a zero relative linear velocity between two anchor points on two Rigidbody 2Ds Maintain a zero relative angular velocity between two anchor points on two Rigidbody 2Ds You can use this joint to construct physical GameObjects that need to behave as if they have friction. They can resist either linear movement or angular movement, or both linear and angular movement. For example: A platform that does rotate, but resists applied forces, making it difficult but possible for the player to move it. A ball that resists linear movement. The ball’s friction is related to the GameObject’s velocity and not to any collisions A collision occurs when the physics engine detects that the colliders of two GameObjects make contact or",
    "overlap, when at least one has a Rigidbody component and is in motion. More info See in Glossary . It acts like the Linear Drag and Angular Drag which is set in Rigidbody 2D . The difference is that Friction Joint 2D has the option of maximum Force and Torque settings.
