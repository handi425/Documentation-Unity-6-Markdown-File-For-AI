Can be Dynamic (the body moves under simulation and is affected by forces like gravity), Kinematic (the body moves under simulation, but and isn’t affected by forces like gravity) or Static (the body doesn’t move under simulation). More info See in Glossary Rigidbody A component that allows a GameObject to be affected by simulated gravity and other forces. More info See in Glossary 2D is designed to move under simulation, but only under very explicit user",
    "control. While a Dynamic Rigidbody 2D is affected by gravity and forces, a Kinematic Rigidbody 2D is not. Because of this, the Kinematic Rigidbody 2D has a lower demand on system resources than a Dynamic Rigidbody 2D, allowing it to be simulated faster. To reposition a Kinematic Rigidbody 2D, it must be repositioned explicitly via Rigidbody2D.MovePosition or Rigidbody2D.MoveRotation . Use physics queries to detect collisions A collision occurs when the physics engine detects that the colliders of two GameObjects make contact or overlap, when at least one has a Rigidbody component and is in motion. More info See in Glossary , and scripts A piece of code that allows you to create your own Components, trigger game events, modify Component properties over time and respond to user input in any way you like. More info See in Glossary to decide where and how the Rigidbody 2D should move. A Kinematic Rigidbody 2D can still move via its velocity, but the velocity is not affected by forces or",
    "gravity. A Kinematic Rigidbody 2D does not collide with other Kinematic Rigidbody 2Ds or with Static Rigidbody 2Ds and will only collide with Dynamic Rigidbody 2Ds.
