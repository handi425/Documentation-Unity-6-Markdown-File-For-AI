More info See in Glossary . Kinematic Rigidbody 2D properties Property Function Body Type Select to set the movement behavior and Collider An invisible shape that is used to handle physical collisions for an object. A collider doesn’t need to be exactly the same shape as the object’s mesh - a rough approximation is often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay. More info See in Glossary 2D interaction of this Rigidbody 2D’s component settings. Dynamic Select to set this Rigidbody 2D to the Dynamic Body Type, which is designed to move under simulation and has all Rigidbody 2D properties available. This is the default Body Type for a Rigidbody 2D. Kinematic Select to set this Rigidbody 2D to the Kinematic Body Type, which is designed to move under",
    "simulation but only under very explicit user control. Static Select to set this Rigidbody 2D to the Static Body Type, which is designed to not move under simulation at all and behaves like an immovable object with infinite mass. Refer to Body Type: Static for more information. Material Set a common physics material A physics asset for adjusting the friction and bouncing effects of colliding objects. More info See in Glossary for all Collider 2Ds attached to this Rigidbody 2D. Note: A Collider 2D uses its own Material property if it has one set. If there is no Material specified here or in the Collider 2D, the default option is None (Physics Material 2D) . This uses a default Material which you can set in the Physics 2D window. Simulated Enable Simulated to have the Rigidbody 2D and any attached Collider 2Ds and Joint A physics component allowing a dynamic connection between Rigidbody components, usually allowing some degree of movement such as a hinge. More info See in Glossary 2Ds to",
    "interact with the physics simulation during runtime. If this is disabled, these components do not interact with the simulation. Refer to Rigidbody 2D properties: Simulated , below for more information. This property is enabled by default. Full Kinematic Contact Enable this property if you want the Rigidbody 2D to be able to collide with all other Rigidbody 2D Body Types . Note : When this property is disabled, the Kinematic Rigidbody 2D only collides with Dynamic Rigidbody 2Ds. See Using Full Kinematic Contacts for more details. Collision Detection An automatic process performed by Unity which determines whether a moving GameObject with a Rigidbody and collider component has come into contact with any other colliders. More info See in Glossary Define how collisions between Collider 2Ds are detected. Discrete Select this option to allow GameObjects The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s",
    "functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. More info See in Glossary with Rigidbody 2Ds and Collider 2Ds to overlap or pass through each other during a physics update, if they are moving fast enough. Collision contacts are only generated at the new position. Continuous Select this option to ensure GameObjects with Rigidbody 2Ds and Collider 2Ds do not pass through each other during a physics update. Instead, Unity calculates the first impact point of any of the Collider 2Ds, and moves the GameObject there. Note: This option takes more CPU time than Discrete . Sleeping Mode Define how the GameObject “sleeps” to save processor time when it is at rest. Never Sleep Select this option to have sleeping disabled. Important: This should be avoided where possible, as it can impact system resources. Start Awake Select this to have the GameObject initially awake. Start Asleep Select this to have the GameObject initially asleep but can be awaken by collisions. Interpolate Define how",
    "the GameObject’s movement is interpolated between physics updates. Note : This is useful when motion tends to be jerky. None Select this to not apply movement smoothing. Interpolate Select this to smoothen movement based on the GameObject’s positions in previous frames. Extrapolate Select this to smoothen movement is smoothed based on an estimate of its position in the next frame. Constraints Define any restrictions on the Rigidbody 2D’s motion. Freeze Position Stops the Rigidbody 2D moving in the X and Y world axes selectively. Freeze Rotation Stops the Rigidbody 2D rotating around the Z world axis selectively. Layer Overrides Expand for the Layer override settings. Include Layers Select the additional Layers that all Collider 2Ds attached to this Rigidbody 2D should include, when deciding if a collision with another Collider2D should occur or not. Refer to Rigidbody2D-includeLayers for more information. Exclude Layers Select the additional Layers that all Collider 2Ds attached to this",
    "Rigidbody 2D should exclude, when deciding if a collision with another Collider 2D should occur or not. Refer to Rigidbody2D-excludeLayers for more information. Full Kinematic Contacts Enabling Full Kinematic Contacts enables a Kinematic Rigidbody 2D to collide with all Rigidbody 2D Body Types . This is similar to the behavior of a Dynamic Rigidbody 2D, except the Kinematic Rigidbody 2D is not moved by the physics system when contacting another Rigidbody 2D. Instead, it behaves like an immovable object with infinite mass. When this property is disabled, a Kinematic Rigidbody 2D will only collide with Dynamic Rigidbody 2Ds and not the other Body Types . Note : Trigger Colliders are an exception to this rule. This means that no collision scripting callbacks ( OnCollisionEnter , OnCollisionStay , OnCollisionExit ) will occur. This can be inconvenient when you are using physics queries (such as Physics.Raycast ) to detect where and how a Rigidbody 2D should move, and when you require",
    "multiple Kinematic Rigidbody 2Ds to interact with each other. Enable Use Full Kinematic Contacts to make Kinematic Rigidbody 2D components interact in this way. Note : Use Full Kinematic Contacts allows explicit position and rotation control of a Kinematic Rigidbody 2D, but still allows full collision callbacks. In a setup where you need explicit control of all Rigidbody 2Ds, use Kinematic Rigidbody 2Ds in place of Dynamic Rigidbody 2Ds to still have full collision callback support.
