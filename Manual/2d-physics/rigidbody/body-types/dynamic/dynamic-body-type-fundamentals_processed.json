Can be Dynamic (the body moves under simulation and is affected by forces like gravity), Kinematic (the body moves under simulation, but and isn’t affected by forces like gravity) or Static (the body doesn’t move under simulation). More info See in Glossary is the default Body Type for a Rigidbody A component that allows a GameObject to be affected by simulated gravity and other forces.

    "move and is designed to move under simulation. All Rigidbody 2D properties are available with this Body Type, such as finite mass and drag, and is affected by gravity and forces. A Dynamic body will collide with every other Body Type, and is the most interactive of Body Types. It’s also the most performance-expensive Body Type, because of its dynamic nature and interactivity with everything around it.
