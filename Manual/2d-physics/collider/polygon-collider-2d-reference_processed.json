A collider doesn’t need to be exactly the same shape as the object’s mesh - a rough approximation is often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay. More info See in Glossary 2D component is a Collider 2D that interacts with the 2D physics system. This collider 2D’s shape is a freeform edge of line segments that you can adjust to fit the shape of a sprite A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are",
    "essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during development. More info See in Glossary or any other shape. Note: The edge must completely enclose an area for the collider to work. Property Function Edit Collider Select this to edit the collider’s geometry by editing and moving its vertices. Material Select the Physics Material 2D Use to adjust the friction and bounce that occurs between 2D physics objects when they collide More info See in Glossary that determines properties of collisions A collision occurs when the physics engine detects that the colliders of two GameObjects make contact or overlap, when at least one has a Rigidbody component and is in motion. More info See in Glossary , such as friction and bounce. Is Trigger Enable this if you want this Collider 2D to behave as a trigger. The physics system ignores this collider when this is enabled. Used by Effector Enable this if",
    "you want an attached Effector 2D to use the Collider 2D. Auto Tiling Enable this if the Sprite Renderer A component that lets you display images as Sprites for use in both 2D and 3D scenes. More info See in Glossary component for the selected sprite has its Draw Mode set to Tiled . This enables automatic updates to the shape of the Collider 2D , allowing the shape to automatically readjust when the Sprite’s dimensions change. If you don’t enable Auto Tiling , the Collider 2D geometry doesn’t automatically repeat. Composite Operations Select the composite operation used by an attached Composite Collider 2D component. Note: When you select any operation besides None , the following properties— Material , Is Trigger , Used By Effector , and Edge Radius —become controlled by the attached Composite Collider 2D component and are no longer available in this collider’s properties. None Select this to have no composite operation take place. Merge Select this to have this composite operation",
    "compose geometry using a Boolean OR operation. Intersect Select this to have this composite operation compose geometry using a Boolean AND operation. Difference Select this to have this composite operation compose geometry using a Boolean NOT operation. Flip Select this to have this composite operation compose geometry using a Boolean XOR operation. Offset Set the local offset values of the Collider 2D geometry. Use Delaunay Mesh The main graphics primitive of Unity. Meshes make up a large part of your 3D worlds. Unity supports triangulated or Quadrangulated polygon meshes. Nurbs, Nurms, Subdiv surfaces must be converted to polygons. More info See in Glossary Enable this property to include an additional Delaunay triangulation step to produce the collider mesh.
