A collider doesn’t need to be exactly the same shape as the object’s mesh - a rough approximation is often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay. More info See in Glossary 2D is a Collider 2D that interacts with the 2D physics system. Unlike other colliders, you don’t configure this collider in the Unity Editor, instead you configure the collider by assigning PhysicsShape2D geometry to it via the PhysicsShapeGroup2D API. You can",
    "define the collider’s shape by adding, removing, and modifying the PhysicsShape2D shapes. Refer to the PhysicsShape2D API documentation for more information. This also means that a Custom Collider 2D can contain an unlimited number of low-level PhysicsShape2D and form any shape, or emulate other types of Collider 2D. Property Function Material Select the Physics Material 2D Use to adjust the friction and bounce that occurs between 2D physics objects when they collide More info See in Glossary that determines properties of collisions A collision occurs when the physics engine detects that the colliders of two GameObjects make contact or overlap, when at least one has a Rigidbody component and is in motion. More info See in Glossary , such as friction and bounce. Is Trigger Enable this if you want this Collider 2D to behave as a trigger. The physics system ignores this Collider when this is enabled. Used by Effector Enable this if you want the Collider 2D to be used by an attached",
    "Effector 2D. Offset Set the local offset values of the Collider 2D geometry. Custom Shape Count (Read only) Indicates how many PhysicsShape2D the Collider is using. Custom Vertex Count (Read Only) Indicates how many vertices all PhysicsShape2D in the Collider are using. Layer Overrides Expand for the Layer override settings. Layer Override Priority Assign the decision priority that this Collider2D uses when resolving conflicting decisions on whether a contact between itself and another Collision2D should happen or not.
