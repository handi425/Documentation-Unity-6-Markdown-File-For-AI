A collider doesn’t need to be exactly the same shape as the object’s mesh - a rough approximation is often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay. More info See in Glossary 2D component to a GameObject The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. More info See in Glossary , the collider 2D defines which area of the GameObject has collision A collision occurs when the",
    "physics engine detects that the colliders of two GameObjects make contact or overlap, when at least one has a Rigidbody component and is in motion. More info See in Glossary and can interact with other colliders in the scene A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. More info See in Glossary . The collider 2D is invisible, and it’s shape is about the same shape as the GameObject for more accurate collisions. You can adjust a collider’s shape and other properties in its Inspector A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. More info See in Glossary window properties. Colliders for 2D GameObjects all have names ending with 2D. You can’t use 3D GameObjects with 2D colliders, or 2D",
