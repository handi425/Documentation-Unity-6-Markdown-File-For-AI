A collider doesn’t need to be exactly the same shape as the object’s mesh - a rough approximation is often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay. More info See in Glossary 2D component is a Collider 2D that interacts with the 2D physics system for collision A collision occurs when the physics engine detects that the colliders of two GameObjects make contact or overlap, when at least one has a Rigidbody component and is in motion. More info See in",
    "Glossary detection. This collider 2D is circular in shape, with a defined position and radius within the local coordinate space of a sprite A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during development. More info See in Glossary . Adjust the component properties to change the shape and behavior of the collider 2D. Property Function Material Select the Physics Material 2D Use to adjust the friction and bounce that occurs between 2D physics objects when they collide More info See in Glossary that determines properties of collisions, such as friction and bounce. Is Trigger Enable this option if you want the Collider 2D to behave as a trigger. The physics system ignores the Collider 2D when you enable this option. Used by Effector Enable this option if you want an attached Effector 2D to use this Collider 2D. Composite",
    "Operations Select the composite operation used by an attached Composite Collider 2D component. Note: When you select any operation besides None , the following properties— Material , Is Trigger , Used By Effector , and Edge Radius —become controlled by the attached Composite Collider 2D component and are no longer available in this collider’s properties. None Select this to have no composite operation take place. Merge Select this to have this composite operation compose geometry using a Boolean OR operation. Intersect Select this to have this composite operation compose geometry using a Boolean AND operation. Difference Select this to have this composite operation compose geometry using a Boolean NOT operation. Flip Select this to have this composite operation compose geometry using a Boolean XOR operation. Offset Set the local offset values of the Collider 2D geometry. Radius Set the radius of the Circle Collider 2D in local space units. Layer Overrides Expand this option to use the",
