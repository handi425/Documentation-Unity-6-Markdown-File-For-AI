A collider doesn’t need to be exactly the same shape as the object’s mesh - a rough approximation is often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay. More info See in Glossary 2D that you must configure before it can be used correctly. Defining size and direction The settings that define the shape of the Capsule Collider A capsule-shaped collider component that handles collisions for GameObjects like barrels and",
    "character limbs. More info See in Glossary 2D are Size and Direction . Both the Size and Direction properties refer to X and Y (horizontal and vertical, respectively) in the local space of the Capsule Collider 2D, and not in world space. A typical way to set up the Capsule Collider 2D is to set the Size to match the Direction . For example, if the Capsule Collider 2D’s Direction is Vertical , the Size of X is 0.5 and the Size of Y is 1, this makes the vertical direction capsule taller, rather than wider. In the example below, the X and Y are represented by the yellow lines. An example of a Capsule Collider 2D set so the Size matches Direction Capsule configuration examples You can change the Capsule Collider 2D with different configurations. Below are some examples. Note that when the X and Y of the Size property are the same, the Capsule Collider 2D always approximates to a circle. Examples of Capsule Collider 2D configurations Note: A known issue in the 2D physics system is that when",
    "a GameObject The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. More info See in Glossary moves across multiple Colliders, one or several of the Colliders may register a collision A collision occurs when the physics engine detects that the colliders of two GameObjects make contact or overlap, when at least one has a Rigidbody component and is in motion. More info See in Glossary between the Colliders. This may occur even when the Colliders are perfectly aligned. This collision can cause the Collider to slow down or stop. While constructing a surface with the Capsule Collider 2D can help reduce this problem, it is recommeneded to use a single Collider rather than multiple Colliders for a surface, such as the Edge Collider 2D .
