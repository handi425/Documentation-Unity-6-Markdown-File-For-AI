A collider doesn’t need to be exactly the same shape as the object’s mesh - a rough approximation is often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay. More info See in Glossary 2D component is a Collider 2D that interacts with the 2D physics system. The capsule shape of the collider, with its smooth, round circumference and absence of vertex corners, allows for smoother movement along other colliders, preventing snagging on",
    "sharp corners. Note: The capsule shape of the collider is solid and not hollow. Unity regards any other Collider 2Ds that are inside the Capsule Collider A capsule-shaped collider component that handles collisions for GameObjects like barrels and character limbs. More info See in Glossary 2D to be in constant contact with the collider and gradually forced out of the Capsule Collider 2D over time. Property Function Material Select the Physics Material 2D Use to adjust the friction and bounce that occurs between 2D physics objects when they collide More info See in Glossary that determines properties of collisions A collision occurs when the physics engine detects that the colliders of two GameObjects make contact or overlap, when at least one has a Rigidbody component and is in motion. More info See in Glossary , such as friction and bounce. Is Trigger Enable this if you want this Collider 2D to behave as a trigger. The physics system ignores this Collider when this is enabled. Used by",
    "Effector Enable this if you want the Collider 2D to be used by an attached Effector 2D. Composite Operations Select the composite operation used by an attached Composite Collider 2D component. Note: When you select any operation besides None , the following properties— Material , Is Trigger , Used By Effector , and Edge Radius —become controlled by the attached Composite Collider 2D component and are no longer available in this collider’s properties. None Select this to have no composite operation take place. Merge Select this to have this composite operation compose geometry using a Boolean OR operation. Intersect Select this to have this composite operation compose geometry using a Boolean AND operation. Difference Select this to have this composite operation compose geometry using a Boolean NOT operation. Flip Select this to have this composite operation compose geometry using a Boolean XOR operation. Offset Set the local offset values of the Collider 2D geometry. Size Set the x and",
    "y values to define the size of the box region that the Capsule Collider 2D fills. Direction Select the orientation of the Capsule Collider 2D. This determines the position and orientation of the curved ends of the Collider shape. Refer to Configure Capsule Collider 2D for more details. Vertical Select this to orient the ends of the Collider shape upwards and downwards. Horizontal Select this to orient the ends of the Collider shape left and right. Layer Overrides Expand for the Layer override settings. Layer Override Priority Assign the decision priority that this Collider2D uses when resolving conflicting decisions on whether a contact between itself and another Collision2D should happen or not.

Force Send Layers Select the Layers that this Collider 2D is allowed to send forces to during a Collision contact with another Collider2D. Refer to its API documentation for more information. Force Receive Layers Select the Layers that this Collider 2D can receive forces from during a Collision contact with another Collider2D. Refer to its API documentation for more information. Contract Capture Layers Select the Layers of other Collider 2D, involved in contacts with this Collider2D, that will be captured. Refer to its API documentation for more information.
