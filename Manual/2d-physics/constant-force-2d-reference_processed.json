More info See in Glossary 2D is a quick utility for adding constant forces to a Rigidbody A component that allows a GameObject to be affected by simulated gravity and other forces. More info See in Glossary 2D . This works well for one-shot objects like rockets, if you want them to accelerate over time rather than starting with a large velocity. Constant Force 2D applies both linear and torque (angular) forces continuously to the Rigidbody 2D, each time the physics engine A",
    "system that simulates aspects of physical systems so that objects can accelerate correctly and be affected by collisions, gravity and other forces. More info See in Glossary updates at runtime. Properties Property Function Force The linear force applied to the Rigidbody 2D at each physics update. Relative Force The linear force, relative to the Rigidbody 2D coordinate system, applied each physics update. Torque The torque applied to the Rigidbody 2D at each physics update.
