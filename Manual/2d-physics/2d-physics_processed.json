You can use the following physics 2D components with Unity: Page Description Rigidbody 2D Learn how Rigidbody A component that allows a GameObject to be affected by simulated gravity and other forces. More info See in Glossary 2D works. Collider 2D Understand the types of Collider An invisible shape that is used to handle physical collisions for an object. A collider doesn’t need to be exactly the same shape as the object’s mesh - a rough approximation is often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay. More info See in Glossary 2D components available to use with",
    "Rigidbody 2D. Effectors 2D Approaches and techniques to working with the forces of physics when GameObject The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. More info See in Glossary colliders are in contact. 2D Joints Understand the types of 2D Joints A physics component allowing a dynamic connection between Rigidbody components, usually allowing some degree of movement such as a hinge. More info See in Glossary available to use with 2D GameObjects. Physics 2D Profiler Approaches to analyzing the performance of 2D physics in your application. Constant Force 2D reference Explore the properties that control constant forces A simple component for adding a constant force or torque to game objects with a Rigidbody. More info See in Glossary applied to a Rigidbody 2D. Physics Material 2D reference Explore the properties that control the friction and",
