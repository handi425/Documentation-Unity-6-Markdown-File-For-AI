A collider doesn’t need to be exactly the same shape as the object’s mesh - a rough approximation is often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay. More info See in Glossary 2Ds when another (target) Collider 2D comes into contact with the Effector 2D. You can configure the force at any angle with a specific magnitude and random variation on that magnitude. You can also apply both linear and angular drag forces to slow down",
    "Rigidbody A component that allows a GameObject to be affected by simulated gravity and other forces. More info See in Glossary 2Ds. Collider 2Ds that you use with the Area Effector 2D would typically be set as triggers, so that other Collider 2Ds can overlap with it to have forces applied. Non-triggers will still work, but forces will only be applied when Collider 2Ds come into contact with them. Properties Property Function Use Collider Mask Check to enable use of the Collider Mask property? If this is not enabled, the Global Collision A collision occurs when the physics engine detects that the colliders of two GameObjects make contact or overlap, when at least one has a Rigidbody component and is in motion. More info See in Glossary Matrix will be used as the default for all Collider 2Ds. Collider Mask The mask used to select specific Layers allowed to interact with the Area Effector 2D. Use Global Angle Check this to define the Force Angle as a global (world-space) angle. If this is",
    "not checked, the Force Angle is considered a local angle by the physics engine A system that simulates aspects of physical systems so that objects can accelerate correctly and be affected by collisions, gravity and other forces. More info See in Glossary . Force Angle The angle of the force to be applied. Force Magnitude The magnitude of the force to be applied. Force Variation The variation of the magnitude of the force to be applied. Drag The linear drag to apply to Rigidbody 2Ds. Angular Drag The angular drag to apply to Rigidbody 2Ds. Force Target The point on a target GameObject The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. More info See in Glossary where the Area Effector 2D applies any force. &#nbsp;&#nbsp;&#nbsp;&#nbsp; Collider The target point is defined as the current position of the Collider 2D. Applying force here can generate",
    "torque (rotation) if the Collider 2D isn’t positioned at the center of mass Represents the average position of all mass in a Rigidbody for the purposes of physics calculations. By default it is computed from all colliders belonging to the Rigidbody, but can be modified via script. More info See in Glossary . &#nbsp;&#nbsp;&#nbsp;&#nbsp; Rigidbody The target point is defined as the current center-of-mass of the Rigidbody 2D. Applying force here will never generate torque (rotation). AreaEffector2D Effectors 2D Buoyancy Effector 2D reference Copyright ©2005-2025 Unity Technologies. All rights reserved.
