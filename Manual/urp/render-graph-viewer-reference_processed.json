Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. More info See in Glossary in the Universal Render Pipeline A series",
    "of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. More info See in Glossary (URP). For more information about the Render Graph Viewer window, refer to Analyze a render graph . Toolbar Control Child control Description Capture Display the render graph for the current frame. Render graph Select the render graph from your project to display. Camera A component which creates an image of a particular viewpoint in your scene. The output is either drawn to the screen or captured as a texture. More info See in Glossary Select the camera to display the rendering loop for. Pass Filter Select which render passes to display. Nothing Display no render passes. Everything Display all render passes. Culled Display render passes that URP hasn’t included in the render graph because they have no effect on the final image. Raster Display only raster render passes created using",
    "renderGraph.AddRasterRenderPass . Unsafe Display only render passes that use Compatibility Mode APIs. Refer to Use Compatibility Mode APIs in render graph render passes . Compute Display only compute render passes created using renderGraph.AddComputePass . Resource Filter Select which resources to display. Nothing Display no resources. Everything Display all resources. Imported Display only resources imported into the render graph using ImportTexure . Textures Display only textures. Buffers Display only buffers. Acceleration Structures Display only acceleration structures used in compute render passes. Main window The main window is a timeline graph that displays the render passes in the render graph. It displays the following: On the left, the list of resources the render passes use, in the order URP creates them. At the top, the list of render passes, in the order URP executes them. At the point where a render pass and a texture meet on the graph, a resource access block displays how",
    "the render pass uses the resource. The access block uses the following icons and colors: Access block icon or color Description Dotted lines The resource hasn’t been created yet. Green The render pass has read-only access to the resource. The render pass can read the resource. Red The render pass has write-only access to the resource. The render pass can write to the resource. Green and red The render pass has read-write access to the resource. The render pass can read from or write to the resource. Grey The render pass can’t access the resource. Globe icon The render pass sets the texture as a global resource. If the globe icon has a gray background, the resource was imported into the render graph as a TextureHandle object, and the pass uses the SetGlobalTextureAfterPass API. Refer to Create a render graph texture and Transfer a texture between render passes . F The render pass can read the resource from on-chip GPU memory. Refer to Get the current framebuffer from GPU memory in URP .",
    "Blank The resource has been deallocated in memory, so it no longer exists. Select an access block to display the resource in the Resource List and the render pass in the Pass Inspector A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. More info See in Glossary List. Render passes Control Description Render pass name The name of the render pass. This name is set in the AddRasterRenderPass or AddComputePass method. Merge bar If URP merged this pass with other passes, the Render Graph Viewer displays a blue bar below the merged passes. Resource access overview bar When you select a render pass name, the resource access overview bar displays information about the pass you selected and related passes. Hover your cursor over an overview block for more information. Select an overview block to open the C# file for the render pass. Overview blocks use the following colors: White: The selected",
    "pass. Grey: The pass isn’t related to the selected pass. Blue: The pass reads from or writes to a resource the selected pass uses. Flashing blue: The pass reads from or writes to a resource the selected pass uses, and can be merged with the current pass. Resources Property Description Resource type The type of the resource. Refer to the following screenshot. Resource name The resource name. Imported resource Displays a left-facing arrow if the resource is imported. Refer to Import a texture into the render graph system . Render Graph Viewer icons The icons used as the resource type. A: A texture. B: An acceleration structure. C: A buffer. Resource List Select a resource in the Resource List to expand or collapse information about the resource. You can also use the Search bar to find a resource by name. Property Description Resource name The resource name. Imported resource Displays a left-facing arrow if the resource is imported. Size The resource size in pixels The smallest unit in a",
    "computer image. Pixel size depends on your screen resolution. Pixel lighting is calculated at every screen pixel. More info See in Glossary . Format The texture format A file format for handling textures during real-time rendering by 3D graphics hardware, such as a graphics card or mobile device. More info See in Glossary . For more information about texture formats, refer to GraphicsFormat . Clear Displays True if URP clears the texture. BindMS Whether the texture is bound as a multisampled texture. For more information about multisampled textures, refer to RenderTextureDescriptor.BindMS . Samples How many times Multisample Anti-aliasing (MSAA) samples the texture. Refer to Anti-aliasing . Memoryless Displays True if the resource is stored in tile memory on mobile platforms that use tile-based deferred rendering (TBDR). For more information about TBDR, refer to Render graph system introduction . Pass List Select a render pass in the main window to display information about the render",

If URP merged multiple passes, this property displays the names of all the merged passes. Native Render Pass Info Displays information about whether URP created a native render pass for this render pass by merging multiple render passes. For more information about native render passes, refer to Introduction to the render graph system . Pass break reasoning Displays the reasons why URP could not merge this render pass with the next render pass. Render Graph Pass Info The Render Graph Pass Info section displays information about the render pass, and each of the resources it uses. If URP merged multiple passes into this pass, the section displays information for each merged pass. Property Description Name The render pass name. Attachment dimensions The size of a resource the render pass uses, in pixels. Displays 0x0x0 if the render pass doesn’t use a",

Async compute Whether the render pass accesses the resource using a compute shader A program that runs on the GPU. More info See in Glossary . Attachments Load/Store Actions The Attachments Load/Store Actions section displays the resources the render pass uses. The section displays No attachments if the render pass doesn’t use any resources. Property Description Name The resource name. Load Action The load action for the resource. Refer to RenderBufferLoadAction . Store Action The store action for the resource, and how URP uses the resource later in another render pass or outside the graph. Refer to RenderBufferStoreAction .
