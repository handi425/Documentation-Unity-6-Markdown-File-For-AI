Pixel size depends on your screen resolution. Pixel lighting is calculated at every screen pixel.

The component’s Inspector A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. More info See in Glossary window Property Function Asset Pixels Per Unit This is the amount of pixels that make up one unit of the scene A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. More info See in Glossary . Match this value to the Pixels Per Unit values of all sprites A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during development. More info See in Glossary in the scene. Reference Resolution This is the original",
    "resolution your assets are designed for. Crop Frame Select what to do when there is a difference in aspect ratio The relationship of an image’s proportional dimensions, such as its width and height. See in Glossary . Grid Snapping Select what to do when snapping. Filter Mode (Only available when Stretch Fill option is selected.) Select the method Unity uses to upscale the final image. Current Pixel Ratio Shows the size ratio of the rendered sprites compared to their original size. Reference Resolution This is the original resolution your Assets are designed for. Scaling up scenes and assets from this resolution preserves your pixel art cleanly at higher resolutions. Grid Snapping options Upscale Render Texture By default, the scene is rendered at the pixel perfect resolution closest to the full screen resolution. Enable this option to have the scene rendered to a temporary texture set as close as possible to the Reference Resolution , while maintaining the full screen aspect ratio. This",
    "temporary texture is then upscaled to fit the entire screen. Box examples The result is unaliased and unrotated pixels, which may be a desirable visual style for certain game projects. Pixel Snapping Enable this feature to snap sprite Renderers A component that lets you display images as Sprites for use in both 2D and 3D scenes. More info See in Glossary to a grid in world space at render-time. The grid size is based on the Assets Pixels Per Unit value. Pixel Snapping prevents subpixel movement and make sprites appear to move in pixel-by-pixel increments. This does not affect any GameObjects The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. More info See in Glossary ’ Transform positions.

Defaults to Retro AA upscale filtering, where the image is upscaled as close as possible to the screen resolution as a multiple of the Reference resolution , followed by a bilinear filtering to upscale to the target screen resolution. Point filtering is also available for user preference. If you upscale the image this way, it can suffer from bad pixel placement, thus losing pixel perfectness. Point Retro AA Upscale Render Texture A special type of Texture that is created and updated at runtime. To use them, first create a new Render Texture and designate one of your Cameras to render into it. Then you can use the Render Texture in a Material just like a regular Texture.
