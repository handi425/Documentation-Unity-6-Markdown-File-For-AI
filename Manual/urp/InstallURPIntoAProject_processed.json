Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. More info See in Glossary , you can install URP and configure your Project to use URP. When you do this, you must configure URP yourself. You will need to manually convert or recreate parts of your Project (such as",
    "lit shaders or post-processing effects) to be compatible with URP. You can download and install the latest version of the Universal Render Pipeline (URP) to your existing Project via the Package Manager system , and then install it into your Project. If you don’t have an existing Project, refer to documentation on how to start a new URP Project from a Template . Before you begin URP uses its own integrated post-processing solution . If you have the Post Processing Version 2 package installed in your Project, you need to delete the Post Processing Version 2 package before you install URP into your Project. When you have installed URP, you can then recreate your post-processing A process that improves product visuals by applying filters and effects before the image appears on screen. You can use post-processing effects to simulate physical camera and film properties, for example Bloom and Depth of Field. More info post processing, postprocessing, postprocess See in Glossary effects.",
    "Projects made using URP are not compatible with the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) or the Built-in Render Pipeline. Before you start development, you must decide which render pipeline to use in your Project. For information on choosing a render pipeline, refer to the Render Pipelines section of the Unity Manual . Installing URP In Unity, open your Project. In the top navigation bar, select Window > Package Manager to open the Package Manager window. In the Packages menu, select Unity Registry . This shows the list of available packages for the version of Unity that you are currently running. Select Universal RP from the list of packages. In the bottom right corner of the Package Manager window, select Install . Unity installs URP directly into your Project. Configuring URP Before you can start using URP, you need to configure it. To do this, you need to create a Scriptable Render Pipeline Asset and adjust your Graphics settings. Creating the Universal Render Pipeline Asset The",
    "Universal Render Pipeline Asset (URP Asset) contains the global rendering and quality settings of your project, and creates the rendering pipeline instance. The rendering pipeline instance contains intermediate resources and the render pipeline implementation. To create a Universal Render Pipeline Asset: In the Editor, go to the Project window A window that shows the contents of your Assets folder (Project tab) More info See in Glossary . Right-click in the Project window, and select Create > Rendering > URP Asset (with Universal Renderer) . Alternatively, navigate to the menu bar at the top, and select Assets > Create > Rendering > URP Asset (with Universal Renderer) . You can either leave the default name for the new Universal Render Pipeline Asset, or type a new one. Set URP as the active render pipeline To set URP as the active render pipeline: In your project, locate the Render Pipeline Asset that you want to use. Tip : to find all URP Assets in a project, use the following query",
    "in the search field: t:universalrenderpipelineasset . Select Edit > Project Settings > Graphics . In the Scriptable Render Pipeline Settings field, select the URP Asset. When you select the URP Asset, the available Graphics settings change immediately. Optional : Set an override URP Assets for different quality levels: Select Edit > Project Settings > Quality . Select a quality level. In the Render Pipeline Asset field, select the Render Pipeline Asset.

More info See in Glossary made for the Built-in Render Pipeline, you must convert them to URP-compatible Unity shaders. For more information on this topic, refer to Upgrading your Shaders . Upgrade from the Built-in Render Pipeline When you upgrade a project from the Built-in Render Pipeline (BiRP) to the Universal Render Pipeline (URP), there are many changes which occur. These changes are wide reaching and",
