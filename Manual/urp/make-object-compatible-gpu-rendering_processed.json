A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. More info See in Glossary compatible with the GPU Resident Drawer , check it has the following properties: Has a Mesh",
    "Renderer component . In the Mesh The main graphics primitive of Unity. Meshes make up a large part of your 3D worlds. Unity supports triangulated or Quadrangulated polygon meshes. Nurbs, Nurms, Subdiv surfaces must be converted to polygons. More info See in Glossary Renderer component, Light Probes Light probes store information about how light passes through space in your scene. A collection of light probes arranged within a given space can improve lighting on moving objects and static LOD scenery within that space. More info See in Glossary isn’t set to Use Proxy Volume . Uses only static global illumination A group of techniques that model both direct and indirect lighting to provide realistic lighting results. See in Glossary , not real time global illumination. Uses a shader A program that runs on the GPU. More info See in Glossary that supports DOTS instancing. Refer to Supporting DOTS Instancing for more information. Doesn’t move position after one camera A component which",
    "creates an image of a particular viewpoint in your scene. The output is either drawn to the screen or captured as a texture. More info See in Glossary finishes rendering and before another camera starts rendering. Doesn’t use the MaterialPropertyBlock API. Doesn’t have a script that uses a per-instance callback, for example OnRenderObject . Exclude a GameObject from the GPU Resident Drawer To exclude a GameObject from the GPU Resident Drawer, add a Disallow GPU Driven Rendering component to the GameObject. Select the GameObject. In the Inspector A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. More info See in Glossary window, select Add Component . Select Disallow GPU Driven Rendering . Select Apply to Children Recursively to exclude both the GameObject and its children.
