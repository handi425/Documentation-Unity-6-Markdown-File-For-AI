More info See in Glossary , there are several techniques and considerations that are unique to the 2D Lighting graphics pipeline. Number of blend styles The easiest way to increase rendering performance is to reduce the number of blend styles used. Each blend style is a Render Texture A special type of Texture that is created and updated at runtime. To use them, first create a new Render Texture and designate one of your",
    "Cameras to render into it. Then you can use the Render Texture in a Material just like a regular Texture. More info See in Glossary that needs to be rendered and subsequently uploaded. Reducing the number of blend styles has a direct impact on the performance. For simple scenes a single blend style could suffice. It is also common to use up to 2 blend styles in a scene A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. More info See in Glossary . Light Render Texture scale The 2D Lighting system relies on screen space Light Render Texture to capture light contribution. This means there are a lot of Render Texture drawing subsequent uploading. Choosing the right Render Texture size directly impacts the performance. By default it is set at 0.5x of screen resolution. Smaller Light Render Texture size will",
    "give better performance at the cost of visual artifact. Half screen size resolution provides a good performance with almost no noticeable artifact in most situations. Experiment and find a scale suitable for your project. Layer Batching To further reduce the number of Light Render Textures, it is crucial to make the Sorting Layer batchable. Layers that are batched together share the same set of Light Render Textures. Uniquely lit layers will have its own set thus increasing the amount of work needed. Layers can be batch together if they share the same set of lights. Pre-rendering of Light Render Texture Multiple sets of Light Render Textures can be rendered ahead of drawing the Renderers. In an ideal situation, all the Light Render Textures will be rendered upfront and only then will the pipeline proceed with drawing the Renderers onto the final color output. This reduces the need to load/unload/reload of final color output. In a very complex setup with many distinctly lit Layers, it",
    "may not be practical to pre-render all Light Render Textures. The limit can be configured in the 2D Renderer Data inspector A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. More info See in Glossary . Normal Maps Using normal maps A type of Bump Map texture that allows you to add surface detail such as bumps, grooves, and scratches to a model which catch the light as if they are represented by real geometry. See in Glossary to simulate depth is currently a very expensive operation. If it is enabled, a full size Render Texture is created during a depth pre-pass and the Renderers are drawn onto it. This is done for each Layer batch. If the normal mapping effect to simulate depth perception is not needed, ensure that all lights have the normal map option disabled.
