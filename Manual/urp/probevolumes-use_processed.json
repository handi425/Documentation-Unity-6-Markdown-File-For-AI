Add and bake an Adaptive Probe Volume Enable Adaptive Probe Volumes From the main menu, select Edit > Project Settings > Quality . In the Rendering section, double-click the active Render Pipeline A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. More info See in Glossary Asset to open it in the Inspector A Unity window that displays information about the",
    "currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. More info See in Glossary window. In the Lighting section, set Light Probe Light probes store information about how light passes through space in your scene. A collection of light probes arranged within a given space can improve lighting on moving objects and static LOD scenery within that space. More info See in Glossary System to Adaptive Probe Volumes . Add an Adaptive Probe Volume to the Scene From the main menu, select GameObject > Light > Adaptive Probe Volumes > Adaptive Probe Volume . In the Inspector for the Adaptive Probe Volume, set Mode to Global to make this Adaptive Probe Volume cover your entire Scene A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. More info See in Glossary . Adjust",
    "your Light and Mesh Renderer settings To include a Light in an Adaptive Probe Volume’s baked lighting data, open the Inspector for the Light then set the Light Mode A Light property that defines the use of the Light. Can be set to Realtime, Baked and Mixed. More info See in Glossary to Mixed or Baked . To include a GameObject The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. More info See in Glossary in an Adaptive Probe Volume’s baked lighting data, open the Inspector for the GameObject and enable Contribute Global Illumination A group of techniques that model both direct and indirect lighting to provide realistic lighting results. See in Glossary . To make a GameObject receive baked lighting, open the Inspector for the GameObject, then in the Mesh The main graphics primitive of Unity. Meshes make up a large part of your 3D worlds. Unity supports",
    "triangulated or Quadrangulated polygon meshes. Nurbs, Nurms, Subdiv surfaces must be converted to polygons. More info See in Glossary Renderer component set Receive Global Illumination to Light Probes . Bake your lighting From the main menu, select Window > Rendering > Lighting . Select the Adaptive Probe Volumes panel. Set Baking Mode to Single Scene . Select Generate Lighting . If no scene in the Baking Set contains an Adaptive Probe Volume, Unity asks if you want to create an Adaptive Probe Volume automatically. You can change baking settings in the Lighting window’s Lightmapping Settings . Refer to Bake different lighting setups with Baking Sets for more information about Baking Sets. If there are visual artefacts in baked lighting, such as dark blotches or light leaks, refer to Fix issues with Adaptive Probe Volumes . Configure an Adaptive Probe Volume You can use the following to configure an Adaptive Probe Volume: Use the Adaptive Probe Volumes panel in the Lighting window to",
    "change the probe spacing and behaviour in all the Adaptive Probe Volumes in a Baking Set. Use the settings in the Adaptive Probe Volume Inspector window to change the Adaptive Probe Volume size and probe density. Add a Probe Adjustment Volume component to the Adaptive Probe Volume, to make probes invalid in a small area or fix other lighting issues. Add a Volume to your scene with a Probe Volumes Options Override , to change the way URP samples Adaptive Probe Volume data when the camera A component which creates an image of a particular viewpoint in your scene. The output is either drawn to the screen or captured as a texture. More info See in Glossary is inside the volume. This doesn’t affect baking.
