A collection of light probes arranged within a given space can improve lighting on moving objects and static LOD scenery within that space. More info See in Glossary easier to use by automating placement. They also provide higher quality, more accurate lighting, because they light per-pixel not per-object. Topic Description Introduction to Adaptive Probe Volumes The purpose of Adaptive Probe Volumes and what you can do with them. Use Adaptive Probe",
    "Volumes Add Adaptive Probe Volumes to your project and configure them. Display Adaptive Probe Volumes Visualize the structure of Adaptive Probe Volumes. Configure the size and density of Adaptive Probe Volumes Change the size of an Adaptive Probe Volume, or increase the density of Light Probes. Bake multiple scenes together with Baking Sets Add scenes A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces.
