    "Create a camera stack Create a camera stack with a Base Camera and one or more Overlay Cameras. For more information on how to do this, refer to Add a camera to a camera stack . Set up layers and culling masks Once you create your camera stack, you must assign any GameObjects The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. More info See in Glossary the Overlay Cameras need to render to a layer Layers in Unity can be used to selectively opt groups of GameObjects in or out of certain processes or calculations. This includes camera rendering, lighting, physics collisions, or custom calculations in your own code. More info See in Glossary , then set the Culling Mask Allows you to include or omit objects to be rendered by a Camera, by Layer. See in Glossary of each camera to match the layer.

    "your project requires. For information on how to do this, refer to Add a new layer . For each GameObject you want an Overlay Camera to render, assign the GameObject to the appropriate layer. Select the Base Camera of your camera stack and navigate to Rendering > Culling Mask in the Inspector Window. Remove any layers you don’t want the Base Camera to render, such as layers that contain objects only an Overlay Camera should render. Select the first Overlay Camera in the camera stack and navigate to Rendering > Culling Mask in the Inspector window. Remove all layers except for the layers that contain GameObjects you want this camera to render. Repeat Step 5 and Step 6 for each Overlay Camera in the camera stack. Note: You don’t need to configure the Culling Mask property of the cameras. However, cameras in URP render all layers by default, so rendering is faster if you remove layers that contain unneeded GameObjects.
