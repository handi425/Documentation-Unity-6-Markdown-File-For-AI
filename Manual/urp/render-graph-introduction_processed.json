Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. More info See in Glossary (URP). When you use the render graph API to create a Scriptable Render Pass, you tell URP the following: The",
    "textures or render textures A special type of Texture that is created and updated at runtime. To use them, first create a new Render Texture and designate one of your Cameras to render into it. Then you can use the Render Texture in a Material just like a regular Texture. More info See in Glossary to use. This stage is the recording stage. The graphics commands to execute, using the textures or render textures from the recording stage. This stage is the execution stage. You can then add your Scriptable Render Pass to the URP renderer . Your Scriptable Render Pass becomes part of URP’s internal render graph, which is the sequence of render passes URP steps through each frame. URP automatically optimizes your render pass and the render graph to minimize the number of render passes, and the memory and bandwidth the render passes use. How URP optimizes rendering URP does the following to optimize rendering in the render graph: Merges multiple render passes into a single render pass. Avoids",
    "allocating resources the frame doesn’t use. Avoids executing render passes if the final frame doesn’t use their output. Avoids duplicating resources, for example by replacing two texture that have the same properties with a single texture. Automatically synchronizes the compute and graphics GPU command queues. On mobile platforms that use tile-based deferred rendering (TBDR), URP can also merge multiple render passes into a single native render pass. A native render pass keeps textures in tile memory, rather than copying textures from the GPU to the CPU. As a result, URP uses less memory bandwidth and rendering time. To check how URP optimizes rendering in your custom render passes, refer to Analyze a render graph .
