Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. More info See in Glossary (URP) creates for the current frame, for example the active color buffer or a G-buffer texture, and use them in your render passes. These textures",
    "are called frame data, resource data, or frame resources. This documentation refers to these textures as frame data. Some textures might not exist in the frame data, depending on which injection point you use to insert your custom render pass into the URP frame rendering loop. For more information about which textures exist when, refer to Injection points reference . Get frame data The frame data is in the ContextContainer object that URP provides when you override the RecordRenderGraph method. Follow these steps to get a handle to a texture in the frame data: Get all the frame data as a UniversalResourceData object, using the Get method of the ContextContainer object. For example: public override void RecordRenderGraph(RenderGraph renderGraph, ContextContainer frameContext) { using (var builder = renderGraph.AddRasterRenderPass<PassData>(\"Get frame data\", out var passData)) { UniversalResourceData frameData = frameContext.Get<UniversalResourceData>(); } } Get the handle to a texture in",
    "the frame data. For example, the following gets a handle to the active color texture: TextureHandle activeColorTexture = frameData.activeColorTexture; You can then read from and write to the texture. Refer to Use a texture in a render pass . The texture handle is valid only for the current render graph in the current frame. You can use the ConfigureInput API to make sure URP generates the texture you need in the frame data. Example For a full example, refer to the example called TextureReference w.
