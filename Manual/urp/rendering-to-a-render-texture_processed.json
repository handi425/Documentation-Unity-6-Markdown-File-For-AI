Then you can use the Render Texture in a Material just like a regular Texture. More info See in Glossary . Rendering to a screen is the default and is the most common use case, but rendering to a Render Texture allows you to create effects such as CCTV camera monitors. If you have a Camera that is rendering to a Render Texture, you must have a second Camera that then renders that Render Texture to the screen. In URP, all Cameras that render to Render Textures perform their render loops before all Cameras that render to the screen. This ensures that the Render Textures are ready to render to the screen. For more information on Camera rendering order in URP, refer to Rendering order and overdraw . Render to a Render Texture that renders to the screen Create a Render Texture Asset in your project.

The first Camera now renders its view to the Render Texture. The second Camera renders the scene including the Render Texture to the screen. You can set the output target for a camera in a script by setting the targetTexture property of the camera: myCamera.targetTexture = myRenderTexture; Apply different post processing effects to separate cameras in URP Create a render request in URP Copyright ©2005-2025 Unity Technologies.
