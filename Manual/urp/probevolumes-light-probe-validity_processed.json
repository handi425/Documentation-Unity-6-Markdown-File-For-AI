The Universal Render Pipeline A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own.

    "light probes arranged within a given space can improve lighting on moving objects and static LOD scenery within that space. More info See in Glossary as invalid when the probe fires sampling rays to capture surrounding light data, but the rays hit the unlit backfaces inside geometry. URP uses the following techniques to minimise incorrect lighting data from Light Probes: Virtual Offset tries to make invalid Light Probes valid, by moving their capture points so they’re outside any colliders An invisible shape that is used to handle physical collisions for an object. A collider doesn’t need to be exactly the same shape as the object’s mesh - a rough approximation is often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay. More info See in Glossary . Dilation detects Light Probes that remain invalid after Virtual Offset, and gives them data from valid Light Probes nearby. Rendering Layers prevent objects from sampling probes that are on another Layer Mask A value defining which layers to",
