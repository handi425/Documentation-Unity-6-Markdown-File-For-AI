The Motion Blur effect simulates the blur that occurs in an image when a real-world camera A component which creates an image of a particular viewpoint in your scene. The output is either drawn to the screen or captured as a texture. More info See in Glossary films objects moving",
    "faster than the camera’s exposure time. This is usually due to rapidly moving objects, or a long exposure time. Universal Render Pipeline A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. More info See in Glossary (URP) only blurs camera motions. Properties Property Description Mode Select the motion blur technique. Options: Camera Only : use only the motion of the camera to blur the objects. This technique does not use the motion vectors. This technique has better performance than Camera and Objects . Camera and Objects : use the motion of both the camera and the GameObjects. GameObject motion vectors overwrite the camera motion vectors. Quality Set the quality of the effect. Lower presets give better performance, but at a lower visual quality and a higher risk of visual artifacts. Intensity Set the strength of the motion blur filter to a value from 0 to 1. Higher values",
    "give a stronger blur effect, but can cause lower performance, depending on the Clamp parameter. Clamp Set the maximum length that the velocity resulting from Camera rotation can have. This limits the blur at high velocity, to avoid excessive performance costs. The value is measured as a fraction of the screen’s full resolution. The value range is 0 to 0.2. A lower value uses less resources and results in better performance. The default value is 0.05.
