Light leaks often occur when geometry receives light from a Light Probe Light probes store information about how light passes through space in your scene. A collection of light probes arranged within a given space can improve lighting on moving objects and static LOD scenery within",
    "that space. More info See in Glossary that isn’t visible to the geometry, for example because the Light Probe is on the other side of a wall. Adaptive Probe Volumes use regular grids of Light Probes, so Light Probes might not follow walls or be at the boundary between different lighting areas. To fix light leaks, you can do the following: Create thicker walls . Add an Adaptive Probe Volumes Options override to your scene . Enable Rendering Layers . Adjust Baking Set properties . Use a Probe Adjustment Volume . Create thicker walls Adjust walls so their width is closer to the distance between probes in the local brick Add an Adaptive Probe Volumes Options override to your scene You can add a Volume , then add an Adaptive Probe Volumes Options override to the Volume. This adjusts the position that GameObjects The fundamental object in Unity scenes, which can represent characters, props, scenery, cameras, waypoints, and more. A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components",
    "attached to it. More info See in Glossary use to sample the Light Probes. Add a Volume to your scene A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. More info See in Glossary and make sure its area overlaps the camera A component which creates an image of a particular viewpoint in your scene. The output is either drawn to the screen or captured as a texture. More info See in Glossary position. Select Add Override , then select Lighting > Adaptive Probe Volumes Options . Enable Normal Bias , then adjust the value to move the position that GameObject pixels use to sample the Light Probes, along the pixel The smallest unit in a computer image. Pixel size depends on your screen resolution. Pixel lighting is calculated at every screen pixel. More info See in Glossary ’s surface normal. Enable View Bias ,",
    "then adjust the value to move the position that GameObject pixels use to sample the Light Probes, towards the camera. Disable and enable Leak Reduction Mode to check if it improves light leaks. Volumes only affect the scene if the camera is near or inside the volume. Refer to Understand volumes for more information. Refer to Probe Volumes Options Override reference for more information on Adaptive Probe Volumes Options settings. Use Rendering Layer Masks You can configure the Rendering Layer Masks A value defining which layers to include or exclude from an operation, such as rendering, collision or your own code. More info See in Glossary in the Adaptive Probe Volumes panel in the Lighting window. This allow APV to assign a Rendering Layer Mask to each Light Probe. For performance reasons, Adaptive Probe Volumes only supports up to 4 Rendering Layers Masks. You can use the list to create a new mask and use the dropdown to assign it any Rendering Layer. When lighting is generated, Unity",
    "will try to automatically assign a mask to each probe by looking at the Rendering Layer Masks of objects surrounding the probe. Additionally, you can use a Probe Adjustment Volume to override the Rendering Layer Mask assigned to Light Probes. At runtime, renderers will only sample lighting data from probes that have a matching Rendering Layer Mask. If the object doesn’t match any of the Masks defined in the Lighting window, it will sample lighting from all the valid surrounding probes. Note that this feature requires Use Rendering Layers to be enabled in the URP Asset. For example, in order to fix light leaking issues, you can create an Interior and an Exterior Rendering Layer Mask to ensure interior objects will never sample lighting data from exterior probes and fix light leaking through the walls. A renderer can have several Rendering Layers enabled in it’s Rendering Layer Masks. This is useful when dealing with dynamic objects that may want to sample lighting from both the exterior",
    "and interior probes. You can visualize which layers are assigned to a probe: - Go to the Probe Volumes tab - Enable Display Probes - Set the Probe Shading Mode field to Rendering Layer Masks - Use the toggles in the Scene View An interactive view into the world you are creating. You use the Scene View to select and position scenery, characters, cameras, lights, and all other types of Game Object. More info See in Glossary Overlay to hide Probes matching a Rendering Layer Mask Adjust Baking Set properties If adding a Volume doesn’t work, use the Adaptive Probe Volumes panel in the Lighting window to adjust Virtual Offset and Dilation settings. In Probe Dilation Settings , reduce Search Radius . This can help in situations where invalid Light Probes are receiving lighting data from more distant Light Probes. However, a lower Search Radius might cause light leaks. In Virtual Offset Settings , reduce Search Distance Multiplier and Ray Origin Bias . If there are light leaks in multiple",
    "locations, adjust Min Probe Spacing and Max Probe Spacing to increase the density of Light Probes. Select Generate Lighting to rebake the scene using the new settings. Note: Don’t use very low values for the settings, or Dilation and Virtual Offset might not work. Add a Probe Adjustment Volume component Use a Probe Adjustment Volume component to make Light Probes invalid in a small area. This triggers Dilation during baking, and improves the results of Leak Reduction Mode at runtime. In the Adaptive Probe Volume Inspector, select Add Component , then select Light > Probe Adjustment Volume . Set the Size so the Probe Adjustment Volume area overlaps the Light Probes causing light leaks. Set Probe Volume Overrides > Mode to Invalidate Probes , to invalidate the Light Probes in the Volume. If you have a Volume with a Probe Volumes Options override , enable Leak Reduction Mode . In Probe Volume Settings , select Generate Lighting to rebake the scene using the new settings. Using a Probe",
    "Adjustment Volume component solves most light leak issues, but often not all. If you use many Probe Adjustment Volumes in a scene, your bake will be slower, and your scene might be harder to understand and maintain. Refer to Probe Adjustment Volume component reference for more information. Fix seams Seams are artefacts that appear when one lighting condition transitions immediately into another. Seams are caused when two adjacent bricks have different Light Probe densities. Refer to bricks for more information. To fix seams, do the following: Add a Volume to your scene and make sure its area overlaps the position of the camera. Select Add Override , then select Lighting > Probe Volumes Options . Enable Sampling Noise , then try adjusting the value to add noise and make the transition more diffuse. Noise can help break up noticeable edges in indirect lighting at brick boundaries.
