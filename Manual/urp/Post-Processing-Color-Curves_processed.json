You can adjust the curves in eight available graphs to achieve effects such as specific hue replacement or desaturating certain luminosities. Properties Curve Description Master This curve affects the luminance across the whole image. The x-axis of the graph represents input luminance and the",
    "y-axis represents output luminance. You can use this to further adjust the appearance of basic attributes such as contrast and brightness across all color channels at the same time. Red This curve affects the red channel intensity across the whole image. The x-axis of the graph represents input intensity and the y-axis represents output intensity for the red channel. Green This curve affects the green channel intensity across the whole image. The x-axis of the graph represents input intensity and the y-axis represents output intensity for the green channel. Blue This curve affects the blue channel intensity across the whole image. The x-axis of the graph represents input intensity and the y-axis represents output intensity for the blue channel. Hue Vs Hue This curve shifts the input hue (x-axis) according to the output hue (y-axis). You can use this to fine tune hues of specific ranges or perform color replacement. Hue Vs Sat This curve adjusts saturation (y-axis) according to the input",
    "hue (x-axis). You can use this to tone down particularly bright areas or create artistic effects such as monochromatic except a single dominant color. Sat Vs Sat This curve adjusts saturation (y-axis) according to the input saturation (x-axis). You can use this to fine tune saturation adjustments made with Color Adjustments . Lum Vs Sat This curve adjusts saturation (y-axis) according to the input luminance (x-axis). You can use this to desaturate areas of darkness to provide an interesting visual contrast.
