A Shader object can contain multiple shader",
    "variants. More info See in Glossary . If you disable features in the URP Asset , URP automatically excludes (‘strips’) the related shader variants. This speeds up builds, and reduces memory usage and file sizes. For example, if your project doesn’t use shadows for directional lights, by default Unity still includes variants that support directional light shadows in your build. If you disable Cast Shadows in the URP Asset, URP strips these variants. If you want to examine the code that strips shaders in URP, check the Editor/ShaderPreprocessor.cs file. The file uses the IPreprocessShaders API. For more information on stripping shader variants, refer to the following pages: Check how many shader variants you have . General guidance on shader stripping , which applies to all render pipelines. Check how many shader variants your build has To log how many variants Unity compiles and strips in total, follow these steps: Open the Graphics settings window . In the Shader Stripping section,",

For the location of Editor.log , refer to log files . To log more detailed shader variant information, follow these steps: Open the Graphics settings window . In the Additional Shader Stripping Settings section, select Export Shader Variants . Build your project. In the folder with your project files, open Temp/graphics-settings-stripping.json and Temp/shader-stripping.json . For more information, refer to the following in the Unity User Manual: Check how many shader variants you have Shader variant stripping Strip feature shader variants By default, URP compiles variants where a feature is enabled, and variants where a feature is disabled. To reduce the number of variants, you can enable Strip Unused Variants in URP Graphics settings and do the following: Disable a feature in all URP Assets in your build, so URP keeps only",
    "variants where the feature is disabled. Enable a feature in all URP Assets in your build, so URP keeps only variants where the feature is enabled. If you disable the Strip Unused Variants setting , URP can’t strip variants where the feature is disabled. This might increase the number of variants. Disable a feature To let Unity strip variants related to a feature, make sure you disable it in all the URP Assets in your build. Unity includes the following URP Assets in your build: The URP Asset you set as the default render pipeline asset in Graphics settings . Any URP Asset you set as a Render Pipeline Asset in a Quality settings level you enable for the current build target. Avoid including URP Assets in your build that use different rendering paths The technique that a render pipeline uses to render graphics. Choosing a different rendering path affects how lighting and shading are calculated. Some rendering paths are more suited to different platforms and hardware than others. More info",
