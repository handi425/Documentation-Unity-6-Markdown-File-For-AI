See in Glossary effect darkens creases, holes, intersections and surfaces that are close to each other in real-time. In the real world, such areas tend to block out or occlude ambient light Light that doesn’t come from any specific direction, and",
    "contributes equal light in all directions to the Scene. More info See in Glossary , so they appear darker. URP implements the Screen Space Ambient Occlusion (SSAO) effect as a Renderer Feature . It works with every shader A program that runs on the GPU. More info See in Glossary that the Universal Render Pipeline A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. More info See in Glossary (URP) provides as well as any custom opaque Shader Graphs you create. Note : The SSAO effect is a Renderer Feature and works independently from the post-processing A process that improves product visuals by applying filters and effects before the image appears on screen. You can use post-processing effects to simulate physical camera and film properties, for example Bloom and Depth of Field. More info post processing, postprocessing, postprocess See in Glossary effects in URP. This effect",
    "does not depend on or interact with Volumes. The following images show a scene A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. More info See in Glossary with the Ambient Occlusion effect turned off, on, and only the Ambient Occlusion texture. Scene with Ambient Occlusion effect turned off. Scene with Ambient Occlusion effect turned on. Scene with only the Ambient Occlusion texture. Implementation details The SSAO Renderer Feature uses normal vectors for calculating how exposed each point on a surface is to ambient lighting. URP 10.0 implements the DepthNormals Pass block that generates the the normal texture _CameraNormalsTexture for the current frame. By default, the SSAO Renderer Feature uses this texture to calculate Ambient Occlusion values. If you implement your custom SRP and if you do not want",
    "to implement the DepthNormals Pass block in your shaders, you can use the SSAO Renderer Feature and set its Source property to Depth . In this case, Unity does not use the DepthNormals Pass to generate the normal vectors, it reconstructs the normal vectors using the depth texture instead. Selecting the option Depth in the Source property enables the Normal Quality property. The options in this property (Low, Medium, and High) determine the number of samples of the depth texture that Unity takes when reconstructing the normal vector from the depth texture. The number of samples per quality level: Low: 1, Medium: 5, High: 9.
