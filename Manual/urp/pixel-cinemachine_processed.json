Pixel size depends on your screen resolution. Pixel lighting is calculated at every screen pixel.

Both systems modify the Camera’s orthographic size, so using these two systems together in a single scene A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. More info See in Glossary would cause them to fight for control over the Camera and produce unwanted results. The Cinemachine Pixel Perfect extension solves this incompatibility. Cinemachine Pixel Perfect is an extension for the Cinemachine Virtual Camera that alters the orthographic size of the virtual camera. The extension detects the presence of the Pixel Perfect Camera component, and uses the component settings to calculate for the correct orthographic size of the virtual camera that best retains the Sprites A 2D graphic",

If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during development. More info See in Glossary in a pixel-perfect resolution. To add this extension to your virtual cameras, use the Add Extension dropdown menu on the Cinemachine Virtual Camera Inspector A Unity window that displays information about the currently selected GameObject, asset or project settings, allowing you to inspect and edit the values. More info See in Glossary window. Add this extension to each virtual camera in your Project. For each virtual camera attached with this extension, the Pixel Perfect Camera component then calculates a pixel-perfect orthographic size that best matches the original size of the virtual camera during Play Mode or when Run In Edit Mode is enabled. This is done to match the original framing of each virtual camera as close as possible when the",
    "pixel-perfect calculations are implemented. When the Cinemachine Brain component blends Transition from one animation to another animation smoothly and seamlessly, such as blending a character’s walking and running animations according to the character’s speed. See in Glossary between multiple virtual cameras, the rendered image is temporarily not pixel-perfect during the transition between cameras. The image becomes pixel-perfect once the view fully transitions to a single virtual camera. The following are the current limitations of the extension: When a virtual camera with the Pixel Perfect extension is set to follow a Target Group , there may be visible choppiness when the virtual camera is positioned with the Framing Transposer component. If the Upscale Render Texture A special type of Texture that is created and updated at runtime. To use them, first create a new Render Texture and designate one of your Cameras to render into it. Then you can use the Render Texture in a Material",

More info See in Glossary option is enabled on the Pixel Perfect Camera, there are less possible pixel-perfect resolutions that match the original orthographic size of the virtual cameras. This may cause the framing of the virtual cameras to be off by quite a large margin after the pixel-perfect calculations.
