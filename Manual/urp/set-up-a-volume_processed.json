More info See in Glossary component, adjust the Size and Center properties so the collider occupies the volume where you want the local post-processing effect to be. Ensure Is Trigger is enabled in the Box Collider A cube-shaped collider component that handles collisions for GameObjects like dice and ice cubes. More info See in Glossary component.
