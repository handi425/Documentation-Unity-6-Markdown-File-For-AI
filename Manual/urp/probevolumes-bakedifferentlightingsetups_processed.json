    "Unity - Manual: Bake different lighting setups with Lighting Scenarios Manual Scripting API unity.com Version: Unity 6 (6000.0) Supported Legacy Language : English English 中文 日本語 한국어 Unity Manual Version: Unity 6 Select a different version Language : English English 中文 日本語 한국어 Lighting Lighting in URP Adaptive Probe Volumes (APV) in URP Changing lighting at runtime Bake different lighting setups with Lighting Scenarios Choose how to change lighting at runtime Update light from the sky at runtime with sky occlusion Bake different lighting setups with Lighting Scenarios A Lighting Scenario contains the baked lighting data for a scene A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. More info See in Glossary or Baking Set. You can bake different lighting setups into different Lighting Scenario assets,",
    "and change which one the Universal Render Pipeline A series of operations that take the contents of a Scene, and displays them on a screen. Unity lets you choose from pre-built render pipelines, or write your own. More info See in Glossary (URP) uses at runtime. For example, you can create one Lighting Scenario with the lights on, and another Lighting Scenario with the lights off. At runtime, you can enable the second Lighting Scenario when the player turns the lights off. Enable Lighting Scenarios To use Lighting Scenarios, go to the active URP Asset and enable Lighting > Light Probe Lighting > Lighting Scenarios . Add a Lighting Scenario To create a new Lighting Scenario so you can store baking results inside, do the following: Open the Adaptive Probe Volumes panel in the Lighting window. In the Lighting Scenarios section, select the Add ( + ) button to add a Lighting Scenario. Bake into a Lighting Scenario To bake into a Lighting Scenario, follow these steps: In the Lighting",
    "Scenarios section, select a Lighting Scenario to make it active. Select Generate Lighting . URP stores the baking results in the active Lighting Scenario. You can set which Lighting Scenario URP uses at runtime using the ProbeReferenceVolume API . If you change the active Lighting Scenarios at runtime, URP changes only the indirect lighting data in the Light Probes Light probes store information about how light passes through space in your scene. A collection of light probes arranged within a given space can improve lighting on moving objects and static LOD scenery within that space. More info See in Glossary . You might still need to use scripts A piece of code that allows you to create your own Components, trigger game events, modify Component properties over time and respond to user input in any way you like. More info See in Glossary to move geometry, modify lights or change direct lighting. Blend between Lighting Scenarios To enable blending between Lighting Scenarios, go to the",
    "active URP Asset and enable Light Probe Lighting > Scenario Blending . You can blend between Lighting Scenarios at runtime using the BlendLightingScenario API . For example, the following script does the following: Sets scenario01 as the active Lighting Scenario. Sets up the number of cells to blend per frame, which can be useful for optimization purposes. Updates the Adaptive Probe Volume blending factor every frame to blend between scenario01 and scenario02 . using System.Collections; using System.Collections.Generic; using UnityEngine; public class BlendLightingScenarios : MonoBehaviour { UnityEngine.Rendering.ProbeReferenceVolume probeRefVolume; public string scenario01 = \"Scenario01Name\"; public string scenario02 = \"Scenario02Name\"; [Range(0, 1)] public float blendingFactor = 0.5f; [Min(1)] public int numberOfCellsBlendedPerFrame = 10; void Start() { probeRefVolume = UnityEngine.Rendering.ProbeReferenceVolume.instance; probeRefVolume.lightingScenario = scenario01;",
    "probeRefVolume.numberOfCellsBlendedPerFrame = numberOfCellsBlendedPerFrame; } void Update() { probeRefVolume.BlendLightingScenario(scenario02, blendingFactor); } } Preview blending between Lighting Scenarios You can use the Rendering Debugger to preview transitions between Lighting Scenarios. Follow these steps: Go to Window > Analysis > Rendering Debugger to open the Rendering Debugger. Set Scenario Blend Target to a Lighting Scenario. Use Scenario Blending Factor to check the effect of blending between the Lighting Scenarios in the Scene view An interactive view into the world you are creating. You use the Scene View to select and position scenery, characters, cameras, lights, and all other types of Game Object. More info See in Glossary . Keep Light Probes the same in different Lighting Scenarios If you move static geometry between bakes, Light Probe positions might be different. This means you can’t blend between Lighting Scenarios, because the number of Light Probes and their",
    "positions must be the same in each Lighting Scenario you blend between. To avoid this, you can prevent URP recomputing probe positions when you bake. Follow these steps: Bake one Lighting Scenario. Set another Lighting Scenario as the active Lighting Scenario. Change your scene lighting or geometry. In the Probe Placement section, set Probe Positions to Don’t Recalculate . Select Generate Lighting to recompute only the indirect lighting, and skip the probe placement computations.
