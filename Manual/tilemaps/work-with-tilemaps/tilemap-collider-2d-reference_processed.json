A collider doesn’t need to be exactly the same shape as the object’s mesh - a rough approximation is often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay. More info See in Glossary 2D component generates collider shapes for tiles A simple class that allows a sprite to be rendered on a Tilemap. More info See in Glossary on a Tilemap A GameObject that allows you to quickly create 2D levels using tiles and a grid",
    "overlay. More info See in Glossary . You control this collider generation process with the properties found in the component. Properties Property Description Max Tile Change Count Set the maximum number of tile changes (such as adding/removing tiles to the tilemap) to accumulate before doing a full collider rebuild instead of an incremental rebuild. Note: A high number of accumulated changes can cause the incremental rebuild of the Tilemap Collider 2D to be slower than a full rebuild. Decrease this value to resolve this issue. Extrusion Factor Set the amount (in Unity world space units) to extrude the collider shape of each tile. This minimizes the gaps between the collider shapes of neighboring tiles and brings them to within the minimum Vertex Distance set in the Composite Collider 2D component., which can then compose the tile colliders together. Note: This property isn’t available by default. It becomes available when you select a Composite Operation and attach a Composite Collider",

Material Select the Physics Material 2D Use to adjust the friction and bounce that occurs between 2D physics objects when they collide More info See in Glossary that determines properties of collisions A collision occurs when the physics engine detects that the colliders of two GameObjects make contact or overlap, when at least one has a Rigidbody component and is in motion. More info See in Glossary , such as friction and bounce. Is Trigger Enable this if you want this Collider 2D to behave as a trigger. The physics system ignores this collider when this is enabled. Used by Effector Enable this if you want the Collider 2D to be used by an attached Effector 2D . Composite Operations Select the composite operation used by an attached Composite Collider 2D component. Note: When you select any operation besides None , the following properties— Material , Is Trigger , Used By Effector , and Edge Radius —become controlled by the attached Composite Collider 2D",

Merge Select this to have this composite operation compose geometry using a Boolean OR operation. Intersect Select this to have this composite operation compose geometry using a Boolean AND operation. Difference Select this to have this composite operation compose geometry using a Boolean NOT operation. Flip Select this to have this composite operation compose geometry using a Boolean XOR operation. Offset Set the local offset values of the Collider 2D geometry.
