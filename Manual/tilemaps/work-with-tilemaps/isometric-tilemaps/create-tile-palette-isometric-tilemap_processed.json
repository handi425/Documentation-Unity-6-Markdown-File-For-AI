More info See in Glossary : Open the Tile Palette window. To do this, go to the top menu and select Window > 2D > Tile Palette : Select the Create New Palette to open its drop-down menu. Select Create New Palette . Set the Grid type to the same layout as the Isometric or Isometric Z As Y Tilemap you are painting. Set Cell",
    "Size to Manual . Leave X and Z at their default values, but set Y to the same value as the Y value of the Tilemap’s Cell Size. This value depends on the projection type of the Tilemap. Refer to the Creating an Isometric Tilemap page for more details. Set the Cell Size property. Select Create to finalize your settings and create the new Tile Palette Asset . To make any changes to the Tile Palette, double-click the Asset in the Asset Folder to open it as a Prefab An asset type that allows you to store a GameObject complete with components and properties. The prefab acts as a template from which you can create new object instances in the scene. More info See in Glossary and make your changes there. Adjusting the Tile height in the Palette When painting Tiles on an Isometric Z as Y Tilemap , you define the Z position of the Grid you are painting on by setting the Z Position value. For this type of Tilemap, the Z position value translates into an offset along the Y-axis, and Tiles painted",
    "with different Z positions appear to have different heights on the Tilemap. To do this, use the following steps: Select the tile palette and open it in the Tile Palette window. Adjust the Z Position by entering the desired value (only whole numbers). The Z Position is at the bottom of the Tile Palette. Note : Tiles are painted on a Grid with the set Z position until the value is changed or reset. To change the value back to the default of 0, select Reset . In the Scene A Scene contains the environments and menus of your game. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces. More info See in Glossary view, the brush preview now displays both the Tile at the Cell’s original position with a Z value of 0 as a blue outline, and its painted position with the Z-as-Y offset applied is displayed with a white outline. The Z Position of a brush can also be adjusted with",
    "keyboard shortcuts. For more information on this, refer to Isometric brush shortcut reference . Note : To remove Tiles, the Erase Brush must have the same Z Position as the target Tile to be removed. The Erase Brush does not erase Tiles painted on at a different Z position to it.
