More info See in Glossary to construct a 2D environment. Each Tile references a selected Sprite A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for combining and managing sprite textures for efficiency and convenience during development. More info See in Glossary , which is then rendered at the Tile’s location on the Tilemap Grid . Refer to Creating Tiles for more information about",
    "preparing and importing sprites for your Tiles, and the different methods for creating the Assets in the Editor. Asset properties Property Function Preview Displays a visual preview of the selected Tile. Sprite Select the Sprite to be rendered on this Tile. Click the circle icon to the right to open the object picker window to select from the available Sprite Assets, or drag a Sprite directly onto this box. Color Tints the Sprite placed on this Tile with the selected Color. When set to white, the Sprite is rendered without a tint. Collider An invisible shape that is used to handle physical collisions for an object. A collider doesn’t need to be exactly the same shape as the object’s mesh - a rough approximation is often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay. More info See in Glossary Type Defines the shape of the Collider generated for the Tile. None No Collider is generated. Sprite The Collider shape is generated based on the selected Sprite’s outline. Grid The Collider",
    "shape is based on a cell of the Tilemap . The shape of a cell depends on the Cell Layout of the Tilemap. Collider shape The Collider Type set in the Tile Asset properties affects the generation of Collider shapes for each Tile in the Tilemap. The component’s shape generation behavior corresponds to the Collider Types in the following ways: Collider Type Function None The Tilemap Collider 2D component does not generate any Collider shapes for this Tile. Sprite The Tilemap Collider 2D component generates a Collider shape based on the Sprite assigned to the Tile. The Collider shape is based on the Custom Physics Shape set for the Sprite. Grid The Tilemap Collider 2D component generates a Collider shape based on the shape of the Grid cell, which is determined by the selected Cell Layout of the Grid component.
