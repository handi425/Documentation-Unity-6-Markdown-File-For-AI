A GameObject’s functionality is defined by the Components attached to it. More info See in Glossary , such as Tiles A simple class that allows a sprite to be rendered on a Tilemap. More info See in Glossary , based on a selected layout. The component transforms Grid cell positions to the corresponding local coordinates of the GameObject. The Transform component then converts these local coordinates to world space or global",
    "coordinates . Property Function Cell Size The size of a cell on this Grid. Cell Gap Enter the size (in Unity units) of gaps between cells on this Grid. If a negative number with an absolute value higher than the Cell Size is entered, then Unity will automatically change the absolute value to match the Cell Size instead. For example, if Cell Size is (1, 1, 0) and Cell Gap is set to (–2, –2, 0), the Editor will automatically change the Cell Gap values to (–1, –1, 0) instead. Cell Layout Select an option from the drop-down menu to define the shape and arrangement of cells on this Grid. Rectangle Cells are rectangular. Hexagon Cells are hexagonal. Isometric Cells are rhombus-shaped for an isometric layout. Isometric Z as Y Similar to the Isometric Grid layout, but Unity converts the Z position of cells to their local Y coordinate. Cell Swizzle Select the order that Unity reorders the XYZ cell coordinates to for transform conversions. See the Wikipedia article on Swizzling for more details.",
    "XYZ The Grid component uses the default XYZ cell coordinates. XZY The Grid component reorders the XYZ coordinates to XZY. YXZ The Grid component reorders the XYZ coordinates to YXZ. YZX The Grid component reorders the XYZ coordinates to YZX. ZXY The Grid component reorders the XYZ coordinates to ZXY. ZYX The Grid component reorders the XYZ coordinates to ZYX.
