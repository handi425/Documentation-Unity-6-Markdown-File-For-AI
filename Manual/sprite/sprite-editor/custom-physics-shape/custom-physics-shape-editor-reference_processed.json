Pixel size depends on your screen resolution. Pixel lighting is calculated at every screen pixel. More info See in Glossary . Outline Tolerance Use this slider to control how tightly and accurately the generated outline follows the outline of the Sprite A 2D graphic objects. If you are used to working in 3D, Sprites are essentially just standard textures but there are special techniques for combining and",

At the minimum value (0), the Sprite Editor generates a basic outline around the Sprite. At the maximum value (1), the Sprite Editor generates an outline that follows the outline of the Sprite as closely as possible. Generate When you click this button, Unity automatically creates a physics shape outline based on the Outline Tolerance value you set. Copy After you have generated or set up a custom physics shape, click this Copy button to duplicate the custom physics shape. Leaving the Custom Physics Shape module or closing the Sprite Editor removes the copied physics shape from memory. Paste Use this button to paste a copied physics shape to the currently selected Sprite. If you have not used the Copy function to copy a physics shape, this button is not available. To Paste a copied custom physics shape to another Sprite, in the Project window A window that shows the contents of",
    "your Assets folder (Project tab) More info See in Glossary select the Sprite while the Custom Physics Shape editor window is open. Then click the Paste button to paste the copied physics shape to the new Sprite. When you paste the physics shape, if a point in the physics shape is larger than the Sprite’s frame, Unity clamps the point to be inside the Sprite’s frame. Paste All Use this button to paste a copied physics shape to all sprites in the Sprite Editor window, regardless of selection. If you have not used the Copy function to copy a physics shape, this button is not available. Use this function to apply the same physics shape to multiple sprites in the same Texture (such as when a Texture has its Sprite Mode set to ‘Multiple’). When you paste the physics shape, if a point in the physics shape exceeds the Sprite’s frame, Unity clamps the point to be inside that Sprite’s frame.
